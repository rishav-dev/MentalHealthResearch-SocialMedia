On the way to the university suddenly my heart rate sped up, I felt dizzy, and I couldn't breathe. I was sure I was about to pass out. My jaw was clenching uncontrollably, and I felt a tingling sensation in my hands and face. My heart ached, and my mouth was completely dry. I was convinced I was going to die. I couldn't stay still and was constantly pacing in circles. I didn't know what was happening to me and wanted to call an ambulance, but at the time I didn't have insurance and I knew I couldn't afford it. I somehow managed to fall asleep at home, but when I woke up, I felt EVEN WORSE. They took me to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't find anything, recommend to contact psychiatry, and sent me home.  ​The symptoms felt like a panic attack, but what really crushed me was that this state lasted for 5 days straight, without stopping. It was true hell, even though there were occasional, short moments of relief. ​A psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants (sertralina) and a benzodiazepines. I started to feel better, but I was left with the feeling that something in my head had changed forever.   I took the pills for four years, and everything seemed fine. But five months after I stopped taking them, the same symptoms came back, only about twice as strong. This state lasted for two full days, and I went back to the doctor. They added another medication, Pregabalina, and for 13 days, I was essentially sedated with benzodiazepines, just trying to sleep all day. The only relief was in the first few minutes after waking up, when I felt better.  ​The doctor says I have generalized anxiety disorder, but I disagree. The attacks started for no reason, when I was calm—just reading a book or walking down the street. I feel scared only when I feel bad.  ​The worst part now is that I've started having problems with my memory and concentration (or rather, I've started noticing them). I remember almost nothing in details from my past; I have to reconstruct all the details from old notes and records. I can read a book, see the words, but can't understand or remember them. During simple calculations, like 37+46, I can ""freeze"" midway through and have to start over. I feel stupid. My cognitive functions have gotten several times worse. I can take 30 minutes to solve a simple task, getting stuck and having to restart. A single page of a book can take me 15 minutes to read. ​I'm unsure about everything.   Has anyone here ever experienced symptoms like this that lasted for several days in a row and have you had similar problems with concentration, memory, and decision-making?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nluy3z/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nluy3z/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/
1nlwlsu,1758370425,2025-09-20T12:13:45Z,depression,Boyfriend is having a really deep depression phase...idk what to do anymore...,"so...idk if that is against the rules...or if its the right sub...but Idk what I can do anymore.  So we've been together since 2 and a half year so far and have been through my mental health issues that appear sometimes(bullying in my former school) and short and long phases of his depression. We or he with a little bit of my help have gone through this every time..and it got better for a while, it's an up and down all time. but It feels like this phase is *deeper* than any other I experienced with him.I have had 2 crash outs so far because of this...I am a very sensitive person and get affected by stuff easily and process it slow.  He has a Diagnosed Depression since (he got bullied and excluded since Kindergarden; no Details here) I think 3-4 years. He had Therapy once but it wasn't the right one as it seems, as it, coming from him, didn't help that much. And now he doesn't want to start a new one because he thinks no therapy will work on him. I tried to encourage him..(well I completely communicated the wrong way; I begged him to try a new kind of therapy which wasn't my smartest move, but the damage is done) but he said and said before that he doesn't want to start a new one because its useless anyway. I wont force him to start a new one, he has to do it willingly. So I will not ask him about it anymore(at least not while he has a deep depression phase).  He also says typical depression stuff like ""I feel less worth because I chose a lower level of education.""For context, we are continuing school and he had to get a lower level because his grades weren't good enough for the higher level(one of the reasons) and the school he wanted on would most likely haven't taken him. He could have gone the same school I am- but the way would be really far.  Yesterday he texted me that quote ""I am objectively a bad human, because A) I am pessimistic, B) I have no talent, C) I am bad in school, D) I am a Narcisst, E)I have a dark humor and F) I hate most people without even knowing them"". Point B isn't true at all- he has the talent to simplify stuff and make any topic interesting(When he knows about it). He also isn't a narcist- he just needs more attention than most people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The whole thing started like 2 Days ago and he had crash outs in his school apprenticeship before. He tells me that nobody would care about it anyways, which is just how he picks it up. I am very concerned about this, but due to depression he doesn't realize it. He says the Therapy doesn't work on him, because the problem is him. He also told me he preferred not telling me about his problems and that he hates that he always speaks out everything. I think one reason he tells me that is because he trusts me deep within, even if he doesn't realize it right now. He normally just tells me stuff that not everyone knows just because he trusts me. So maybe thats a part of the reason?  He also once told me that he wants to kill himself, that was a a few days ago. Still Idk what to say to him or how to react.  I want to help, but I know I can't help, it's a dilemma. I don't know how to deal with his words and my feelings when he tells me such stuff. I am always open for his problems to make him feel save and I want to know what's going on in his live too. But idk how I can protect myself from overworrying about him, which happens regularly. He also doesn't tell his parents about it because he thinks that they will not understand him(Which I can comprehend, I also don't tell my parents everything because I know they wont understand certain topics and I can't explain my feelings to them like I want to plus my parents and his are downgrading certain things; personally its like panic attacks) and I know that some of it they indeed wont understand.  I am worried almost all the time...I just can't get my mind of it. Right now he wants to be alone it seems so I will leave him his space and respect his decision. I really don't know what to say or do anymore- thats why I'm asking. I don't want to hurt him...I also can't bear everything anymore and really need help to stop worrying so much over little things and keeping my feelings controlled.   How do you cope with these feelings..?What should and can I say..?",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nlwlsu/boyfriend_is_having_a_really_deep_depression/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nlwlsu/boyfriend_is_having_a_really_deep_depression/

I just need Practical coping tips for panic attacks and intense shame when you’re still living with unsupportive family. If you’ve been through this, how did you find safe people to talk to (friends/teachers/counsellors)? How did you prevent others from normalising your pain?

I’m tired. tired of everything.  things I used to love doing feel more like a chore now.  simple tasks exhaust me.  suicidal thoughts are consuming me. It’s all I think about. death seems peaceful. but I’m too much of a coward to actually kill myself.  the only thing that makes me feel slightly better is hurting myself. the blood comforts me.  yesterday I finally cleaned my room, but that was only because I had an energy drink.  a few hours later, my dad called me down, and demanded to know if I did the litter-boxes the previous day, and he demanded to know if my room was clean.  I had completely forgotten about the litter-boxes, so I told him that I would do it right after I was done doing what I was doing. I also told him that I had just cleaned my room.  he said that my step-mom had already cleaned them. he then threatened to ground me if I didn’t do what I was told the first time around and if my room continued to be “disgusting.”  I’M FUCKING EXHAUSTED.

Like, I felt lonely, I didn't have many friends, I hid myself in the bathroom during lunch breaks in school... But this last two years I kinda broke down. I had already decided when I was 12 that I couldn't enjoy life like the rest, so I should just dedicate my life to do the least amount of damage and the biggest amount of ""good things"". One of the things that I internalized is that I should never tell anyone about my feelings. I kinda had the idea of killing myself in a couple of years, and that telling people about how I felt would just make it worse because I don't want them to worry.     Now things have changed, but still, nobody knows about my problems. I couldn't do the tests to enter university because I got a panic attack and I started to hit myself, so they called an ambulance, but I just said that I was very sick. I wasn't hiding in a bush because I got a panic attack, I was just going through the trees because there was a shortcut... Just to name some of the most terrible things.  Today my cousin came to my house unprompted. I am an avoidant, so I just got a panic attack and hid in a bathroom near my house. Which caused my mom to have a panic attack too because she thought that I was improving. My father managed to make it look like we just went to the city, but they for sure knew something was up... My mom cried so much.  What I want to ask is: Should I tell people about my problem? and, How can I do it?  I would only have to tell this to three of my cousins and my friend, the only four people I ever hang out with. But I don't know how to explain that I have depression, anxiety, OCD, social phobia and cluster C and A personality traits. Like, I wrote a couple of messages that I could send, because I can't bring myself to tell them in person, and I am just going to say depression and anxiety beacuse those are easy to explain.

I explained in detail that I’ve been dealing with long-term bullying, overthinking always,social isolation, not even being able to take a shower, no motivation to do anything, no interest in shopping or going out, and very poor sleep.  The doctor listened and said something like: It’s like your brain is inside a capsule, constantly going to the past and the future, re-living those events as if they’re happening right now, so you can’t really live in the present moment. I can’t give you a clear diagnosis right now, but I can see how fast your brain is working. I want to help normalize that speed and make you feel calmer, so I’ll prescribe you medication.  She prescribed me aripiprazole (Abilify), and that’s the only medication.  Now I’m worried and confused: does this mean she suspects schizophrenia? Or can aripiprazole also be used just for depression/anxiety/trauma?

But I’d cry myself to sleep every night lowkey thinking that was normal.

I’ve been told that this is a sign of depression although I don’t feel depressed but I think it might be a case where I’ve just gotten so used to it that it feels normal to me. I’ve never been suicidal although I’m basically a lowlife who does nothing with himself. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember and it feels like I can’t do anything to change I can’t even enjoy simple pleasures that are meant to be enjoyable like watching tv shows and movies because my attention span is terrible. Even when I try to self-improve I always find myself asking what’s the point because I still don’t fulfill me. I’ve always been scared and anxious in social situations and unable to express myself due to worries I might say the wrong thing or something stupid. I do live a depression-inducing lifestyle though, I have little to no friends, barely leave my house, don’t have anybody to talk to apart from one friend. My hairline started receding at a really young age at around 16/17 this was something I never could’ve predicted as there were no signs of male pattern baldness in my family, my dad probably has a better hairline than me, neither me or my family could make sense of why it was happening so I suspect it was due to stress. Around this time I wasn’t drinking or smoking or doing anything at all to cope with stress until I was about 19 turning 20 then I became a frequent cannabis smoker although not addicted. Never been a relationship and have no desire to be in one, I don’t really see the point personally, I’m also a virgin but recently I’ve come to peace with that knowing that I have genuinely tried my best to court although being a shy and awkward person, just feel like I have bad luck with women. I have no hobbies too aside from going to the gym but it’s not something I’m passionate about. Only good thing going for me right now is recently graduating college but I’m not passionate about my course either. It just feels like there’s something wrong with me like my brain is just really dull and lacks interest in things. I listen to the same 3 songs on repeat everyday, I’m extremely lazy, I don’t like change and tend to do the same thing everyday doing anything else just seems to be too big a mental effort for me. Even when I try to change and cultivate productive habits it just feels forced and wrong, as in not doing it the right way. People don’t respect me, I’m probably a laughing stock to people but I don’t even care anymore. It’s hard to be motivated to succeed with my lifestyle because of the few things I enjoy doing, there is no motivator in my life I don’t have any real aspirations or goals except to eventually buy a house, car etc. pretty basic things like everyone else. I almost feel like extraterrestrial with how different I am to everyone else like I just wasn’t made for this world. Luckily, I can at least sympathise with myself and not push all the blame on me as I honestly feel like if I lived twice it would all be the same it’s like this was the life that was destined for me.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmbomc/i_dont_enjoy_doing_anything/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmbomc/i_dont_enjoy_doing_anything/

Self inflicted loneliness because alot of the time I feel I’m my worst enemy, I think people see me as a worthless joke to be around or interact with but maybe that is true because I know I’m physically repulsive. Anyway, I’ve literally hid myself away in my bedroom for over 8 years with the idea of making myself beautiful by a certain date finally being the key to my happiness. I used to plan what I would do, how I would act, what I would say etc. I’ve been utterly obsessive about it my whole life so I’ve never appreciated who I am, only who I soon hope to be. Anyway, I’m 20 now. I’m just at my first day at uni. Years ago I had obviously plans to be beautiful by this point which as a result would allow me to be happy, have friends and finally live happy. Instead I’m a repulsive ugly joke who can’t interact with people and deserves nothing.  I’ve been tired for a while but I’m for real starting to want to just end it to escape my life and my sadness.

She belittled me and said I wasn’t a man I was a cowardly little bitch and that I’m just ego bruised and jealous. As well as a bunch of other things. I dropped our daughter off later that day and it was super awkward. I told her I didn’t appreciate the insults and she just kinda looked at me and said can I have my daughter now?. So I gave her to her mom then my daughter started crying and calling for me so I grabbed her and gave her a big hug and kiss and left. I cried pretty much the whole way home. Then a few days later she sends me pics of our daughter and sent me another one last night of our daughter laying in her bed. I got really sad thinking I can’t be there anymore in that bed with them. I’ve been a mess an anxious for the past 2 weeks over this new relationship. Been miserable for the last 2 years. Last time I was happy was a month ago when we took our daughter to the zoo together.

I don't really have anyone to talk to, so here goes:  This has truly been the worst year of my life. I've struggled with generalized anxiety disorder and depression for most of my life. I'm 43/f. I think I've been depressed since I was born. It's terrible.  So my mother's health has declined quite a bit. I work full time and I take care of her the best I can (she has an aide when I am at work, for which I am very grateful). She's on oxygen therapy, has limited mobility, etc. she requires a lot, and honestly, has probably gotten used to me taking care of her. I'm tired! I work full time and I am exhausted. I have a sister that also lives with me who is completely unhelpful with my mother. We don't get along, and she's a big source of my anxiety and depression. She knows I struggle and doesn't do much to make my life even a little easier. I take my mom to Drs appointments (when I have days off of work), help her with her CPAP at night, make sure she eats before I go to work, constantly clean up everyones messes. I'm so sick of it!!! My life is at a stand still. And I am angry at everyone! My family just gaslights me, and they make it seem like I am the problem.   I'm so sad all the time. all I do is cry. I feel truly hopeless. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Everyday I wake up, I wonder, what's next? At work I am a mess, constantly worried about her. When I'm home, I dread what I will be dealing with when I get there.   I had a therapist, but the cost because too much for me.   I'm just so sad.

He's been on 10g of Lexapro and 75mg of Wellbutrin for a little over a year (Wellbutrin) and 5 years (lexapro).  After living together 10 years, he recently moved 7 hrs away to complete a 2 year Masters' degree.  Ever since Spring (when he started to prepare to leave) his mood swings have been *devastatingly* intense. Intense depression, intense rage, with brief periods of clarity between. It's been awful and exhausting for both of us. It makes arguments terrible because he's on such a short fuse and struggles with defensiveness, then he feels intensely depressed after. I'm exhausting carrying it all.  He's been in therapy for months with someone he really likes and trusts, tries to exercise regularly, eats pretty well, no screens before bed etc and still it's been bad. He's been away for 3 weeks and counting.   My question is: does this seem like time to reassess his medication / dosage? We are not sure if it's just the life transition he's going through or not. He likes the Lexapro, but has been contemplating raising the dose and/or quitting the Wellbutrin.  He used to be on Buspirone, but together with the Lexapro he was too down/depressed, the weight gain and sweating were awful etc.   Just looking for some perspective on this from deep in the weeds.

1nmllhj,1758439622,2025-09-21T07:27:02Z,offmychest,"I was the ""girl who fell in love with her psychiatrist"", 9 years ago.","Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. Very few people know this about me.  I was 19 years old, freshly out of my parents' place and into the world, living with my partner at the time.  I was heavily traumatized due to a life spent in an abusive family, and I didn't know how to deal with emotions. I had started to medicate with alcohol and weed, but I was struggling, and several terrible events made me ask my partner if I could see their psychiatrist. At the time, I was falling head first into spiritual beliefs about reincarnation, soul mates, guardian angels, and was convinced I could talk to spirits, see auras, and had visions of past lives. My partner was into all that too. This is important for later.  So I started to see their psychiatrist. It was my first time seeing one. I had sessions with a shitty therapist a few times when I was a teenager,  but never a psychiatrist. And I had a big, big crush on him. I don't really know when I started to feel like we were ""connected"", what was the trigger, but it happened. I started to feel like he was ""following"" me home, not with his physical body, but with his spiritual one. I thought that he did it to see if I was safe. But later, I started to feel like his spiritual body was always there with me. When I slept. When I woke up. When I showered. When I had sex with my partner. But I kept going to our sessions. Trying to find pieces of proof, trying to subtly imply things, make his mask show cracks that what was happening in my head was happening in reality. I told him about my first time, it was rape. I was convinced he was getting off of it.  I also told almost everything to my partner, and they BELIEVED ME. Because it was beliefs we shared. And yet, we kept on seeing this doctor, because we wanted to bust him.  This girl who went viral, I went through the SAME beliefs: thinking he was doing a ""hot/cold"" treatment to get me addicted to him, convinced he didn't say anything explicitly because it would be unprofessional and he didn't want to risk his job, everything. I never contacted him off session though, and ChatGPT bullshit wasn't a thing back then, thank fucking God.  I was slipping off mentally. I was sure I knew what his house looked like, because I was convinced I saw it in a dream. That I could feel what he felt, what were his feelings, that he was thelepatically harassing me to become his slave, and that once he would think I was ""ripe"", he would abduct me. I remember one night like a fever dream, when I jolted awake after a nightmare, and spent the rest of the night ""fighting"" with him in my mind. I told my partner in the morning that he had hired a chaman to strengthen his soul power, but I had won the fight. They were fucking PROUD OF ME.  I spent an entire Sunday compulsively checking the mailbox, because I could sense that it was THE day, the day he was going to slip in a letter, asking me to go away with him.  Guess what: it didn't happen.  I stopped seeing him eventually, and my partner did too.  I never got the help I desperately needed, and I felt my psychic intimacy violated for the two years that followed. When I came to my senses, and told my partner it was all a delusion, they lashed out at me, saying that I ruined their therapy with my bullshit.  I don't blame them. But I was absolutely not in the right state of mind to snap out of it. I was in psychosis, and they enabled it.  When I saw the recaps about this girl, it gave me nausea.   I hope that she's able to get real help soon. I didn't and it haunted me day and night for years, draining my soul, and made me fall deeper into addictions to cope.  I really wish her the best. Her being treated like a freak and a laughing stock is the worse. She's a stalker, she's a terrible person, but what she needs right now is urgent psychiatric care.  Believe me.

I won't eat for a couple days at a time because I refuse to go to the store or cook. I use to enjoy getting a lil drunk every once in a while, but I don't even want to drink a full cocktail. Didn't want to deal with my hair anymore so I cut it off. I don't hang out with anyone because it's to much effort. I can't sleep so I just sit up for hours on end feeling shitty about not doing anything. I don't go out anymore because it requires getting ready and I live in pajamas because picking out an outfit is just to hard. I don't have any hobbies. I can't even focus on a TV show long enough to know what's going on, let alone care enough to pay attention. I have not been able to read a whole book since 9th grade.

My mental health is so awful, I told her that I needed therapy and she would deny it and say that I needed more outing time even tho its really serious.. she even woke me up in the morning one time because of her yelling and her anger for no reason.

She is the main cause of my anger issues and sometimes she would even tell me to do su\*cide when I did something wrong, one time when I wanted to wash my cup at the kitchen while shes in SHE SLAMMED HER METAL POT AND IT WAS ON PURPOSE, SHE DID IT BECAUSE SHE WAS ANGRY AND I ALMOST WENT DEAF BECAUSE ON HOW LOUD IT IS. what if I actually went deaf?

Mentally I sometimes had little flashes of actually feeling alive, then they’d fade. After the first days, the side effects calmed down a lot. I also noticed some positives like actually wanting to get out of bed, do my tasks, and be a bit more productive. Even the depressive episodes felt a little less intense than before.  My GP decided to bump me to 150mg because I was getting really bad emotional numbness, dark thoughts, and on/off depressive & anxiety episodes.  Now I’m on day 9 of 150mg:  Day 1 honestly felt amazing no real side effects, actually better than when I first started 50 or 100. BUT after that my mood dropped and things got weird. So what’s going on now:  I feel more detached from reality (like stronger dissociation).  At the same time social interactions feel easier, I’m more resilient emotionally.  Appetite basically gone, BARELY eating.  Can’t focus for long, I unintentionally ignore very important stuff.  Lots of zoning out/daydreaming.  Sleep is messy, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes I oversleep during the day, and other times I’ll sleep just 2 hours then wake up feeling “full” like I don’t need more sleep.  Has anyone else had this happen after moving to 150? Is this normal for the first days only ? Did it get better after a couple weeks? Would love to hear if anyone pushed through and felt normal again especially with the dissociation and harming thoughts stuff. I would like to hear your experiences.  Note: I’m on Apo-Sertraline, not the one by Pfizer. Not sure if that makes a difference, but just wanted to mention it.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmmsmt/9_days_on_150_mg_is_this_normal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmmsmt/9_days_on_150_mg_is_this_normal/
1nmn554,1758445432,2025-09-21T09:03:52Z,depression,What's the point on moving forward anymore,"Hello, I am a guy in his 20s and I feel like today's the breaking point of me. I have questioned whether or not the path to my future is even worth it at this point, despite it's rewards and whatever.  I am known as a ""third culture kid."" Which meant that I didn't really stay in one location/country at any point during my important part of my childhood, sure there are moments where I had around probably two to five years of staying stationary in one location, but most of the time, I had to move. The locations are either from the Middle East, Asia, and North America. For now though it seems like I'm staying in one country for now. But the damage was already done. I don't feel ""belong"" anywhere, despite living in a country where it considers immigrants as one of them, no matter what they came from. But I believe despite that, it's still important to at least understand or assimilate to the culture that's around them, even as something as simple as a small talk.  I struggle to understand why people act the way they do around here, I got no problems with them being that way but I don't get it. I can't really describe it but that's what I think. But it makes me feel more isolated than before.  I don't get their sports, workplace culture, excessive consumerism, erratic driving, the drive to network so much instead of forming real friendships, plastic friendships, toxic positivity, and more that I can't think at the top of my head.  The problem is I already know how to solve such a isolating case that I have, it's just I don't have the motivation to do it. So instead I just play some video games that I get burnt out of overtime just to distract myself. Of course I enjoy playing them it's just that I'm afraid of trying new games or things because it might waste my time. I compared this to the drive I had back when I was making content on Youtube. I remember that burning passion I had compiling videos, inserting sound effects, etc. That's all on iMovie but I made it work. I don't have such passion on drawing or even writing stories, in fact it just makes me pissed that I am not good enough. I don't have the same passion on video editing anymore because I want to create something rather than just edit things or something.  Because of being a third culture kid, I suck at English and even the language of a country I was born at, the best I could in my original language is a basic conversational one, anything from writing an essay or something like that is a fever dream. Even if I had the means to come back to my country, I'd feel even more isolated since I don't get their collectivist culture of being in a group so much or fitting in. It's not so flexible as to like in the country I am living right now that at least you can be whatever you want to be, but it pushes that to the extreme almost, like tying your own boot straps kind of thing, what happens if you don't have any boot straps or boots at all?  I am shit at my original language and shit at english? That's perfect, I can't even make a good original story without some bs grammatical issues or trying to describe something since I'd much rather show something or like draw it, visualize it to a reader than describing it since I am shit at english.  I do have friends but the only problem is that one whom I consider my best friend is in another state, my other friends are in another city, the easiest solution here you might say is just to drive them and meet them. But then I realized is that I hated driving.  Driving basically showed my anxieties towards the road, people, and my personal safety. I can't fathom driving every single day in a congested freeway just to live to work while other people see the traffic on the freeway as another Tuesday morning. I had to drive to a freeway after three years of not doing it and oh boy I still wonder why I'm still alive to this day. But the problem is that I need to drive, my state is designed in a way that I need a car to go around. Even though my state has some trains around it, it takes so much planning like factoring transfer times, buses, uber, etc.  Why getting around requires a machine that is tens of thousands of dollars that I don't have? Plus, it's really stressful for other cars to expect me to drive 20 above the speed limit and tailgating me like I'm the bad person who is driving already 5 above the speed limit. What do you want me to do??  This also showed how much of a sensitive fuck I am. Getting a beep while driving, oops now I gotta think about my mistake on that specific moment for the rest of the day or even week, accidentally making a mistake on a experiment during class? Haha it's my fault, I should've just predicted that would've happened in the first place instead of making such mistake. I wished I was not a sensitive person everyday, I always get jealous of people just cruising by despite hell all over and able to just laugh or forget about it the moment it happened. I want that. I don't want to feel, it just hurts me, I don't want to make the group happy before myself. But I did anyway because I'll come off as mean or self-serving ahole. I want to be someone who wishes to be indifferent in everything, because it seems like it's working to other people. It's hard to be a sensitive man in a cruel world. Despite how cringe it sounds.  Finishing your prereqs for nursing school also adds in its fair share of bs. What do you mean it's a point based system? I have never even heard of the world ""impacted"" on a major. In the country I was born into, it was a straight forward process, you didn't need to go to a CNA or LVN or go get another certificate in order to get into nursing school, you'd just have to apply I believe, do some tests, and the same prereqs. I'm so stressed on whether or not I'll be going into nursing school, sure it'll be possible if I did good on my classes, but I am not, I was a A student at high school, but forgot to have a proper study habits during my college classes. I'm still struggling to this day.  Also even when everything is done, what's the point afterwards? I am a guy that usually plans way more ahead than necessary, but it's ironic that I have no plans right after I got my nursing degree if I ever get it. I don't even know where I'll retire. Even if that's all done what's the point? Get a wife? Raise kids? And then die? How about I end it all right now? I am not brave enough to pursue new hobbies and stories even though it's been playing on my mind ever since. I am a guy that doesn't even fit in a country that desires everyone to be an individual. It's ironic. Why should have the right to exists when I don't fit in? Is it just logical to end it all so that the group doesn't pity me anymore?  I believe that moving to so many places made me an introvert. It's so tiring just to try and make new friends or something, or saying the wrong words or phrases that I ended up just not saying anything, especially during an outing like going on a mall or something. I get pissed as to even saying a word or a mumble because there's no point anymore. That's probably why I suck at speaking English.  I remember one time when I was a kid where I fell on something high up and when my friends were trying to help me get to the nurse's office, everything turned bright white, my surroundings, basically everywhere. I could barely hear my friend's voice right next me. But the thing that I remember is that it was so peaceful, I couldn't care less if they left me there to rot when I fell, sure it was painful that I couldn't move after that fall, but during my walk to the nurses office, it was so peaceful. I can't get a moment like that in my life, the closest experience I have is probably sleeping. Maybe if I found a peaceful and painless way to end it all, maybe I could experience such thing again.  This all adds up. All these unsolved issues adds up to me. Every single day I wake up knowing that these issues would probably not be solved for good and I'll have to just suck it up. I did suck it up every day, I did. I fucking did. I still wonder how I am able to attend lectures, go to work, church, play games, ADLS, and driving without going to a mental breakdown. I'm surprised honestly.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmn554/whats_the_point_on_moving_forward_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmn554/whats_the_point_on_moving_forward_anymore/

Ive talked to probably only 2 people ( my bestest friends) about it, and i just cant seem to process.  Ive been dating my girlfriend for about 3 years now. We're a lesbian couple. Shes about 2 yrs older than i am, and got to experience a lot more in life- sex, relationships, moves, etc. I havent. I was pretty much fresh out of high school when we met and we were a very slow burn into situationship into relationship. During our situationship she was having intercourse with someone else, and i was just going on multiple dates with people that never went anywhere. We became so quickly attached and attracted to each other but we were both at such a terrible and unhealthy time in our own lives that made it hard to ever communicate and set boundaries with each other. But during that time she was just as equally vulnerable and falling for me, telling me she only wants me yet never seemed to get out of her other situation.  After a few months of that, we started dating because we realized we couldn't be without each other.   Also im so sorry if this is all terribly vague and doesnt have too many details, i just dont want anyone i know irl to find this because i have terrible OCD and this is something that has increasingly ruined my already awful mental health.  But anyways we fell in love asap, but during our relationship i havent been able to tame my jealousy and feelings of being betrayed? And she had to keep in contact for a few months while we're dating because she had to leave something of very high value in their property until she found somewhere to move it. But yeah. And she always lied anytime that person would try to message her.  I dontknow why this has affected me so much and made me feel like this was infidelity, like, could that even count since we weren't official? I dont know but its caused so much drift and damage between us because of my breakdowns. I dont want to hold anything against her but there was so much that happened during that period that hurt me. I try to ask her about details, that maybe could try to help ease the pain but her memory is extremely terrible and shes never able to recall anything. Our relationship has had its very toxic moments and we even had to split for a few months, but ive never been able to feel at ease with the thought of not having her in my life. I just feel like something about our past and dynamic was very unfair, and i dont know if anything i try to help the pain will ever actually make it hurt less. And i dont think leavingher would be a solution itself but i dont know how mych longer i can keep ruminating about this. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Im just lost.

How do I handle this?,"I’m 18F and my mom just found out I had sex before I turned 18. Now she wants me to tell my dad and I don’t know how.  For context: a few months before turning 18, I had my first time with my boyfriend. We used a condom, but it broke. I freaked out, but my bf immediately took responsibility and got emergency contraception. After that, we decided not to do it again, and we haven’t.  My mom recently found my old birth control pack (in which i thought i already got rid off since i threw the box already which was very unlucky), and she was really upset. She told me she felt very hurt, that I broke her trust, and she’s angry that I did it so young. Her whole view is that having sex young “ruins” my purity and value, while my mindset is different, I felt like at my age, I had the freedom to try things as long as I knew the risks and consequences, which I did. It just went wrong that one time.  The worst part is she accused my bf of maybe forcing me, which isn’t true at all. It was 100% consensual. She doesn’t really know him and made a lot of assumptions.  Now she wants me to tell my dad. He’s working abroad (in the US), so I’d either have to call him or message him. I’m scared because he really trusted me, even let me have a bf, and I don’t want to feel like I broke all that trust. Okay maybe i already did but I dont know how he will react. Mom said he might even make me stop studying if he knows, which made me even more anxious on telling him since im studying for medicine soon and im a pretty good student. I just want him to understand that I’m still the same daughter, that one choice doesn’t define me, and that I’ve learned from this.   TL;DR: Mom found out I had sex before turning 18. She felt hurt and betrayed, says it ruined my “purity,” and wants me to tell my dad (who’s abroad). I’m scared he’ll be disappointed. It was consensual, we used protection but it failed, and we haven’t done it again. How do I tell him and rebuild trust with my parents when our views about sex are so different?",0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmoo7c/my_mom_thinks_i_ruined_my_purity_and_wants_me_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmoo7c/my_mom_thinks_i_ruined_my_purity_and_wants_me_to/

He’s very kind, and he’s been extremely patient with me. It’s not anything he’s done wrong but, but i am someone who takes a moment to figure out how i truly feel about someone. We met on a dating app actually right before i deleted the dating app because i decided they weren’t for me. Dating apps weren’t feeling organic enough for me. I talked to my family and friends about him and even my therapist. Everyone is telling me that i don’t have to have an answer on what i’m feeling for him, because that stuff takes time for some people and that’s valid. However, i can clearly see this man falling for me. and if I’m being honest, my anxiety is getting in the way of everything. I’m terrified if leading him on and i already think i am. He’s fun to spend time with, but we have some compatibility differences as it pertains to interest. I’m very heavily in the gym and he has no interest in it. My life revolves around interments and music, it’s my biggest interest. As stupid as it sounds, he likes music, but doesn’t center it like me. He been over my house 3 or 4 times and we just lay in bed or kiss… i hate laying in bed. He also has interests in camping, hunting, and a lot of outdoor stuff. Tbh, i’m kind of a princess, and I have 0 interest in anything outdoorsy besides hiking. I feel guilty about that aswell, i feel like those are very important things in your life when that’s a big hobby of yours and i feel like he deserves someone who’s more interested in that possibly. My anxiety is making me look at all these “cons” and not the pros. Because of that, it’s making it hard to fall for him. the problem is i’m watching him fall for me in real time.   I know the right answer is to call it quits but i don’t know how. I’m feeing super guilty and it’s been eating at me for 3 days. He’s been so kind, i’m just realizing i’m not as ready for something as I thought i was. It’s also bothering me because my productivity has felt so low…. My issue is i don’t have therapy for two weeks due to me and my therapist’s schedule, and i feel so so guilty. Last time we saw each other we were also intimate and though it has nothing to do with that i feel even more guilty that I’m calling quits after we have done smth like that. even worse, I’m like 98% sure hes working on a birthday gift for me.

1nmrbzq,1758459616,2025-09-21T13:00:16Z,offmychest,Being bodyshamed by adults as a child,"I don't like to talk about weight and body image with my friends. I don't know if it can be a trigger to them and so on. But this has been bugging me for years. So I just felt like sharing it with someone. I'm currently 31 y.o., so I grew up during the age of skinny celebs and horrible diet trends. That left some scars. I'm healthy now and have gone to therapy, but I still ruminate about that time of my life.  I remember one instance when I was like 10 years old. I was staying over at a friends house over the weekend. During the evening on saturday the mom gave us icecream. She portioned out the first serving so we both got the same amount. Her daughter asked for seconds and she got a HUGE serving size. I remember thinking that was odd. I asked if I could get a scoop as well, ""but not as much as x"" because I didn't want to waste food if I couldn't eat it all. Her mother said no and I asked if the container was empty. She repeated herself - no. And then she just looked me up and down and stared long and hard at my tummy. You know, the ""you could afford to lose weight"" look. I got the message. The SHAME I felt in that moment... the irony is that her daughter was the same size as me. Go figure. I was in tears when my mom picked me up the next day.  And another moment that stuck with me was when I was hanging out with a friend from school. I was fifteen. My friend was flat as a board and I was well developed, to use those words. We had baked a cake and it was in the fridge. She asked if I could fetch us a slice each so I did. Her dad was in the kitchen and I told him I was going to get us cake. I didn't want to be rude and just rummage through his fridge and cupboards for no reason. I even asked if I could serve him one, but he declined. When I opened the fridge he came up behind me and slammed it closed. I hurt a couple of fingers in the process and was so stunned I cursed. He just went all ""you don't need more cake, you're too big"" while I stood there clutching my hand. I told my friend and she lost her shit, especially since I was the one who paid for all of the ingredients. The guy was an asshole and his wife had shared with both me and her daughter that she wanted a divorce (after half a bottle of wine). But it's laughable that he took some anger out on me by fatshaming a teenager.  I was also an equestrian when I was younger and those clothes are notorious for running small (at least back then?). I remember struggling to get a pair of pants over my ass. I asked the sales clerk if she had brands with more stretch. She flat out told me that I should lose a couple of pounds. I was so close to bursting out into tears. I was thirteen/fourteen and felt fat just because my butt was big compared to my waist. I was FIT back then, so I was pretty much fatshamed for genetics and body composition.  My mom entered the store after doing another errand. The sales clerk looked like she was going to have a stroke when she realized I wasn't shopping all by myself.  I contemplated telling my mom, but she would have gone full Karen on her in the middle of the store, so I just kept my mouth shut. I never entered that store again.   I could go on and on with similar stories, but these stuck out to me.   It was bad enough to get that treatment from other kids, but grown ups should know better. I went back and forth with anorexia/binge/purge during my late teens and early twenties. While I can't blame it all on these examples, it certainly didn't help. Not to mention how often I was sexualized for being an early bloomer. Having the body of a woman when you're still a child was traumatizing.   Growing up during the height of diet culture was a wild ride. I can't decide if it's laughable or sad. I feel attractive in my current body. But if I looked like this twenty years ago I would most likely feel like a failure on a daily basis. The fact that body size and pursued health can be dictated by trends is insane.  Anyone else who feel like sharing similar horror stories?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmrbzq/being_bodyshamed_by_adults_as_a_child/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmrbzq/being_bodyshamed_by_adults_as_a_child/

I wait 12 month and in June 2024 I see 2 female psychiatrist’s. I walk in the room sit down, I ask had they read my notes which they admit they hadn’t. They ask bluntly “what is it you want” I explain I have severe cptsd and I’m not coping and would like to try meds. They say “we see your being released in 3 week so we can’t help you, ask your GP to refer you in the community”. I leave the room 3 - 4 minutes after entering. So I’m out and my doctor tried to refer me to psychiatry and I’m refused “because I was assessed in June and no signs of mental illness”. I wasn’t even asked any questions by these 2 psychiatrists who apparently “assessed” me and they hadn’t read my notes. I wasn’t assesed. I’m beyond angry I’m now essentially being denied help because these 2 woman lied. This is my typical experience with the NHS mental health services in general. Are my rights being breached ?

Now I am reaching 26, and for the first time since then, a considerable amount of people do not know I am gay. Historically, I have made my sexuality apparent within maybe a week of getting to know people. I date a lot so I often have a story to tell about it, I am not exactly masculine in almost any way, and most relevantly, most of my life and the stuff I engage in is queer as hell.  However, I moved very far away from where I lived all my life. I wanted a fresh start, and while this wasn’t my main step in doing so, I’ve chosen not to tell people I am gay. My coworkers know I date a lot, they take interest in my dating life, but I do not specify gender. I don’t correct them when they ask if I “have a girl.” It’s mostly lying by omission — which I know in this case could just be viewed as keeping that part of my life private. Could be viewed like that, but I know it’s mostly out of being afraid I’ll be treated differently. Even something as minor as no longer being asked about my dating life, but worse, my job is one of the most gossipy environments I’ve ever witnessed. It’s also incredibly tough; most of my coworkers are ex military. They’re all a bunch of heterosexual men but they chat like Disney channel teenage girls. I don’t like the idea of even the slightest comment of my sexual orientation being something they’d needle at. They would not treat me poorly but many I know would be a little offput by this. I’ve dropped little hints that probably people my age would get are signs that I am not straight, but most people at work are much older than I. They’re great people, I don’t want to trouble the waters.  What set me over the edge, what’s got me so frustrated is that Friday, I stopped myself from ACTIVELY lying. I almost claimed I was going on a date with a woman. I was not. I am a part of a big social sports league, and I pretended like I didn’t remember the name of the league when asked (also on Friday) because it’s actually incredibly queer. I know that being more private about this, especially considering my environment, is rational. However, the younger form of me was so much braver. He believed that it was my responsibility to be open, to represent however minorly that we are everywhere. Now, I get anxious even wearing something gay at the grocery store.

So maybe sometimes I meet 1 person other than family members. I really love them and I am happy to have them as my friends, but other than them, I basically have no connections. In school, I dont talk to people. I have no school friends. So I dont go to parties. I just dont have anything in common with them except school things. They talk about boys and girls, or video games I never played, or they just talk nonsense in that weird tiktok language I dont understand fully. I read fantasy books, and sometimes horror. Few people seem to be interested in that. This is the topic I can actually talk about with some people. Sometimes. I watched Doctor Who, and basically all episodes in existence(only the 2005- series). I asked everyone of they watched itt but nobody. The best answers I get are ""I think I heard about it"". Why are there no people who like it in my county? Then there is the fact that I have anxiety. I drink herbal teas to quiet it down. It works very good, and because of that, I know a few things about herbs and I am interested in trying new combinations and new herbs that might give me peace. When I talk about the different teas and how they affect the brain and the body I look like some weird drug addict. Maybe I am. I dont really know at this point. These teas keep me from having anxiety attacks every fucking day. I like talking about drugs. I dont take any drugs, but I find them interesting, because they change our perception and our perception of the world is our reality. But again, I cant talk about the without sounding like a drug addict. Of course its not the whole list. Just the past few months'. I dont think these interest are so strange. There has to be someone who likes the same things as me. Maybe it is that I am very introverted and I naturally talk less then others. Or that im quiet.  You know... I probably sound like someone who doesnt have any problems and just wants to unnecessarily cry about things. But I really am tired, believe me. I live in my head and I dont know how to get out. I have no motivation, I have no real goals, I just say I want to go to university to make myself forget it. I go to the best school in my region, but I did nothing to get in. I am a bit depressed... I know that people need to talk to other people to be healthy. I want to talk to other people but I dont want to talk to anybody. I want the weird ones. Why are there so few? I feel selfish. The only thing keeping ne sane is my 2 friends. Sometimes I think I am using them to not feel bad. And itt makes me feel worse. I am most likely very selfish. This post came to be because I just drank 5 coffees. It probably doesnt make any sense, because my brain went trough a few different thought processes.

While I was there, the teacher I was talking to asked me about my summer, what my favourite part was, etc. I told him I went to a really good music festival. He asked me what my favourite act was – I said there were so many I couldn't even pick. He asked me again, to which I replied that there were almost too many amazing options – and then everyone in the room started laughing? Like, really, really laughing. And not in a way where they were laughing because I said something funny; they were all laughing at me together. I don't really get what was so funny about what I said. there were about 7-8 of them in this office. Then they started talking to each other about what I'd said – I couldn't really understand what they were saying, but one guy said something about me and then they all laughed again, I heard them say my name and then I think something about me being dumb? Once they all calmed down the teacher helped me book the equipment. As I left he said, 'see you on friday - and maybe by then you'll be able to think of an answer' and then they all started laughing again. It felt like they all had some kind of inside joke about me.   To be honest, I brushed this off because it didn't feel like abnormal behaviour to me. I feel like anytime I talk to adults (and I use the word adults just to say people older than me, or in a position of seniority over me) I get laughed at or talked down to - or receive a 'righhhhhhhtttttt' after everything I say. Then I started to think about it. I thought back to a group feedback session with tutors that week, why was I the only one getting critiqued that harshly, or had all of those questions? Then I think about people at work, how come I'm the only one who gets made fun of by the head of department? I got home that evening and started balling. Like really balling. I've always brushed off this thought in my mind of 'everyones looking at me and thinking I'm weird' - 'everyone in here thinks I'm annoying', because its just sensitivity to social anxiety. I always worry I say the wrong thing when I barely say anything at all. But when I started to think about all these experiences that I experience on a daily - conversations I can quote, it really became apparent that this is a real thing that happens. Not everyone is scared of talking to adults, thats not something everything goes through. I never feel comfortable to speak to these people because I just know something negative is coming my way, and it always does. I just don't know what it is about me that invites this in ? I always know, If I enter a conversation with adults and talk, its a matter of seconds before someone makes a patronising comment and they all laugh. I thought that maybe I'm not being confident enough in myself, so I try to be confident in my own decisions and thoughts, but its almost like that makes it worse?   I've never said this outloud to anyone. This is the first time I've ever verablised this feeling and its actually made me think theres more to it. I just don't know whats wrong with me.

1nmuk81,1758467606,2025-09-21T15:13:26Z,offmychest,My love life story: why I gave up on dating and love😌,"Recently, I’ve been getting notifications about dating stories, and some posts really caught my attention. So I thought...why not share my story? My love life (which I’ve basically given up on) might not be exciting, but it’s real.  Before anyone judges, let me say this upfront: I know I need therapy. I just can’t afford it right now.  I come from a Muslim neighborhood where dating and hooking up are considered taboo. So I never had a relationship, since I was busy studying hard to get into a decent university and build a solid future for myself......until I got married.(Something like an arranged marriage) It was a mistake. A toxic one.   I put everything I had into getting divorced, and if you know anything about Muslim countries, you know that process can take forever. Mine took over two years.  Since then, I’ve been focusing on work and family. I want to grow, become independent, and eventually move out.   And here’s the thing: I’ve realized relationships might not be for me. Or I might not be for relationships 😅  At first, I was like: “NOPE. No marriage. Not doing that again.”   But after a while, I decided to give men a chance (no offense).   I tried dating apps. Talked to some foreigners—they were actually nice. Maybe genuinely nice, maybe just pretending.   Still, I got bored and deleted the apps within a week or two.   Especially when I tried “fishing in the sea of my own country”…   Let’s just say: disaster.   Most of the men only wanted to hook up. A few wanted marriage—which I don’t.   And almost all of them were… well, messed up. Bad habits, bad attitudes, bad jobs.  Even when I found someone who seemed decent, I realized I’m not the one. He was way too clingy, and I was already overwhelmed, trying to support my family and manage my job.   When I finally decided to accept him as my boyfriend, my body literally reacted. I felt sick.   I apologized and told him I couldn’t continue, but he got mad and said, “You’re just like the others! Everyone keeps turning me down…”  😐ʘ⁠‿⁠ʘ  So here’s why I don’t want marriage or dating anymore:  - Most couples I know are unhappy (because of the man)   - Marriage feels like a prison for women   - My father doesn’t respect my mom, and my ex didn’t respect me either—I know this cycle would repeat   - Nobody seems honest. Everyone’s playing games   - I’m not saying “I’m a strong independent woman,” but I don’t have that soft, romantic energy   - I can’t find anyone who matches my standards (seriously, where are they hiding?)   - I’m tired of pretending, explaining, and performing emotional labor just to be “lovable”  Now I’m stuck trying to explain all this to my family and convince them to let me live my own life. I feel like my parents have planted my feet in wet and yet they keep shouting: “go! You can do it!”   Feel free to share your opinions 🌹",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmuk81/my_love_life_story_why_i_gave_up_on_dating_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmuk81/my_love_life_story_why_i_gave_up_on_dating_and/
1nmv5mm,1758469038,2025-09-21T15:37:18Z,depression,Problems I faced,"1. Ageing Anxiety: I worry that I missed out on the good things during my childhood, such as being in a more comfortable environment where I’m not bossed around or told heavy things, having a phone, feeling free, playing the games I should’ve played, such as Fire Emblem: Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates, Hyrule Warriors. During high school, I didn't make many friends. Nor with anyone. I just spent my high school days alone. And at the start of middle school or elementary, for that matter, K12 would’ve been a relaxing learning experience. I tried K12 in 8th grade, but there are still so many things I should’ve done. I could’ve entered the Pokémon VGC or TGC tournaments when I was younger, too. But I never gave myself the chance. I also could’ve just paid better attention and had better knowledge if I applied myself better. If I weren’t so dumb. I could’ve even had a significant other. Whenever I got in trouble I was spanked. Should’ve told the teacher or any adult to call child services.    1. My past: I did not choose how I wanted to spend my youth. I just had a rough time with my family. When I was little, I was subjected to abuse even if I had done something bad: shot with a BB gun, whipped with belts, gaslighted, told to stop crying, verbally abused, and yelled at. I hated being told sexist things growing up, such as “boys are not supposed to be scared of bugs,” and “Quit crying! Girls cry!”. I just hate being alive because of my past. My dad isn’t all that better to me now just because he stopped hitting me with a belt. Whenever I get depressed or upset, he minimizes my pain. Telling me what he needs from me. “We don’t need you to be depressed. We need you to be happy.” and things like “Quit being depressed, man! You know who deserves to be depressed? Homeless people. You 've got food and shelter!”. And at 12 years old, when I had a knee injury from falling off my scooter, I was upset about it. And my mom tells me, “You’re such a baby! You weren’t injured!” And at one point during my childhood, I said I don’t like sports, and she said, “You’d better toughen up, boy and not be a sissy!” There are lots of moments in the past that traumatize me now as an adult! I hated being a guy because of this treatment. I still hate being one!! I was always disrespected and criticized for being sensitive. I wish I was never brought into a cruel world. That’s why gendered nicknames like “dude” or “man” actually rub me the wrong way. 2. I can’t sleep: I miss being able to sleep well when I was younger. I used to sleep from 9 to 6-8. Now I usually have horrible sleep nowadays. I now sleep at 11 or 12 and could have 7 hours of sleep at most. Unfortunately, sleep quality changes as we physically get older. I hate this fact. 3. Social Anxiety: I start to lose interest interacting with others. I hate being out there with even a few people. Strangers can be overly casual or rude. They might even make me uncomfortable with their profanity and stuff. I’ve dealt with classmates who get cocky with me and a bunch of people misunderstand me. I can’t stand anyone because no one sees the real me. 4. Issues with the world: Treatment of males: whenever they are upset, they almost get no sympathy from other males. They are stupidly expected to be loud, energetic, bulky, carry heavy stuff, be analytical, get bossed around, their emotional or physical pain not being a big deal to others, do things themselves, and not be treated like they are precious. treated roughly, get stronger by suffering. They even have to wear boring suits. They have no freedom to express themselves when they want to without being constrained or criticized.                   Whilst females have kindness, someone to talk to, great social skills, be treated with respect and delicacy, not be bossed around by males as much as males, never have to go through as much physical pain as males, treated like royalty, expected to be weaker than males, cry more easily, are more gentle, are more academically successful, love cute things, are more good at opening up, they can wear anything they want more than men. It’s not just pants and shorts they can wear, it’s dresses and makeup. They are treated with more respect than males. And that’s not all the problems with the world. Everything costs money. Even basic human needs such as therapy, a home, and the competition make everything almost unaffordable. People work extra hard for a large amount of income in jobs they don’t like. Boring office jobs, lame part-time jobs. And since everything is competitive and expensive, getting a job is unnecessarily hard. I was not ready for a cruel world like this. I wanted to live independently. Not follow orders and demands. We also have to put up with a harsh family environment. It’s where most of them are not at all understanding. And my father is just overbearing. They may care about us. But they are not always considerate.  5. Busyness: Everyone is busy. That’s it. I’m always alone, and no one worthy of my time has time for me. I hate that people have to work to live. This societal system is colorless and cruel. People should be allowed to live wherever they want, especially when they are struggling. But others on my end are too busy to waste their time on me. I feel trapped in a system and a Christian family that was never made for me. I just wanted to live freely with no one making me feel alone. Everyone is always busy. Another reason I hate being an adult so much! I feel oppressed and alone all the time, and I can’t even find a job myself! There are too many options and steps!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmv5mm/problems_i_faced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmv5mm/problems_i_faced/

It feels absolutely... brutal. I though getting dumped was way worse, but it might only be slightly worse. At least that's it, that's the end of it and nothing you can do. The grief is almost as if someone has died.  Our relationship wasn't toxic, but it was barely ""good enough"" and nothing more. Having no more hope for better, just the choice between ""is this it? really?"" and taking the jump risking ending in a worse situation just to have a chance at a better situation.  Now I have to figure out this whole dating thing (again). A lot has changed in 16 years.

1nmwg0w,1758472044,2025-09-21T16:27:24Z,offmychest,I crave instability,"I crave strong emotions, to the point where I rather feel pain over being bored/stable. For the past 3 years, I noticed a pattern in myself where I chase emotional highs. In my free time I feel crazy, especially when I’m alone with no one to distract me. I just want to feel hurt, or any really strong, visceral emotions. I find that positive ones usually never measure up to negative ones. Recently I’ve done my best to act as sane as possible but I miss how I use to be. Things I use to chase this indescribable emotional high that I miss so so bad: - the usual sh. But I’ve been clean for 9months now. - dated someone I knew was going to abuse me, but the obsession and high he gave me was addicting. I never knew when he would snap at me, and that feeling was insane. 6 months.  - objectified myself to feel something - Drinking until I blackout in clubs - Cutting off people (even long time friends) if they wrong me once, conflict is fun. But this is also why my circle is very small. I can never keep people around for long. - Going back to toxic friendship that was on and off for 3years, of him threatening to end it all etc, and then saying he loved me. - Purposefully not sleeping for days just so I can feel that high  I feel like this isnt normal? its driving me crazy how calm my life is now, I’ve put in so much work to stabilize myself and the people around me, but sometimes I just want to regress to how i use to be. I don’t want to become that toxic person again… I don’t know what to do.  For context, I have not been formally diagnosed with anything yet, but I’ve been getting back into therapy. I don’t want to self diagnose, but I’ve been doing some reading and I think my experiences are somewhat in line with bpd?

1nmxoqm,1758474953,2025-09-21T17:15:53Z,offmychest,I am a cheater.,"I am a cheater.  There, I fucking said it.  I'm a dirty, rotten, slimy, lowlife, scum-sucking, no-good, back-stabbing, soul-sucking, piece of shit cheater.  I don't condone what I've done. I don't excuse it. I don't want to justify it. It was wrong and I knew it was wrong and I did it anyway and I'm a worse person for that. I shat on my marriage and betrayed a good man and sullied my own moral values. It was selfish and impulsive and poorly thought out and there's a special place in hell for me for it. I hit a new low and proved myself capable of even more vile behavior than I imagined. I went and settled the debate once and for all: I am, indeed, a bad person.  And for what?  **What was the fucking payout for selling a piece of my goddamn soul**?  Huh? What? Someone, please, *enlighten* me.  \*crickets\*  This was a mistake. I'm not made for this life.   I understand, surely, I do. Far better than had I never gone down this misadventure. I can empathize with the feelings that would make someone stray, for I have felt them all too strongly.  But I **don't** understand what comes after.  I won't get into it for fear of violating the sub's rules but... there's something deeply disturbing about serial cheaters.  They're not right.  If you wander over to their sub, you'll see what I mean.  Deeply, deeply disturbing.  Revolting.  I'm a raging hypocrite, of course.  I don't know if I can say I regret what I did even while acknowledging it was a huge mistake.  But I do know beyond a shadow of doubt I'm one and done.    The million dollar question is... am I done yet?   My gut says its time to end it.  But it was time to end it after the first time.  It was time to end it after a week.  It was time to end it after our first fight.  It was time to end it after a month.  And yet... months later, here we are.    It's long overdue.  But I'm scared.  I *think* I'm in a place where I can let him go without setting off my anxious attachment spiral.  But then again, maybe that's just the anger talking me up and the moment it sinks in that he's *gone*, for real, I'll unravel into a frantic, bawling mess of snot and tears.  Don't want that.  That's a bad state to be in because it makes for impulsive, life-altering decisions.  Like cheating.    I'm not a jilted lover or a spurned woman.  I'm not even angry *at him*.  I do genuinely care for him and I am fond of him as a person and a friend--and that's what makes this so hard.  But it's finally sinking in that *there's nothing here*.    It's a tired stereotype--the naive younger woman who really believes *he'll leave his wife for me*! while getting played by an older man who sees her nothing more than an easy fuck.  That's not what happened here.  He was very clear--he will never leave his wife; he never falls in love.   He was always direct and polite.  He let me set the pace.  I went into it with my eyes open.  I'm just... really fucking dumb, I guess.  Yeah.  I fell for him.  Didn't expect to.  But I did.  And once I did... well.  The stars in my eyes made it hard to see clearly, ya know?  I fed the fantasy.  The *maybe one day*.  I painted this picture in my head of *our* future, one where we didn't sneak around or lie or cheat.  A future where we were soulmates who found each other against all odds.  And that one in a million chance of possibility made it worthwhile.  Like I said.  Really fucking dumb.  But the stars have died out and my eyes are in focus.  I see the problems now.  Even if *maybe one day* happened... we're just too different.  Our lives would never mesh cleanly, even if our hearts beat in sync.  Compromises would have to be made, and with them would come resentment and frustration.  It would never work, not in the long term.    I don't know.  I guess I'm a little slow.  The realization hits harder than it should.  It sucks the warmth from my body and leaves me wondering *why are we even doing this*?  Because if not for love, then what could *possibly* justify the cost of this?",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmxoqm/i_am_a_cheater/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmxoqm/i_am_a_cheater/
1nmxwub,1758475476,2025-09-21T17:24:36Z,depression,New Beginnings,"TW: suicide ideation, emotional/physical/sexual abuse, infidelity, depression, and kinks.  I'm probably getting divorced soon. I've been with this person for 3 years but only married a little over a year. There have been so any issues from in law drama, oversharing to family, broken trust, gambling and financial infidelity, etc. I struggle with anger management and emotional regulation, especially when I've been hurt badly. (I have a couple of mental disorders as well.) I've been so unhappy and wanting to leave for the longest time, but it's been a back and forth type of thing.   In addition, when I returned after our first separation, I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. I didn't receive the support I needed from my family at all (emotionally) & one of my family members tried to take advantage of me during a vulnerable time. I've been very depressed and feeling neglected since last year. Medication has helped a bit (I started this summer), but healing from trauma and betrayal is a long journey.  The idea of a divorce has stirred up a lot of emotions. I've been crying a lot these past few days and also feeling a lot of anger when I think about what happened. I am completely heartbroken, devastated, and scared. Moreover, I wanted to end it, but then I thought about it and asked him if there was another chance. He already made up his mind 😔. Despite everything, I still love him a lot.   For a while, our relationship felt amazing. He made me feel beautiful and safe in ways I’d never experienced. I grew up very insecure and craving attention; I had abuse in my childhood (physical, emotional, and sexual), so I built walls to protect myself. I finally let someone in, and that’s what makes this hurt so much. This was my first serious relationship and the first time I felt real love. It hurts SO badly, and I never want to go through this again.   There are some things I'm not willing to do that are super important to him, like playing video games and engaging in certain kinks. It seems like those are his biggest issues. I told him on our first date I don't like video games. I have opened up and played more, but don't expect to become a gamer. He also wants to do extreme BDSM that I'm just not comfortable with (I'm only ok with certain things). So, his solution is to get someone else involved so he can satisfy his needs, which I'm obviously not ok with either. Additionally, he complained that he always has to stop or slow down during sex. I have pelvic floor dysfunction and get more anxious when someone isn't listening to me. I feel uncared for and like I'm not good enough. The things I've been missing are based on love, respect, and feeling beautiful and cherished.  I’m terrified and unsure about what’s next. I’ve been dependent on him for the last two years. I don’t have friends, and I don’t have a safe, supportive family to turn to. I’m juggling the end of my marriage and extreme depression while trying to figure out logistics and what to do next. I feel like I can’t take this pain.  Has anyone been through something similar? How did you get through the first few months? Any practical steps (legal, financial, emotional) I should focus on first?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmxwub/new_beginnings/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nmxwub/new_beginnings/

I'm not looking for a diagnosis either, I just wanted to get this whole story off my chest.  It was after the pandemic. It was such a dark period of my life. I kept failing at school, I didn't have a job and I was overall just neglecting myself. I was really depressed. I also had many traumatic events happen consecutively. I used to spend so muche time alone.  When I finally found a job it felt like I just forgot how to interact with other people. People would talk to me and I would just stare and smile. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't speak most of the time.  Many people were talking behind my back and treating me like the weirdo I was. My employer would yell at me and belittle me, knowing I wasn't going to talk back. I just don't know what happened to me.  When I couldn't take it anymore I just switched job, but the same thing happened again. I was unable to speak unless I had to ask a question and even then it would take me days or weeks to do so. Sometimes I waited until I was alone and just sent an email. Phone calls were nightmare fuel to me.  Trying to speak would mean cold sweats, uncontrollable shaking, almost getting a panic attack all the time. When I managed to speak, people would look at me in awe, like ""ooooh, so they can speak"" and make things even worse. I sometimes said thing that didn't make sense or stop and go silent suddenly.  Elaborating a sentence took a lot of time. It took me so long that by the time I was ready to answer a question or join a conversation the topic would have changed several times at that point.  I felt so isolated. I thought that maybe there was something wrong with my brain honestly. I thought that maybe I was sick or suddenly having a speech impediment (maybe because I was stressed and burned out). I even though that maybe I had brain damage or something.  My family has no idea. I'm not very talkative and I didn't feel axious around them obviously. So they didn't even notice. But I was so scared about them meeting my coworkers and learning the thruth.  I wish I got therapy, but I was broke and it's so damn expensive where I live.  I eventually overcame it on my own some months ago. It only stopped when I somehow started getting on my feet again. I have graduated and have a stable job now.   I made sure to cut all contact with those who knew me before, I just don't want to face them. I don't know what would happen to me... I feel guilty when I think about those who were kind to me and didn't judge me, but I was impulsive and  now there's no hoing back.  It just feels so bizzare and unreal.

Fast forward two years and I found a small palpable lymph node in my neck and of course freaked out. I went to the doctor who said it’s nothing but referred my for an ultrasound purely for my peace of mind.  I got the results of the ultrasound the other day and everything came back normal and benign thankfully it’s just a reactive node, however a bunch of other benign tiny nodes also showed up on the scan which is ofc normal but my health anxiety self didn’t like that lol. Anyway my doctor called me and said everything is good and I can come back and repeat the scan in three months to see that nothing is changed. Idk what to do bc the scan is very expensive and to be honest I didn’t need the first scan at all if it wasn’t for my health anxiety telling me I did.  Is it okay to not get another ultrasound in three months and just move on with my life? My health anxiety is now telling me I have to but my rational self cannot see the point. I raised this to my doctor and he said yeah don’t bother with it and just get a blood test as you haven’t had one in ages and if that comes back normal just move on.

Resulted in criminal charges (including a felony), spending ~$5-6k in Europe in one week, losing my return offer at a bank, multiple academic withdrawals/failures, and a good amount of strife for everyone involved.**  I grew up a quieter kid and generally struggled to make close friendships with people. As I entered high school and couldn't play a lot of organized sports, I no longer spent time in the environment where I used to socialize. I played competitive video games to replace that competitive outlet, so most of my socialization as a teenager was in Discords and Teamspeaks. I met my first girlfriend on a Discord server and we ended up going to university together as well.   My world was so small growing up, and I often daydreamed of future days where my world would be far bigger. Like many young people, I felt that university would be that place of expansion, and I spent my freshman year taking new classes, meeting new people, hanging with my partner (we had been long-distance for over two years at that point). Pretty typical year--getting sent home for COVID lockdowns was less typical. After a while of remote classes I decided to rent a place near campus with people I was vaguely friends with and they brought me into their big group of friends. These were what I consider my first ""true"" friendships--they were genuinely interested and amused by me, myself similarly enthralled by them. My girlfriend and I broke up during this time, as we both realized we were growing into different, maybe incompatible people. I was just really struck by how genuine the care was amongst this group of people, and felt fortunate to be part of that network of care. It felt like the right environment to pause and reflect on who I wanted to be, who I really was, and who I was becoming.   I also became really close with one of the roommates and we started dating. This relationship was far different in character than my previous, and although it was shorter, we became far closer. By the end, she was probably the person who knew me best. I don't think I can describe it well, and any attempt just sounds like me trying to particularize a universal human experience, but I just felt seen around her in a markedly distinct way. I felt uniquely comfortable to just sit silent in their presence, when for most of my life that experience came with painful feelings of anxiety and guilt that turned my face into a kettle.  By junior year, classes were back in person and I spent most of the year trying to get an internship for that summer, my free time was spent on classwork or hanging out with my partner. I hadn't talked to friends much or shown up at gatherings because of this, but at the time it felt like it worked out, as I secured an internship and would be able to catch up with friends our senior year. My girlfriend and I spent that summer in NYC splitting a tiny apartment and working. We knew it would be stressful but I think we underestimated how stressful that summer was, and we split up that August. At the time, I felt blindsided after being spread so thin the entire year, I think she felt increasingly trapped in a relationship with someone who she felt she couldn’t grow with.   Regardless, we both cared about each other and it hit me particularly hard. We had a trip to Europe to see her family lined up at the end of summer, we ended up both going solo, and this trip was really tough. It was out of character for me, going around accosting a bunch of random locals, spam calling friends back home, spending basically all the money I had left over from that summer, and scouring the streets of Paris for prostitutes. Fortunately I had the presence of mind to navigate to a psychiatric hospital and they treated me enough to be able to get back home.  Basically the following week, I jumped right back into classes, just looking to finish that semester and graduate on time to begin my full-time job in New York. I got a good start in September, but going into October I began struggling to sleep. At some point early in the week, my thoughts started getting rapidly more disordered and paranoid, and by Friday my ex and a couple of our close friends asked my parents to intervene out of concern. I do not remember most of this week and the memories I do have are unreliable, but when my parents showed up, the situation they saw led them to call the local police, and I ""woke up"" days in the ER with three-point restraints and two criminal charges. One was felony assault on a peace officer and one was misdemeanor evading arrest.  Once I was stable enough, they brought me to an initial hearing, where this news dawned on me (I'm sure people informed me before this but it was in one ear out the other). After that, I stayed in the inpatient ward for a week, and participated in a court-mandated outpatient program. I found out later the only reason I was in the ER and not still in a cell was because a mental health advocate had been in the courtroom for that hearing, and redirected my case. Unable to finish my last semester, I dropped my classes and focused what energy I had on my case and new Bipolar I diagnosis.  Early the following year, my case came before the judge and with that came discovery in the days leading up, including bodycam and dashcam footage of my arrest. The prosecutor and my public defendant thankfully decided to drop the charges upon reviewing this footage, and by March/April the case was expunged. By then my friends were all gearing up for graduation, that semester I was struggling to be functional and I ended up failing/withdrawing from a second semester. I spent the summer and winter at home, working at a local restaurant and trying to just get out of this stunlocked state of existing.  I resumed university the following year and finally finished that last semester in May. I moved back home and have been here since--it took me about a year to find a full time job and now I'm living at home, saving up money to move out. I turned 24 this August, it's been three years since all of this happened.   I imagine I would have already struggled with the social transition from university to adult life, but all of this made it really difficult to maintain/reinvigorate friendships, which I was going to have to do regardless after disappearing most of junior year. Meeting new people has remained difficult and I've struggled to make authentic connections. Despite my efforts to connect via text messages, asking friends if they want to catch up on the phone, visiting people in their cities, it feels like they've all either moved on or are in the process of moving on. At some point I just realized that I was starting all the conversations, and I just felt like I was bothering people. This year I reached out much less and it has been a really quiet year. Sometimes I think I alienate people and make them feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I think that I graduated a year late and everyone else is just at a different point in their life. Sometimes I think I did something grievously wrong that week in October and people are justified in disconnecting from me. Sometimes I wonder if I was ever close with people at all, or if I just perceived us to be close because I had no prior barometer for measuring that.  I feel so alone, I feel like the longer I spend time alone, the more socially clumsy, uninteresting, and bitter I become, and the more I reinforce my own isolation. And I know many people my age also struggle with loneliness, no matter how many details I provide my experience can't be that novel. But it's been a really tough few years and it's been difficult to conceptualize possibilities for the future, much less a coherent and unified vision of the future. Most of the time I just feel very overwhelmed and want to cry.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn0a7x/im_24_m_struggling_with_motivation_and_loneliness/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn0a7x/im_24_m_struggling_with_motivation_and_loneliness/

I think a big part of my depression stems from the fact that I’m far from conventionally attractive. I’ve never been complimented on my looks, and I feel invisible everywhere I go. I’ve been bullied and singled out for my ugliness all of my life. I’ve been in therapy and tried countless medications for my mental illnesses over the years, but nothing has worked.  I know what surgeries I need to fix my face, but I won’t be able to afford them nor get a loan to afford them anytime in the near future, and insurance won’t cover it. The only option I feel like I have is to end my life. I don’t want to keep living life as an ugly, mentally ill man. I have enough saved up in my bank account from working a part time job to cover the cost of a funeral so my family won’t have to pay for it.  I don’t want to receive any comments about how it will “get better” and “looks don’t matter.” I’ve experienced lookism firsthand my whole life. Anyways, if anyone has any ideas or guidance on how I can get the surgeries I need as soon as possible, please tell me.

I could probably put this in a few subreddits, but I'm posting here. I (38M) went back to school this year, a med school grad program. Most people are fresh out of undergrad, a few people are older than me, nobody I've met within 8 years either side except for some faculty. Been out of the game for much of the last 8 years recovering from a concussion, out of work for 5 of those years. The post-concussion recovery brought up a lot of issues I never had previously. Used to love crowds, ballgames, festivals, outdoor markets, etc. Those scenarios now bring up a lot of fear, anxiousness and pain. Getting so much better, and I have cried tears of joy about how well I'm doing if I have to be in a loud space with lots of background commotion for an hour or so.     Never was popular. Bullied by kids outside home. Bullied by my brother inside the home. Moving states and schools soon after Columbine frightened me. The thing that is eating at me this weekend is how I feel in social settings. I care about the people I care about a lot. I reach out. I try to put more effort in. I try to show more appreciation at all times. I try to ask questions and enter conversations planning to not use the word ""I."" If I put my phone in my drawer and left it there for a month, not a single friend or peer would reach out. I know for a fact. I've avoided the internet for friends, possibly at my loss, because it doesn't feel the same if we're not in the same room. It feels like I'm using the disconnect to force something that can get to deeper layers.    I am looking into if I make everything about myself. Possibly, but doesn't feel like that much based on some harsher descriptions. If I brought up my concussion in school, I pause to make sure what I say will be relevant to all of our patient interactions in the future. One thing is, if I'm standing in a group of 4, it's only a matter of time until the other 3 orient themselves in a triangle. If it's a group of 3, the other two will eventually square off towards each other. They don't look at me. When I chime in, no matter how pertinent the comment is, I get looks like they had to exit something and my comment was a distraction. It's a feeling, could be incorrect mind-reading. I literally don't know if I should be standing there still, or quietly leave and awkwardly look for another place to stand.     I can't do what I am choosing to do alone, and all my life I've felt invisible. People tell me I'm interesting, but nobody is interested. People have a high opinion of me and see my light when I think there's no shine, but nobody has ever wanted to make sure I'm apart of something. Would drive me crazy when I would try to initiate something with my undergrad friends. They'd be waiting to hear back from someone else. They weren't sure what was going on. When I was the first to propose something on an empty weekend, I was never the person they were waiting to hear back from, or the person getting something going on.     I know I need patience. I know I need to give myself grace, and give the people around me the grace I would want. I'm praying for a sign that somebody cares. I'm struggling with my faith here, too. I know all is possible through God, but I don't believe anybody able to reach out and hug me will do so, or will be inspired to check in with me, or reconnect with me. Probably reads like a big Eeyore tale, but I need to get this off my chest so I can focus on mid-terms coming up.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn1mu7/feel_invisible/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn1mu7/feel_invisible/

I managed to get thing a bit more under control with medication. I now live at home for a variety of reasons, but my mental health being the biggest one.  It wasn't too bad up until fairly recently. Just going through the normal routine. Until there was a tragedy that happened to someone I go to church with. It doesn't affect me directly, but it was about when my mental health started to decline again.   I was trying to sleep the other night when I kind of realized how unhappy I am. I'm doing way better than I was before, but that really doesn't mean much because of how bad it was.  I just kind of realized that I was just so much happier when I was in high school. I was homeschooled, and am doing online college, so I didn't think the change would be that difficult. And, the school is basically the same, but I'm a bit miserable.  I'm too old to go to my church's youth activities, and that was something I had to look forward to every week. I don't have anything like that anymore. It also means that I go to adult Sunday school where I'm the youngest there by several years. My friends who are still in youth are busy with school, and my friends who have already graduated have jobs or have moved away.  I'm trying to get a job for a month, but haven't gotten anything. So, I can't go out and do things. It's just school church, and taking care of my cat. I like  those things, but I can't help but feel like nothing of it really matters.  It's affecting so many things and it's started to wear me down. I couldn't go to church today because I got less than five hours of sleep because I was crying and being angsty.

1nn42u0,1758489712,2025-09-21T21:21:52Z,offmychest,I was a creep,"Back when I was 20, I had a crush on a 15 year old and confessed. We were pretty good friends then and I used to always get crushes on people I grew close with. I am asexual so it was purely borne of the connection I thought I felt at the time. I wasn't expecting anything, just wanted to tell them because I thought it wasn't fair they were talking to me when I was feeling this way. We stopped talking after though I did try to go back to being friends like an idiot.  Thinking about that now makes me want to puke. It's been more than a decade and I still cannot believe, that at 20, I didn't know or realize it was wrong. I always thought I knew more about the world and I still did that.  This is no excuse, it's just how I think I might have thought it was okay at the time. In my country while I was growing up, I often heard stories of relationships between people of ages like that. So, in some way, I didn't even consider it to be wrong until I learned more from the Internet.  The past few years have been busy with me trying to settle in life so I didn't think about what happened much. But now I keep thinking about it and feeling guilty about putting all of that on a kid.   And now that I am actually looking for a relationship, I feel like I should be open about this one event that happened to any potential date so they can make an informed decision. I don't know if I should leave it in the past or not.

I know jealousy is ugly, but I can’t help it.  She’s stunning, smart, confident, and can literally talk to anyone. Meanwhile, I’ve always struggled with social anxiety, so we’re total opposites socially. She talks to guys so easily, and multiple guys have confessed to liking her. And that’s just the ones who said it out loud—who knows how many more there are.  When school started, we got our schedules. She wanted to go around asking people who was in our classes. I didn’t care that much because I’m not “known” like that. But we went up to these two guys together, and she checked their schedules. Turns out I was in their class but she wasn’t. Then she goes, “It’s okay, you guys have (my name) in your class.” THANK GOD they didn’t hear her, because I was fuming. It felt like she was trying to put me on the spot and embarrass me.  I think this all really started when I liked one of her guy friends. Every time I’d talk to him, he’d ask about her or where she was. They started texting too, even though they weren’t close before, and when I brought him up she acted weird about it. I felt like she liked him back. I’m over him now, but ever since then, I’ve had this resentment toward her.  And it’s not just guys. She’s close with basically all the girls in our classes too. They text her, hang out with her, and seem to just… prefer her. I try to branch out, but it always feels like people pick her over me.  This year I’ve started to think another guy is cute. Not a full-blown crush, but I do like him. And then I overheard her talking to him about going to the gym together because she wants to switch to the one he goes to. She has no idea I like him a little, so it’s not her fault, but it still killed me. Like, no guy just casually goes to the gym with a pretty girl unless he’s into her. That just made me feel worse.  The thing is, I do love her. I’m not a bad friend I’d tell her if she had something in her teeth or hype her up if she looks good.

1nn7b9b,1758498245,2025-09-21T23:44:05Z,offmychest,I'm afraid to be one of the things I hate so much. A bully.,"When I was growing up, I was a fat kid. Of course I was bullied, and I suppressed memories from back then. But sometime in sixth grade I met my first real friend. It really felt like we were the same — we had so much in common. As time went on, we became more hostile toward each other because we loved to argue about literally everything, and those arguments went so far that one of us would end up really pissed off. After a long summer break we went on a school trip, and right there they said they couldn't keep up with the bullshit anymore and would do anything to leave the school (which was our only way of seeing each other). The last thing they said then was that my other friends and I were obviously bullying them. It left me speechless. After years of experiencing bullying myself, why was I suddenly the one in the wrong? To be honest, they also had — and still have — a lot of personal struggles and other reasons for wanting to change their life so drastically. There were about two years of absolutely no contact between us, and in that time I kept asking myself: what did I do wrong? What did I not see? Since I was in therapy and working on my well-being, I decided to text them. Not some weird-ass message — I took my time and wrote the text carefully because I just wanted to clear things up. Had I really been the person I despise without noticing? We texted a bit and updated each other, but shortly after they said it would be better if we had no contact, and since then I always think about it. I'm always scared it will happen again with any other loved one. I just really feel like a bad person without knowing why. It's something that stays in my head 24/7.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn7b9b/im_afraid_to_be_one_of_the_things_i_hate_so_much/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn7b9b/im_afraid_to_be_one_of_the_things_i_hate_so_much/

1nn7inx,1758498817,2025-09-21T23:53:37Z,offmychest,"I witnessed a motorcycle fatality yesterday, and want to vent a bit.","TL;DR: stay on your side of the road, wear good gear and a proper helmet, know how to use and carry first aid, and don't push yourself past you or your bike's abilities - because it will kill or seriously harm you and others.  I need to get this off my chest, warning as this is rather morbid. Just over 24 hours ago, I was one of the first ones to roll up to a fatality with two motorcycles involved on US129 Tail of the Dragon. For the privacy of the individuals, I will not disclose names or descriptions of the bikes.  I tagged along with a group of motorcycles yesterday, as I pulled off right near where a car spun out and smacked its trunk into a tree. I chatted with the guys for a few minutes and joined up with them. The first two of the group departed from the pulloff, a car came past, and the next three of us followed suit. The car and one of the bikes I was with pulled off to let the two of us in back pass, and a few miles up, we carefully passed a tow truck fishing out another car from off the side, with a TSP trooper infront of it. A mile down the road, we rolled up to the first guy of the four of us, still conscious on the road on his back, bike on its side and obliterated. We were only about 30 seconds behind them.  The two riders between the guy and I stayed back and cordoned off traffic, and I immediately whipped my bike around and went full-send to grab the trooper a mile behind us. I got to the trooper after riding beside a small line of cars, as both sides were just blocked off for the tow truck. I yelled out that rider was down, and gave the mile post and description and immediately hightailed it back to the accident.   I parked my bike and got my gear off, at the pulloff of the corner beside the crash, and I noticed the second individual on the road. He did not survive. The first guy of the group was conscious and speaking, but going into mild shock and panic attacks. The trooper arrived about 30 seconds after I showed back up, and immediately called for an ambulance and a second TSP car. I waved down oncoming traffic from behind us to slow down, as people were making their way up once the tow truck was out of there. Fortunately, in both lines of stopped cars, a pair of nurses were present, one was able to get a full-size bag before the ambulance arrived.  The individual who was killed in this accident had approached the righthand corner at a speed far too fast and crossed over the centerline, and hit the first guy head-on. The first guy of our little group survived due to the helmet and full armor he wore, and the quick actions of the individuals of the group.  I'm exceptionally grateful that a cop was only a short distance behind us, as there is no cellular service on that road, and I made major mistake of not having any first aid equipment in my backpack that day. That changed today, as I now carry a trauma kit and trauma shears in my bag now so I won't make that mistake again.  He was in stable enough condition that he did not have any immediate life-threatening injuries, compound fractures or visible bleeding. He was airlifted to UTK.  The other individual involved in the collision was not as fortunate. I'm desensitized enough from my Honor Guard experience in observing the dead, but this was different. This was the first time in my life of seeing a deceased individual out of nowhere, and that will be something that will most likely live rent-free in my mind for the rest of my life. I don't want to sensationalize it, but the moment I grasped the man was dead was a deep feeling of dread and remorse, and I've lost my composure several times over the past day. Riding home after the road was cleared up was one of the hardest rides of all, as I had to pull over a few times to refocus on getting home without bawling my eyes out.  This will not deter me from my love of motorcycles, but it will help me be better and solidify the direct consequences of riding past one's ability on an exceptionally dangerous road.  Stay safe out there.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn7inx/i_witnessed_a_motorcycle_fatality_yesterday_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn7inx/i_witnessed_a_motorcycle_fatality_yesterday_and/
1nn7sea,1758499572,2025-09-22T00:06:12Z,offmychest,Finally asked my husband for a divorce and he completely changed without hesitation,"And I still massively distrust it.  We've been married 13 years, have 3 boys (11, 9, and 6), and it wasn't until the last 3 years that I've been really struggling with how his mental health affects me. 3 years ago, our middle was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and my husband got really mean. I knew he was struggling with the weight of the diagnosis and the lifestyle change and how my ADHD made it more difficult for me to help manage his condition, but he said some things that were just downright cruel.  Fast forward to a year ago, he's more distant and has begun to say he resents that I'm the fun parent and he has to be the actual parent. He starts really distancing from me and as time goes on, we're basically roommates. There are moments of happiness, but by then I'm struggling so much with anxiety and insomnia induced anxiety that I need to go on sleep meds and anxiety meds in addition to my ADHD meds. The anxiety ones don't work. In the mean time, my kids are severely struggling with how my husband essentially harasses them, I'm trying to stand up for them because now they're scared of coming to him with their struggles but whenever I do, my husband says something cruel toward me and walks off. He's also threatened by my relationship with them and how he feels like he's always the bad guy.  It got so bad that my middle child told me he wants me to divorce my husband. My therapist told me that a lot of his treatment of me was borderline abuse.  I finally tell him I want a divorce because I haven't gotten over (even though I thought I would) when he essentially kicked me out of the house because my depressive episode was preventing him from parenting properly and he just needed me out. I can tell he's surprised but he doesn't really react. Then I tell him the full extent of how his treatment of the kids is affecting them, he leaps into action, tells me he had no idea that was going on (keep in mind that my middle kid had spent the past 3 weeks telling him to not touch him, how my husband stresses him out, how he's terrified of him, and how frustrating it is to know that I am telling him how to parent them the way they need and he won't do it). My husband also told me that if I had just said, ""the kids are hurting and that's a deal breaker for me"" he would have understood. Problem is, I had been telling him. Through tears, through conversation, through warning him how his actions are going to hurt the kids, how I feel like a shadow and I'm getting crumbs in our relationship. I'd been telling him for months, probably years. He never changed. Never made attempts. Always dismissed me, told me I was coddling the kids, protecting them from their own feelings, not allowing them to learn how to deal with adults who asked them to do things they didn't want, told me I was overreacting. Now he's saying that he had no idea I was advocating for forming a relationship first with the kids and then the disciplining would come second and easier. I had told him. I'd used almost those exact words, but because I didn't use an ultimatum or a threat or a demand, he thought we were just chatting about ""what ifs.""  He stepped up. He changed. Overnight he went from completely distant and neglectful to emotionally involved in me, the kids, and being productive around the house. My anxiety is completely gone and I'm sleeping so well. He's doing everything I'd been begging him to do without so much as batting an eye and he loves it.  I'm fuming. Fuming that he didn't react at all when I told him how his behavior affected me, but leapt into action when I told him how his treatment of the kids was affecting them, even though I'd told him many times before, just in a way where he thought I was hypothesizing how it'd affect them (my exact words were, ""how you're parenting is going to negatively affect them in these ways."" Fuming that his solution was to completely stop parenting the kids and just be the fun parent who gently guides them, which is exactly my approach and puts most of parenting on my shoulders, which I just see as a practice run for when I'm doing it by myself. He says it was an overnight switch and all the frustration and anxiety he had around my parenting and how I move through the world is just gone. That's great. I love that for him. BUT. It feels like he knows exactly what he was doing and is now trying to patch the holes in the sinking ship.  Like, is he willfully ignorant, actually knows what he's doing, or is the way he treats people so massively ingrained that he doesn't get it at all. HOW could he not KNOW?? 😣😣  I told him marriage counseling probably won't change my mind and I'm willing to do a few sessions. I'm still set on a divorce, but now he just made it so much harder to go through with it.  EDIT: I'm filing.

I was just concerned with getting across the street and getting home that by pure luck I managed to look in time. I was ten minutes from being home.   When I did get home, I called my closest sibling because I was having a panic attack and needed to calm down. They said they were sorry that happened and then changed the subject to something they bought earlier in the day because they thought it would ""cheer you up."" I got off the phone not long after because I felt disgusted by it. No comforting, no ""Oh I'm so glad it didn't hit you,"" nothing of the sort. A part of me wishes it would have.

1nn89es,1758500922,2025-09-22T00:28:42Z,depression,I finally realized I will never get better,"I would say I have struggled quite a bit with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. I’m 23 now, almost 24 and I’m starting to realize it’s just getting worse. I have struggled with this for a long time but I would say it comes and goes, and so far I’ve made it through. It does have a seasonal effect for me, typically gets worse in the fall/winter. This is the first season I am out of school. 1.5years ago I got a BS in mechanical engineering and now this August I finished my MS. Even more, I am now working at an aerospace startup on some cool government research contracts. I like my job a decent amount, and I am really lucky to have that opportunity. As a way to cope with my depression, I’ve sunk myself really deep into the school/work grind and I’m proud of what I have accomplished.  Unfortunately it has not helped my depression at all. I always thought if I did the right things: 1) work hard and get a good job 2) Eat healthy and 3) get in good shape. I thought these things could make me happy.  But I am just so alone. I barely have any friends. My only friends are slowly drifting away from me, as they are all getting married/starting families and such. I don’t blame them. Meanwhile I am single with no prospects of getting into a relationship. I feel like I am too late. Having a good job and being fit don’t really mean anything at all if you can’t meet anyone. Now that I am out of school my life consists of gym, work, then just being alone for the rest of the day. I hardly interact with anyone anymore, and I really don’t feel like reaching out and bothering anyone anymore. I want to tell my parents about how I am feeling, but I have a hard enough time admitting how depressed I am even to myself. Nothing you can achieve externally means anything when you’re all alone. Money doesn’t matter when you’re all alone. I can’t live like this for much longer.

1nn89ua,1758500957,2025-09-22T00:29:17Z,offmychest,My habit is becoming dangerous,"I 26F live in a highly populated city. After a stressful day I usually can’t sleep and I’ll be plagued with rumination. I get the strong urge to walk it off. Walking around at night is not recommended in my area. To make matters worse, I’ll wear noise cancelling headphones and maladaptive daydream to escape the stressors of the day. It’s relaxing, and can sometimes feel euphoric.   I’ve been doing this for years now. It started when I was depressed in my rural college town. I never encountered anyone and it became my go-to coping mechanism.  At first I started just walking a few blocks to get some fresh air, and would resume pacing in my room. Then my walks became longer and longer. Sometimes I’ll be high (weed) or tipsy on these walks. Most of the time I won’t. I’ve had encounters that would be more than enough to stop a sane person from doing it. At one point I just carried a pipe wrench around with me to stop men from mistaking me for a s*x worker but that was when I lived in a worse neighborhood.   One day I went out without my headphones and started walking a path I don’t usually take (I walk random paths that I’m acquainted with from my day walks on streets that I feel “safer” on.) I noticed all the alleys ways I could be pulled into, and dumpsters that I could be thrown behind. That was the “aha” moment. I realized my habit was becoming dangerous.   In hindsight, I feel like I should have recognized the danger much sooner, based on actual dangerous events occurring etc but my habit brought me so much relief that I would modify my behavior to make it “okay” again and start the nighttime trance all over.   I wouldn’t want someone I love to have a habit like this, but I justify doing it because it makes me feel better. My cognitive dissonance is pretty strong, and so is my shame.  I’m currently enrolled in mental health services. I haven’t discussed this with my providers yet, but I’m going to try this week.

Together almost 10 years.. he has never done anything like this at all    I am 4 months pregnant & a housewife So I was cooking and waiting for him to get home from work. There was an accident near our home, and I heard the crash. I knew it was a car accident but I didn’t know who or what happened.. for all I knew my husband could have been in it so I didn’t think much  I Ran down the road & it was a pretty bad accident. I’m not good in emergencies at all but I tried my best to help them. I had a slight anxiety attack but I didn’t do anything physically to hurt my baby or myself. So when emergency services came I called my husband to pick me up and he was absolutely livid.  There was another woman that lives near us that came to help and I told her I was pregnant and she just had me talking with emergency services. She helped way more than me, I have an anxiety attack because it was scary but I didn’t do anything physical to hurt our baby  He was still pissed, and said I never should have stepped foot outside and then told me I’m clearly “not ready to be a mother”  So I started crying, he started yelling at me to stay in the house, and all that. I was agreeing with him, and saying sorry.  He also had a really bad day so it added to his mood, and I told him I thought it could’ve been him and for some reason that set him off and he said “don’t f*cking worry about me” and hit me across the face  The thing is he immediately freaked out, started apologizing and picked me up. Asked if I was okay. I was really dizzy, but that’s it.   He has apologized everyday, and told me he didn’t mean to. He has been sweeter than ever since it happened and has asked me everyday if I’m okay. A lot of gifts and love but It’s just a hard situation for me  We met when we were super little because our parents were best friends. He’s been my best friend my whole life. Followed him to the US from Canada for his job, he always wanted me to stay home. I always trusted him completely and was okay with it. He has never even really yelled at me, and has protected me since we were kids.   To be honest I do still trust him, his reaction has been genuine but the whole thing is bugging me. He thinks I’m not ready to be a mom because I was trying to help people in an accident while pregnant, and he felt I put our baby in danger. And maybe he was right, maybe it was dumb but he then literally hit me so hard I fell to the ground.. which i think is worse. But if I said it made him not ready to be a dad it would be awful  And he’s still mad at me with that scenario a bit.. but yet expects me to move past what he did when we both apologized.",1341,735,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn8ejd/my_husband_hit_me_last_week_but_we_have_known/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nn8ejd/my_husband_hit_me_last_week_but_we_have_known/

It became migraines with aura, aka I have symptoms of severe migraines randomly without the migraine itself. For the past month my abilities have been severely declining. I cannot count past 20, always fall, my hands constantly shake and I drop a lot of things, I forget everything -including where I go, what I was doing and even memories- . My grip has weakened and I can’t feel my legs. They don’t take me as far and as quick as they used to. One time I’ve put my keys in the dryer (without even doing laundry), another I put important work papers in the microwave. There is so much more wierd incidents like this where I misplace things in very wierd spots even tho for months I placed them at the same place every single day.   I went to the doctor 2 days ago and they want me to do a brain scan. They don’t know what’s going on with me & they think that my migraines hid the underlying problem that I have. They decided to immediately contact a nearby hospital after doing some preliminary tests to get me in for a scan the quickest they could.   I also had a massive personality change and I only realized it a couple days ago. I severed ties with a lot of people whom I loved because I’m just mad at them for the littlest things they do. I’m becoming more and more impulsive and I hate myself for it. I did therapy but it doesn’t help at all. The only reason why I decided to take the medical route to see what’s wrong with me is because of my ex. The love of my life we could say. As much as I’ve loved him there was something in me screaming to push him away. But it waesnt me who was screaming in my head. I never wanted to hurt him, but I’m thankful that he made me realize that there was something deeply wrong within myself.  Honestly, I’m scared. Scared of myself, of what my diagnostic would be. My life is quickly deteriorating and I got no one to talk about my fears. Im always seen as the strong & funny one, who laughs at my own misery and always crawl back from the deepest pits I’ve been thrown into. I have to stay strong but my mind and my body are against me.

Roughly 4 years ago I (22m) met this guy (20m) Martin on tinder. I mentioned in my bio I was into astrology so Martin opened with a one liner that I couldn’t help but respond to. We were instantly hooked and could quite easily text for 4-5 hours straight without putting our phones down. I’ve never experienced sparks like that before and I started falling pretty hard pretty fast.  But about a month in there was this pit in my stomach that I couldn’t shake. Like something just didn’t sit right with me about being with him. Like I was doing something wrong, and he wasn’t right for me, as if I was somehow ignoring my intuition. I started acting slightly differently, as I’m not good at hiding my feelings. I could sense Martin replying less and the “fun” started to wear off.  As a back story, at this same time I was getting into the whole “law of attraction” manifestation space. The first time I heard about it I was like “this seems like a bunch of BS for rich white women to circle jerk around their imagined mansions and red Fararri’s” but then had a string of coincidences that seemed like there might be something to it. These could be all chalked up to confirmation bias, but I still decided to test it out for myself - just to see.  The only issue is that in this space you must suspend disbelief. That means, much like the placebo effect, you need to believe in something for it to actually work. This makes sense as “fake it till you make it” is not uncommon advice for confidence, but it also makes it incredibly hard to be unbiased with yourself.  So when Martin started pulling away, I mentally decided that it must be my fault. It must be my energy, my thoughts, my emotions, my whole self that’s responsible for him. Anyone not in the LOA space would understand that this is borderline narcissistic, while anyone in the LOA space would be clapping along with a big grin saying “YES JUST TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS!”  As you can probably tell, Martin and I started to fade away. But my obsession and borderline limerance did not. I was so freaking certain that it was my fault and I just needed to feel differently about it. If I could just make myself believe he loved me then I could have him back. If I could just do another technique, make myself think a certain way, hold the “frequency” or whatever then I would have him back.  It was getting hard to separate between what was real and what was not. Anytime you feel sad and start to believe that he’s not in your life anymore, LOA teachers just tell you to reaffirm that he is and to “revise” your past. When I go in on something, I go all in, so this was how I tried to test it out. The conclusion I made was that it wasn’t the framework’s fault, it must be mine for just simply not believing or “letting go” energetically well enough.  This had led me down many rabbit holes.   When it comes to metaphysics, spirituality, philosophy, and just the general “nature of reality”, I haven’t been able to separate myself from it all.  My anxiety has gotten worse over time because I no longer know what to believe.  My nervous system is more akin to a state of freeze as when I try to get started on anything in my life, such as starting a new routine or hobby, I’m immediately in my head about the energetics of it all. Or how my mind perceives it. Or how I emotionally feel. Or whether I should even act on my emotions or my mind. Or how to even be a fucking human again.  I’ve explored metaphysics, belief reprogramming, subconscious work, inner child work, depth psychology, existential philosophies, hermeticism, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Christianity, somatic experiencing, internal family systems, like freaking everything.  And to anyone who points out that I’m overcomplicating this and overthinking it: I know. It’s a compulsion. I’m not usually present in my day because when I start to try and deal with this big trash heap of thoughts and emotions it’s just too overwhelming.  I’m just at the point where I don’t know what to do. I want change. I want to actually commit to something and believe in it. To feel the ground that I’m on and feel safe on it. To trust the sensations in my own body. To be able to discern what thoughts actually hold validity and which ones are BS.  I want to learn how to enjoy life, open to its fullness, and love again. To fully love again.   I wrote this down in my journal yesterday: “I just want to be in my body, connected to the world around me, know that I am safe, be able to be myself around other people, and trust that what I’m feeling really is meant for me. That’s truthfully what I want right now. Genuinely. From my heart. That’s all I want right now, and I’m so sad that I feel like I can’t have it. These things that I see other people do so well I struggle with so immensely. It makes me feel broken and like I’m doing something wrong; like im incapable.”  I intellectually know that there’s only one thing between you doing the thing and living the life you want to live: the belief that you can. But I can’t make myself believe something that I don’t yet believe. And right now I just feel like I can’t, and I can’t change the believe that I can’t, and round it goes.  So yeah. This is the state of my brain and body, existential loops that would be enough to overload even a Snapdragon X Elite lol.  Just tryna put it out there to hopefully lessen some of the shame.

1nn92of,1758503282,2025-09-22T01:08:02Z,offmychest,I am devastated and don’t know how to move on,"We broke up a little over 7 months ago, and I still feel like I’m dying inside. I’ve been crying nonstop today and really need some perspective.  My ex (26M) and I (23F) broke up in March. Our relationship was rocky from the start in ally honesty. Our final breakup was in March 2025, he blocked me mid-argument (about a bag), ghosted me for two weeks, and then when I went to look for him in person he was sweet and crying that this was for th best and told me he felt like he becoming like his abusive dad. Anyways, we tried to get back together but within a week I could not deal with the being cussed at and broke up with him and never spoke to him again. Throughout the relationship, he’d sob (about everything, even to the point of not being able to drive) and would cry on the phone about me leaving him, tell me he loved me, but then explode and accuse me of things when I expressed my feelings.  For context: There were a lot of contradictions. He told me he was “disgusted” that he’d ever slept with this girl coworkerback in 2023 because she lied about having a bf the entire time. She started working with him again in January 2025, he even risked his job at one point to get away from her when  just to make me feel secure. We fought about her a lot because I felt insecure and even on our last time hanging out he saw that I was looking up her instagram and made a joke “why don’t you follow her at this point if you’re so obsessed with her? And she’s in another city now and engaged.”   Anyways, after we broke up, he sent long emotional texts calling me his “sweet girl” and promising he’d always love me. Then, a month later, he accused me of coercion and abuse in our sex life, which wasn’t true, but it was deeply painful to hear.  Now, months later, I’ve found out he’s been hanging out with that same girl he once called disgusting. To make it worse, she blocked me when I tried to add her on social media while she still had a boyfriend. Also, she was callling my ex weird to others because he randomly added her and liked all her instagram pics. And she recently posted her current bf in August! (Different from the guy she was with when they hooked up in 2023).   I feel worthless, like she must be prettier and “better,” even though logically I know he once said awful things about her. Everyone around me tells me his behavior shows he hasn’t grown and just regressed to familiar chaos. But my anxious-preoccupied brain can’t stop looping: why her, not me?  What makes this even harder is that I’ve been doing all the “right” things since the breakup. I have a new job starting October 1st, I’m applying for grad school, I’ve lost weight, I’m consistent with the gym and eating well, and I’ve been going out with friends. But inside, I still feel pathetic and like I’ll never move on.  How do I stop comparing myself to her? Why does my brain keep telling me she must be better when I know logically this isn’t about me at all? For anyone who’s been in a similar situation, how long did it take before you stopped obsessing about your ex and their new person?  I don’t want to be mean, but my ex is not really psychically attractive but very charismatic and doesn’t really have any long term friends. While I’m the opposite but I don’t really feel like going out with men yet (I have twice) because I feel like I am still healing. He’s 26 and I was his longest relationship and the only girl to ever meet his family (and they’re mostly estranged btw since he keeps away from most of them like his mom and dad except the sister he lives with).   I know healing isn’t linear, but I feel so stuck.

Two years felt like a long time to them. For context, I’ve never had a hard time dating or meeting men- honestly, that part has always come easy.  One holiday, after my cousins teased me about being single, my aunt told me: “Don’t let anyone pressure you. Use this time to grow, so when you meet the right man, you’ll also be the right woman for him.”  I held onto that. Now, more than five years single, I see why it mattered. Sure, I’ve felt the pressure, but I never asked for too much- just effort that lasts beyond the chase. That lesson gave me space to grow into myself, to feel secure in who I am, and to know I won’t lose myself in love.  Last night, after days of anxiety with my dad in the hospital, I chose gratitude instead. Something shifted. For the first time in a long while, I felt excited- excited to find and meet the man who’s right for me, to share travels and dreams, and to love with a steady, certain presence.  I just hope I’ll always see people clearly, and have the courage to walk away when something isn’t aligned.  Every heartbreak, every delay, brought me here. To wholeness. To love.

I’ve been in therapy for 3 and a half months and it has been the biggest waste of my money and time I’ve ever seen. My therapist is a nice guy and is kind of helpful for some specialized stuff but that’s it.  I told him how I’m unhappy, hopeless, bored, and frustrated with how little my life has changed despite my efforts (exercise, going outside, talking to people, etc).  He suggested to find a new hobby and do fun things more often.  Yeah I could’ve guessed that myself or even googled it if I really couldn’t think of that.  After seven years of unhappiness, I guess I just needed to find a new hobby.  Why tell anyone anything if they’re just going to give me some generic advice everyone with an iq above 80 knows?  Even for other issues I don’t get what it’s supposed to do.  I have social anxiety and haven’t had friends in 7 years and every session he just suggests to find more fucking clubs to join and places to go.   Duh, why didn’t I think of that?  Fuck I’ve been to clubs and multiple jobs and fifty classes and I just can’t make friends no matter how hard I try.  Yeah I’ll look for another club though, thanks.  We talk in circles every session.    All the advice for mental issues that therapists give can easily be found online and through five minutes of thinking.  Unless you are out of your mind and genuinely can’t think straight then there is no use. All therapists do is regurgitate generic advice while patting you on the back.  I only keep going because I’m out of options and hope I’ll get something out of it one day. Remember, they won’t make any money if you get better.

1nnaqa3,1758508061,2025-09-22T02:27:41Z,offmychest,Cheating and Confusing Breakup,"My now ex girlfriend just slept with one of my very best friends, only 1.5 months after we broke off a 6 year relationship and I need help processing and understanding what I should do to cope.   We had dated for 6 years, with some ups and downs but what I genuinely thought was a healthy happy relationship. Tons of amazing adventures, great memories, etc. Around year 4, I graduated college and got my first job as the CEO of a struggling nonprofit. It sucked the life out of me and only paid me if I was able to turn it around, but I really believed in the mission so I stuck with it. I had to bust myself working DoorDash, construction jobs, and everything in between just to make ends meet while I spent the rest of my time saving the nonprofit. This meant I couldn’t spend as much time with my girlfriend, but I thought she understood it would be temporary. I tried to do little things here and there to show her I was thinking about her, like buying her flowers every so often and planning dates roughly once a week, things like that. I later learned that during this time when I was extremely stressed from my work, she was becoming really unhappy with me.  She always loved to travel and frequently found research opportunities to go to third world countries like Tanzania and Sri Lanka. I thought nothing of it as we had done long distance many times during her 2-6 month trips. But this time, about 5 years in, she had an emotional affair while she was there with a local guy. She didn’t tell me until she returned and I found out by seeing their texts unexpectedly. I had a panic attack and was majorly freaking out, thinking this could never happen in our relationship, but then it did. I decided to try to forgive her, even though for the first month after she basically refused to block the guy, which I felt was a bare minimum thing to ask. 6 months and tons of couples therapy and tough conversations later, I really was able to forgive her and start to move on. One of my best friends, Derek, was there with us as a roommate during all of this and saw the struggle we went through.  Our relationship seemed to just keep getting better from there. I felt really optimistic. I had a new job as CFO of a company that was relocating to Spain and I thought finally I’d be on good financial footing and maybe my girlfriend would be willing to move in, since she loved exploring new countries. It seemed like the perfect time to seal us into a new beautiful life together. But unexpectedly she broke up with me soon after finding out about my move. She insisted it had nothing to do with the move but that she had always had doubts about us and she felt she had already waited too long for them to go away - better to cut it off now than prolong it any longer. I was devastated but I made sure she knew that I respected her decision and that I wished her nothing but the absolute best. And I really hoped we would stay friends, as did she.  1.5 months later, she calls me out of the blue to confirm my literal worst nightmare. She had started sleeping with my one of my best friends - Derek who lived with us during that tough period after she cheated. I was finally starting to feel good about things and just that day had gotten a rather large raise, but this completely ruined me. All I can picture is them doing the things that we used to do. I feel devastated because I lost my best friend and my ex girlfriend who I really hoped to be friends with on the same day. I’m the type of person that keeps only a few very close friends, so this was a huge blow. I feel betrayed by both of them, who both knew how hurtful this would be to me, and who had each told me in their own way that something like this could never happen.   Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice you can give on how to cope with this situation. I told both of them that I can’t be friends with them anymore after this, which was gut wrenchingly painful for me to do, but I knew if I kept talking to them it would just make me miserable thinking about them doing those things together all the time.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnaqa3/cheating_and_confusing_breakup/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnaqa3/cheating_and_confusing_breakup/

That’s my situation.   This next part is kind of gross. My morning starts out with an upset stomach. I felt myself panick attack-ish as I’m wiping after bowel movement. I was like “if this wiping doesn’t end soon I might need to stop early, grab my mints from upstairs (they too calm me), and change my underwear etc. Thankfully, this doesn’t happen.  On the drive to Church, I’m paranoid. As I’m waiting for a left turn to be safe, I’m INCREDIBLY anxious. I’m thinking “please don’t beep, please don’t beep” regarding the person behind me, because I wasn’t placing my trust in the turn signals. A beep in a situation like this would be very very scary for me, may God forbid one happens.   During Church, I’m basically having a panic attack throughout. Logically, I should’ve just gotten a drink refill and sat back down. Instead, I just sipped very slowly.  After, maybe the hardest part of my day, I almost begin conversation with a Deacon. Thing is, I felt like I couldn’t even have a conversation due to the thirst. So I’m thinking “am I going to have to walk away right after I initiate a conversation?” At least one person onlooking too. (Convo didn’t end up happening)  Things turn out right constantly.

I know it’s silly but hopefully someone out there will understand.   So a friend of mine told me about a job opening on her team. I’ve been looking for work for THREE years. I immediately applied for the job. She put in a good word for me and they contacted me about scheduling an interview for the following week. I told them that I was getting married that weekend but otherwise I was free and excited to be interviewing with them.   Like a fool I began to plan because I started to have hope for the first time in a long time.

I was excited because FINALLY I was getting somewhere. I’ve been competing with hundreds of people for every single role I applied to  and I finally had a slight advantage above everyone else.   She called me, she asked how my wedding was, we were vibing. I was like “yes! This is going so well!” I even thanked her again for wanting to interview me and giving me the chance.. only for her to tell me that she called to tell me that they went with someone else.

She also had a shit life so it makes me sympathize with her, but why do you also do this to your kids. No matter how many times I’ve pleaded and cried to her she doesn’t care and she yells and gets aggressive with me and then begs for my forgiveness later but she won’t fucking change. I hate myself and my life. I hate that im so trusting because all I really ever wanted is for my mom to love me and she doesn’t and I hate myself for still wanting that and thinking there’s somehow a possibility. Now I get angry so much more often and it’s because im so fucking upset and frustrated. I’m so frustrated I can’t get out. My entire life has been like this and it’s so stupid, it’s so stupid these fucking people can’t change after 17 years they’re so fucking irresponsible and stupid. It won’t fucking click to them because they’re so fine with being where they are and causing suffering to people because they’re just as miserable with the circumstance they made. I asked my mom a few weeks ago why she keeps staying with them and she says it’s grown people business. THEN WHY ARE YOU ABUSING ME. IT HAS TO DO WITH ME TOO ITS NOT JUST THE TWO OF YOU, YOU GUYS HAVE A FAMILY STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT. I start fucking crying at night and I can’t breathe I don’t know why but it’s happening so much more, one thing will happen and I will get so immeasurably frustrated from a small thing and I can’t control myself and I’ll just suffocate for 40 minutes and uncontrollably shaking and sobbing THEY CAUSED THIS AND THEY MADE ME FEEL LIKE THIS SO NO ITS NOT JUST YOUR BUSINESS WHEN I CANT BREATHE BECAUSE OF YOU",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nncki3/all_of_my_mental_health_issues_are_a_direct/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nncki3/all_of_my_mental_health_issues_are_a_direct/

New sports, new hobbies, running until I can’t breathe, learning new skills, planning new trips, chatting up complete strangers. I’ve tried reaching out to old, current and new friends bc I’m desperate for connection. My life has had a lot of changes lately including a  long-term relationship ending up, which I’ve had several months to process and be alone with my thoughts and feelings. I’m going to therapy to talk out my issues. I write my thoughts down so that I’m not trauma dumping on friends. I don’t feel as though I’ve done anything inherently bad or weird to anyone that would have me being ghosted by people I’ve been best friends with my entire life but for months now it feels as though everyone in my life, both old and new, is avoiding me as if I have 100 red flags on my head. All I’m asking is for some simple communication and for someone to give a fuck about me to check up every now and then. I’m not a boring or rude person. I care very deeply about the people in my life. It just hurts, you know? Why am I not enough? What else can I do? I feel absolutely desperate and it’s really starting to affect my life. I feel like the people I’ve always been there for are not giving me same energy now that I need it. My cup is empty and I’m trying to fill it on my own but it feels like there’s a hole at the bottom.

I recently got a restaurant job through a relatives friend. I realized how slow and useless I am. I can't do fast pace work and my anxiety and panic attacks are coming back (and it's just been 4 days of work). I started crying again every night these past few days and think to myself ""I want to die"" repeatedly for hours before going back to work again. After a year of being a shutin and wasting thousands of my single mom minimum wage money for me to get better is also adding to my anxiety. The relatives friend will also be in trouble for hiring me with no experience if I don't do well. I just am really incompetent who can't do easy work.  I was wondering if there is a way to get a slow pace job with no experience or degree right away so I can move out and stop being a burden. I was also thinking of running away and be homeless (I know I will suffer especially when its winter soon and won't help my depression but atleast I won't be a burden and will suffer alone instead of affecting everyone bringing them down with me.) I was going to commit suicide but knowing my mom will kill herself if I do has made me to instead to seek advice on the internet.

I'm tied of feeling like I'm being taken advantage of.   He has been unemployed nearly our whole relationship. He has had two jobs, each lasting no longer than 3 months. It has really taken a toll on me. He doesn't try to look for jobs. He doesn't help out around the house, apart from occasionally doing dishes, while I'm working full time/occasional overtime to pay for everything.  I have to beg him to help out around at home, only to get endless empty promises. Enough to give me hope, only to leave me disappointed and hurt when he inevitably doesn't follow through on his word.   I used to chalk it up to his ADHD. I felt sympathetic, because I struggle with mental health and know what it is like to be unemployed. But I'm starting to realize this is a huge problem and his condition cannot be used as an excuse anymore. I do not see the effort and all I hear is excuses. How can he see me work so hard to provide for us and sit on his ass all day?   To make things worse, he tore his ACL recently and has been using it as an excuse to not look for jobs (let's be honest, he wasn't going to look for jobs anyway). Now I would feel horrible ending things while he has $0 to his name and an injured leg.   But I can't keep caring. Look at where it has gotten me.  I've been able to procrastinate taking action because I've been so focused and burnt out from my work, but it feels like things are coming to head and I can't keep ignoring it. I don't talk to anyone about this because it's so embarrassing, which is so isolating.   I'm so scared of what my future looks like, even though I know there are better days ahead. I'm mourning all the time I've wasted on this relationship that is going nowhere.   I wonder if anyone can relate or have any words of wisdom/encouragement. But ultimately I'm just venting.

I’m not fishing for a diagnosis I’m looking for better answers because anxiety and depression and my own life choices has ruined who I am as a person and sometimes it’s feels to big to just “depression and anxiety”.

1nneef4,1758520022,2025-09-22T05:47:02Z,offmychest,Confused where I stand in this relationship,"I’m really confused about my relationship right now. My girlfriend and I have known each other for around eight years. She’s a bit anti-social, has anxiety, and usually prefers staying at home. Over time, we grew close, shared everything, and eventually fell in love. The problem is, we live on opposite sides of the same city and don’t meet often. Recently, we planned a trip with some friends. Everything was set, but one of the girls (let’s call her X), who’s very close to my girlfriend, had to drop out due to family issues. After that, my girlfriend also told me she couldn’t make it. When I asked why, she gave me an excuse that didn’t seem very convincing. I couldn’t help but feel she dropped out just because X wasn’t going. This has happened before too, since she’s generally more comfortable with her female friends. I’ve tried moving on from her, telling her I want to live a life without this cycle, but she won’t let me go. When I confronted her about canceling, she turned it around and said she’s scared of my reactions. To be fair, I’ve reacted impulsively in the past! like the time she backed out of a trip after I had already booked tickets and made plans. The thing is, trips matter to me because I’ve been feeling emotionally drained from work and was looking forward to them as a break. Whenever she needs me, I’m always there, but when I need her, she’s unavailable usually because she avoids her phone or social situations. This left me feeling so unsupported that I even had to start therapy. Now I’m stuck wondering: do I stay and take the blame for everything, or do I walk away? Because at this point, it feels like all she does is blame me for my reactions, while I believe my reactions are simply responses to her actions.  PS: I want to move on because I’ve already crossed into my 30s, and the pressure from my family is immense. At the same time, I love her with all my heart, and that’s what makes me so confused about what to do.",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nneef4/confused_where_i_stand_in_this_relationship/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nneef4/confused_where_i_stand_in_this_relationship/
1nng7wv,1758526903,2025-09-22T07:41:43Z,offmychest,"I ruined my relationship, I hate myself","Idk how to start this, it's such a long and complicated story. I guess I'll go all the way back to the beginning... My ex and I met in summer school when we were 17, we were together for 8 years. Our relationship was far from perfect, many mistakes or poor choices led to distrust between us but I believe the love and connection was real, because it haunts me.   Her dad was always an obstacle, early in our relationship he would try to convince her to leave me without even trying to get to know me himself, sometimes she would give in and break it off, only for us to talk it out and stay together. I'd get upset when she wouldn't defend me and fold to his demands. One time I overheard him on the phone with her saying I was a loser stoner, I blew up and challenged him to say it to my face. My reaction scared the shit out of her. That was the first time I recall my temper dividing us. Before we got together, she was talking to someone long distance, I assumed she stopped when we got together but that wasn't the case. It's been so long now since then I don't remember how it played out, but I recall being disappointed and she was embarrassed. Things like this occurred from time to time in our relationship, I'd get angry about something inappropriate she'd do, she'd get scared, leave, come back, I'd find out she was talking to somebody, get angry, rinse and repeat.   Since I was very young I'd been aware of porn and over the years developed an addiction to it, so by the time we were together I had a problem controlling my lust, I'd watch porn and follow thirst traps. I introduced her to porn and although she tried to embrace it with me, she said it made her uncomfortable, and over the years she would set different boundaries for what she was comfortable with me looking at if at all. I would argue with her that looking wasn't wrong but interacting with them is, and since she had talked to other guys she had no right to tell me that what I was doing was wrong.   In 2018 she went to visit her mom who lived farther up north from us, and ended up moving in with her to get away from our unhealthy dynamic. We stayed in contact and eventually I convinced her to come back. In 2020, we were living together and I slapped her during an argument, that was the first time and unfortunately not the last. Over time, the physical stuff got worse, I'd push, choke, and slap her very aggressively during fights. She left again in 2022, and came back after more convincing and promises that things would be different... But they weren't, I made no real attempt to get healthier, I also began self harming around this time too. We explored polyamory together from 2022 to 2023 and had a few short term GFs, but towards the end of 2024 she didn't want to do that anymore and that made me angry. I was so selfish to demand that we continue such an unethical dynamic, especially when we still weren't healthy.   November 2024 I started training at a boxing gym, on my 2nd day she leaves after another argument that threatened her safety, she changed her number and cut me off completely besides email for formal things like items she left behind that she wanted delivered to her dad. At this point I swore to myself on everything that I'll be a better man no matter what, I quit smoking, I quit porn, I went to therapy, and I trained hard at the gym. During this time, I went to give one of my friends all my weed and smoking stuff, while at his apartment complex, I saw my ex's car parked there, I knew it was her car and I asked my friend if she was around, he said they still saw each other at card night (she played cards with his friends) but denied that it was her car, gaslit tf out of me. She emails me that night saying she carpooled with a friend to church and that's why it was there. My dumbass gives her the benefit of the doubt but still something feels fishy, so one day after work I slide by his apartment to see if her car's still there and low and behold it is. I bang on his door and his roommate answers, I beg for the truth and he tells me she keeps her car there so I wouldn't think she's at her dad's and try to harass her. I sorta buy that and then my friend comes walking up from the pool, I asked him why he lied and he basically tells me to fuck off. I was so hurt and confused.   January 2025 I'm the best version of myself. I stayed consistent in everything I swore I'd do to change, I have a positive mind set above the universe, I'm healthy, calm, and confident. I had 2 GFs, and made amends with friends and family I fell out with. Jump back to Christmas time real quick, she emailed me saying she had left a gift in the garage she had gotten for me before she left, so I go digging in the garage and find it, a 60th anniversary edition of fahrenheit 451, a book that was at the top of my reading list but I didn't have a copy til then. Receiving that gift was like how John Wick must've felt when he received the puppy from his dead wife, a final gift to help cope with the grief. I wanted to reciprocate the gesture and had intended to get her something she really wanted before we'd broken up, it was expensive, and I didn't want her to think I was trying to win her back with gifts, I honestly didn't care if she came back or not I just wanted to give to her without expectation, I wanted to love selflessly, so I ordered her gift but unfortunately it didn't come til after Christmas.   Ok back to January she emails me saying she wants me to give her a few more of her things and we can meet at Starbucks. I haven't seen her in almost 3 months, I'm so excited and nervous. We meet, talk, catch up for a little, I learn that she's following Orthodox Christianity now (we were both agnostic), and I give her the gift, she was in awe that I had remembered and gone through with getting it despite the circumstance. She adds me on Snapchat and we start talking again and making plans to hangout. During one hangout she tells me she had planned to kill herself one day while on acid on a solo hike but didn't while we were still together, her telling me that breaks me, I don't want her to die! She's so talented, passionate, and ambitious and I want her to live to fulfill her potential! I sob and apologize profusely for the abuse I put her through, she tells me she forgives me. On another hangout we make a grocery store trip and I buy her flowers spontaneously and surprise her with them in the car, she holds my hand and tells me it's providence that we reconciled.   I'm floating on air. It feels like all my hard work, positivity, and commitment to change is paying off! I'm at a going away party for my friend who is going into the army when he tells me that my ex had been sleeping with my friend whose apartment I saw her car at. BAM, the air I'd been floating on deflates from under me. I knew she slept with someone during our time apart and somehow made peace with it but learning it was him completely devastated me. I may not have always been good to my girl, but I was always good to my boys. I let him crash with me when he was homeless for months, let him have my bed while I slept on the couch, helped him move his things in and out of storage units and into the rooms or the apartment he'd rent. I was a good friend, and he lied to my face and told me he didn't want her and that he was gonna help me get her back. I knew I couldn't trust a man around her, she's very attractive, but I figured I could trust her because no way she'd go for him, he's twice our age, fat, hairy, and gross. I couldn't believe she'd do that. I confronted her about it the next time we hung out and she initially denied it until I told her that the friend group told me and she was extremely embarrassed. Turns out she'd been living with him and only hmu once she moved out, said she felt immense guilt and regret for it. All I wanted was to be with her, I had broken up with my other GFs to be with her again, and I knew I had hurt her so many times it was only fair that she gets to hurt me too, but damn, she hurt me. I was no longer the only man she had ever been with and it had to be with one of my friends of all people! This destroyed me emotionally, tho it took time to surface.   February we are together again, I find out she's been planning to join the air force and we start talking about getting married so I could go with her when she gets stationed. She even buys my ring first. I'm so excited but still hurt from what she did, and as time progresses I become more and more insecure about it and start arguing with her. The arguments aren't the same as they were, I make sure not to be physically intimidating or verbally abusive, but I am angry and loud. I cried more than anything, and eventually I became severely depressed. I snooped her Instagram stories from while we were apart and saw she put me on blast for the abuse I put her through, and some of her followers responses congratulating her for leaving, I feel humiliated when I discover this and fear that I'll never outlive the image of an abusive spouse. I felt like a monster and a loser, I hurt my girl, been betrayed, and outted for the fucking jerk that I was to her, I had woven together such an ugly web of events. At this point it all becomes too much and I tell her that I want to commit suicide, I feel like the weight of my sins is too heavy so to speak. She asks me if I wanted her to do it with me to which I initially say no, but later change my mind thinking it would be romantic to die together, that way no one can hurt us anymore. I don't need anyone to point out how stupidly ironic and insensitive that thought process is, but this is how low and lost I feel at this time. She tries to convince me that getting married and seeing our lives through is still worth it. I try to embrace her POV but struggle everyday all throughout the day. I can't stop thinking about what I lost rather than what I have, and she notices my distant gaze and promises me she will never leave me again.   March, we'd been seeing a couples therapist since back together per my recommendation, but in our last session I was so depressed I couldn't communicate it, so our therapist decided my case was beyond her capabilities and decided to let us go. We go out of state on a vacation where I propose to her and she says yes. Even with that glimmer of hope, I still consider suicide as an option, at this point she becomes emotionally exhausted and angry with me. A couple days after we get back home she runs out on me again and leaves the ring behind. A couple weeks go by and we meet so I can give her her things again, where I apologize for the suicide pact and ask her if we can salvage this, she agrees on the terms that I seek help for my mental health to which I agree, but she doesn't want to move back in with me. I get an appointment to see a psychiatrist and take her to one of my favorite restaurants I'd go to as a kid. When we get home I talk about how I'm disappointed she deleted our pictures of us and I try an app on her phone that could recover them, she starts freaking out because she's worried that it would recover an explicit video she made with my friend while they were together. I'm upset to find out she allowed him to record that but I assure her I'm not going to let it affect me. We start talking about her and him again and the whole conversation makes me insecure and so I start begging her to move back in because it's important to me that we move forward in our relationship rather than take steps back. I beg and pressure her to the point that she's done and she runs out of the house while I was distracted.   I saw her once more on Easter because her dad invited me to brunch with them, where she told me she doesn't like me anymore, I offer friendship and she initially accepts, but changes her mind the following week for no apparent reason and blocks me on everything. Her birthday was coming up and I wanted to celebrate it with her so bad, but she didn't allow that. Everything started to become too much again, I quit my job, quit the boxing gym, quit therapy, quit medication, started smoking weed and watching porn again. I'd constantly email her begging to let me fix things, she'd either ignore the emails or respond harshly. She left her cat she had since freshman year of highschool behind and I had to put her down in July because she had cancer, it was so hard, I loved her kitty and I wanted my ex to be there for her in the end, I reached out to her dad and gave him the vial of fur the vet gave me as a token of remembrance. I didn't stop trying to reach out and kept begging for reconciliation so eventually she filed a restraining order on me, and she has a new man now.   All I've done since about April is sob uncontrollably, play video games, watch tv with my dad, freak out on my dad because I can't handle my own emotions and he tries to comfort me the best he can but I'm just such a fucking mess, and play some board/card games with my mom. Besides maybe some ""quality time"" with my parents I've wasted all this time. I have spent some time with the only 2 friends I have left as well, but it feels hard to find something to talk about, I'm not passionate or interested in the things I used to be anymore so conversation feels hard and for a while I didn't talk to anybody at all because of what that guy did with my ex, it made me paranoid that nobody is really my friend and everybody would switch up on me, and who wouldn't? I'm a woman abuser.  I don't deserve loyalty or respect. I'm embarrassed, disgusted, and ashamed of myself. I look back on each time I lost my temper and I don't understand why I hurt her like that. It's not even something I condone.   Anyway I know the way I told this story makes our relationship sound terrible since I'm only describing the bad parts. But I can't stress enough how much love was really there between us. We made some beautiful memories together. I love her so much, I wish to reconcile and continue to grow together because I love her beyond description, I could make a whole post in itself about why I love her, and I know that nobody could love her more than me. We met each other so young and got to grow together for longer than most people that age do, you can't replicate that time with someone else because that time is gone, that's our bond, and I don't want to break that bond! I'm so ashamed of the ways I hurt her and caused this mess, it's all my fault, I let resentment between us build to a boiling point. I've cried everyday since she's been gone, no exaggeration.   I'm not religious but I pray, study manifestation and research basically anything I can use to try and get her back. I know everyone is going to tell me to just let go and move on but I really wish there was a way to undo or fix this mess I made of such an otherwise great relationship. I'm afraid this is it tho, and I feel like such a terrible person, I can't live with this outcome, being separated from my love. I hurt my beautiful girl and I'm so ashamed! I'm so sorry my love, I want it to be us so fucking bad! This can't be how things end! Fuck that! We deserve to be happy together, we loved each other. I don't want to live without her, I feel like I can't do it again, everyday apart from her has been agony and hollow and it's not getting any easier. I don't want to lose her, not after everything we shared! I wish I could take back all the hurt I caused her, I wish I had been a better partner, I wish she could trust me again. I'm so ashamed of how I failed her. I feel like such a piece of shit, I'm afraid I'll never be anything more than an abusive ex to her, I wanted to be her hero and instead I became her monster.   I'm 26 and I'm so afraid of living the rest of my life without her, it sounds so scary and sad. All I really want out of life is a partner to share adventures and make memories with, and when I got to know her all I wanted was for it to be her. I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her but I always clung to my addictions and let my insecurities about it flare up into something hostile and ugly instead of making that sacrifice for her when it could've saved our relationship. Idk if I should make another attempt to be better or just crash out and kill myself but I'm leaning towards the ladder because the intensity of my thoughts is too painful to keep enduring, my younger self would be so disappointed in me. My current self is disappointed in me. I feel like everyone is disappointed in me. I'm afraid to tell people these things and be labeled a bad person, but what else do you call someone that hurts who they love like that? I fucked up, I'm so sorry for how I fucked up, I regret my actions so much I'm not sure if I can live with them anymore.",2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nng7wv/i_ruined_my_relationship_i_hate_myself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nng7wv/i_ruined_my_relationship_i_hate_myself/

My ex and I go to the same university so I still see her while she makes me feel awful in here presence. Turned our friends against me, I feel like an outcast. She broke up with me, for her reasons that I find stupid for anding a 3 yr relationship. Anyway, I fell my exams now and I feel so much pressure from it. My friends, fami always have some sort of impossible expectation. I know these are not that big of a deal problems but I just cant cope. These final exams kept me in my room for months and just not to pass them in the end. I cant sleep at night. The third thing is anxiety that follows me everywhere I go, in simple interactions, feeling like im overlyjudged. I wish I can just move places for a while.

1nnh0tl,1758530134,2025-09-22T08:35:34Z,offmychest,I don’t like my best friend,"I’ll try to summarize, but it might be hard. Overall, I think I’m kind of “outgrowing” my best friend and I can’t handle it. I need to get things off my chest, to vent and get advice. I have a terrible chaos inside me. This will be a long post, so as I write it my frustration and bad emotions will build up. Right away I want to say that X is not a bad person. Despite how she sometimes behaves, I have never thought she was trying to hurt me on purpose. If I had felt that some things were intentional, it would be much easier for me to set boundaries. Some context: we’ve known each other for 9 years. I live in Krakow, she lives in Madrid. Strangely enough, the fact that this is a long-distance friendship works very much in its favor, but more on that later. I was always quite a lonely teenager, and then a lonely adult. I had my partner and her. For her it was similar. The fact that in terms of friendship we only had each other worked a bit like glue. Some time ago, however, I started therapy, overcame social anxiety, and opened up to people. It’s still not a big circle, but I’ve gained enough wonderful people around me that it changed my expectations about friendship. Something like: “it can be different.” Recently I realized that this isn’t an equal friendship. She is the kind of person you can’t really tell anything to. She becomes defensive or brushes me off with denial. For me that’s often the end of the conversation. I love her and she really gets a big discount from me. I mentioned earlier that the fact that there’s a big distance between us works in favor of this relationship. When we do see each other, it’s usually a few days staying at her place or mine. And I’m not exaggerating when I say it sucks every bit of energy out of me. After literally every one of those visits I need to recover in bed (that’s also why my partner doesn’t like her). I feel like our friendship runs on rules I have to follow. When we spend time together, even taking out my phone to reply to my fiancé sometimes results in a lecture about how I don’t respect her or our time together (I’ll skip the fact that she does the same and I never minded). And keep in mind these aren’t just coffee meetups – these are several days of being together 24/7, when my contact with my partner is limited because otherwise I feel her irritation. I won’t hide that it irritates him too, because he doesn’t know what’s happening to me. I don’t know if this is an important detail, but it drives me crazy. Especially considering that when I once told her it never bothered me that she texted her boyfriend a lot while at my place (even while talking with me), she answered, “I didn’t notice that I did that.” I didn’t even continue the conversation because I know her and didn’t see the point. I just wanted to have a nice evening. Now she’s pushing for another trip together, and I want to tear my hair out just thinking about it. Because what I described above is really just the tip of the iceberg. Speaking of trips – we’ve had a few, and I don’t think I ever came back happy or rested. And before I go further, here’s another important bit of context: X is autistic. Many things aren’t under her control, which is why it’s so hard for me to set boundaries. One of the (seemingly) minor problems she has is that she forgets to eat. If I don’t remind her, she becomes awful to me. We have to drop everything immediately because she needs to sit down and eat as soon as possible. In the meantime she’ll talk to me in a commanding tone, raise her voice, or tell me to be quiet. Honestly, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard “stop talking” in a raised voice and then just trudged behind her for 20 minutes until she ate. I don’t think she’s ever apologized. If it were anyone else, I’d probably immediately say they’re not allowed to speak to me like that. With her I somehow can’t do it. On the other hand, she doesn’t have a problem calling me out. And here’s another example of a situation where I think, “this isn’t how it should be.” Because she won’t just point something out – she’ll flat out scold me. And in a way, I understand the need, but once would be enough. Instead, I get half-hour lectures, and I take them very much to heart. A situation from last month went like this: X was having a really hard time – her boyfriend broke up with her, she lost a friend, and got fired. A terrible time. She didn’t really tell me much about it, she wasn’t very open. Unfortunately, I’m short-sighted and measure others by my own standards. When things are bad for me, everyone around me knows not to bring up the topic until I do – otherwise it makes it worse. And you can already guess what I did. I assumed that as long as everything was fresh, I wouldn’t bring it up and I’d wait until X wanted to talk – but at the start I did text her that I was there for her anytime if she wanted to talk. I was surprised when a few days later at night I got a long message saying that I wasn’t being supportive, that I wasn’t showing her care, and that I had failed her as a friend. Say what you will about me, but I’m not stupid – I immediately realized what I did was absurdly dumb. I explained where it came from, promised to do better, and sincerely apologized. The conversation about me (combined with her nitpicking my words) lasted 40 minutes, during which all I did was apologize. Because I didn’t know what else I could do – I won’t argue with someone I’ve hurt. And so everything started building up in me. The lack of healthy communication, putting my needs aside, lack of respect (I don’t know how else to call being spoken to in a raised, commanding tone), and other little things that are basically petty but add up. I don’t know how to put it – I love her, but I think I stopped liking her. She brings a lot of negative energy into my life, and I’m no longer able to handle it and just keep biting my tongue. At the same time I get tears in my eyes when I think about hurting her. A big part of it comes down to her being autistic. Sometimes she lacks empathy, doesn’t really regulate her emotions. It’s not really under her control. I know other people have left her because of this, and I’ve seen her heart broken and her blaming herself more than she should. I don’t want to be another one who leaves, but I’m realizing that if I want to take care of myself, I need to step back. I know that soon I’ll either become spiteful or start picking fights to sabotage the relationship. I don’t want that and I need to ground myself. Because again – she is not a bad person. She is insanely ambitious, educated, and probably the funniest person under the sun. I don’t know how I’ll manage without her in my life, but I can’t take another trip after which I feel relief going to the airport. I feel like a terrible person, but I think I’m slowly reaching my limits.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnh0tl/i_dont_like_my_best_friend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnh0tl/i_dont_like_my_best_friend/
1nnimof,1758536239,2025-09-22T10:17:19Z,offmychest,I don’t enjoy doing anything,"I guess there’s something wrong with me. I do not WANT to do anything. Not even “fun” things. Not in a “I’m lazy” way, I get my shit done, but what I mean is- I don’t have hobbies, I don’t look forward to things, I don’t have friends that I actually hang out with, and most of all, I’m not happy.   I’m a female in my 20s, I’ve always been “successful” in the eyes of society, so it makes me feel guilty that I’m not happy. I have a good job, a good family, I’m physically healthy, I have good self esteem (like I don’t hate myself or think I’m ugly or fat or undeserving of love or happiness or whatever other common issues ppl have with themselves). I’m intelligent, money is not an issue thanks to my job, I lack significant trauma in my life, and I really don’t have any bad habits such as smoking or drinking. But honestly sometimes I wish I DID do those things so there was at least SOMETHING I enjoy or something to relate with other people. I just feel like I don’t belong here.  I am familiar with the term anhedonia which is pretty much what I’m describing. I’ve been through 5 or so therapists, i haven’t felt any progress was made in any of it. I’m on 2 antidepressants, they’ve certainly helped my anxiety but my depression not quite.   I pretty much have an aversion to the things I USED to like (playing piano, going to the gym, hanging out with friends, painting, soccer). Those things now just feel draining and frustrating. All I do is exist and check boxes. When I’m off work, I don’t really have anything that I want to do. I don’t like extrovert things like partying, bars (don’t drink at all). I also don’t like introvert things like movies, gaming, books, YouTube, hiking, or any of the things I’ve ever been offered as an idea. I just. Don’t. Enjoy. Anything. On my days off I try to sleep as much as I can so I can avoid being conscious.   I’m not suicidal either. So like my problem isn’t really a “PRESSING” issue, or one that there are fleshed out paths to recovery for, so I’ve felt at a loss for some time now.   Based on what I’ve described, i know I sound like (and trust me, feel like) I’m just ungrateful and it’s my fault that I’m not happy. People would kill for my position. But man there’s definitely something up with my brain.   I have all the tools. But something isn’t working, and unlike most cases, I cannot identify a problem. Where the hell do I start trying to be happy when there’s nothing about my life to “fix”. I’m not happy, I don’t appreciate life, but I don’t have a good reason for it.   I don’t really think anyone knows this about me. I’m a well-liked person I think, I lay low, am unproblematic, go with the flow and cover up my dissatisfaction well. I don’t think I can live a full life feeling this empty inside. Constantly trying to avoid the pain of existing is too exhausting to do forever. What the hell do i do? I feel like ive tried all the normal things like meds and therapy and journaling, meditation.   Just a rant I guess.

1nnj0lt,1758537609,2025-09-22T10:40:09Z,offmychest,I finally enjoy living and look forward to the future,"I want to start off with saying I’m not on Reddit often and I’m quite a lurker. But, today I really feel like sharing a bit of my life and I have very few people in my life who can share this with. While this does include my mental health, this isn’t for advice and I unfortunately am undiagnosed since I’ve been too scared to get it official I guess, but again please, no advice. This is just me wanting to share a piece of myself on the internet.  TLDR: had hard knock life, was angry and sad, worked hard to be nice, had 2 kids, was less angry and sad, worked harder to be nice, separated with ex, worked on self and found someone make happy, working mega hard on goodliness, got happiness, working on future with wife and blended family   (Sorry in advance if this sounds vague at times, words are difficult right now and I want to avoid being recognized by people I no longer wish to see or speak to. Obligatory - 25 M)  As a kid and teen, I had struggled mentally with a difficult upbringing. The amount of times I’ve been used, or let down have left me with issues I still shake uncontrollably over. Coupled with a strong yearning for a family of my own, and a very chaotic and unstable home. It resulted in years of anger and confusion that left me spiraling in a state of anxiety, frustration and sadness. Every day felt like a blur and constantly had panic attacks over not being able to even remember the previous day.  Simply put I finally know I had been in a dissociative state for most of that.  When I was around 15-16 I finally realized how angry I had become. Sadness was the only word I really could find at the time for something I later learned was depression. I really wanted to be a better person and not let small things get to me like my family did. I didn’t want to hurt the ones I care about, whether that was physically or with words. I wanted people around me to feel safe, cared for and loved.  So, I started working on myself, little by little. I was rude, disrespectful, quick to anger for no reason. At first I backpedaled a lot and found it hard to make any real progress on myself when I’d be belittled for “finally trying after all these years” (I was a teenager and had bad role models, so like fk you too ig?) still, after working hard and finding friends that would be honest with me I made real progress in being kinder.  By the time I was about 18 I was still very angry and still letting myself trust people I shouldn’t. Got myself hurt, used some more and resented by those who I refused to forgive. I started getting myself out of the cycles that got me angry in the first place. Stopped letting peoples’ words affect my actions as much, but still had a lot of growth to do.  By the time I turn 21, I made enough mistakes in 3 years that I’m still dealing with consequences of. 2 of which are my favorite mistakes I’ve made and am doing everything I can to be a good father to them. They didn’t ask to be here and man are children great motivators to wanna be a better person. Soon enough though, my ex and I split. It was for the best of our children. I still had shortcomings I still needed to fix and was so scared of therapy I hadn’t given it any real thought till this point.  When I turned 22 I was really trying hard to make progress on how to be more attentive, remember information better and get my reactionary anger under control. Around this time I met my partner (now wife) who was going through her own things. Ultimately, I wanted to take a relationship slow with her. I didn’t want mess anything up and or hurt her. Thankfully for me she’s been the most headstrong, yet patient woman I’ve met. We were both at rocky points in our life and had no business being in relationships but we somehow made it work. After things going way faster than either of us planned or anticipated, we met each others kids. From there we continued seeing each other and planning things for not just us but also the kiddos.  As the relationship developed along we kept each other accountable, called out each others BS. But most importantly, we listened to each other. Yes, we cried, we got mad, we’ve even yelled. But, as time has gone on and we both have gotten into therapy, our issues started to dissolve by the time we were 2 years into our relationship and genuinely let our guard down. It’s always been us vs the problem, even if one of us was the one causing it.  Around a year ago, I finally had the means to move out of my mothers house and in with my girlfriend; at the same time things were finally culminating to a boiling point with my family that I couldn’t handle anymore and part of it was the way they were treating my partner, part of it was not wanting my children to think the way they behave is appropriate or okay. I finally put my foot down and cut them off for good. Things were finally starting to settle down for me once I didn’t have the stress of ultimatums constantly thrown at me and judged for every action I made. A decision was finally made and I could breathe better for it.  While life itself was rocky to say the least, I finally landed a temp job I really liked and was working hard to get a full time position. So, while doing my best to balance work, kids between 2 homes and a partner I was growing in love with by the day, things were looking up.   Without getting too specific cause at this point I feel like If a family member that I cut off read this, they’d know who I am. So, with that out of the way. Despite, chronically feeling numb or low, I can say for certainty that I’m finally enjoying life, I look forward to tomorrow, I look forward to going to work, I look forward to doing something mundane as the dishes. I look forward to the future my wife and I are trying so hard to build so our kids don’t struggle the way we have. Emotionally or physically.   I can’t see myself ever doing this with anyone else. She’s my rock, my ear, my recharge when I’m feeling low. She knows how to help when I’m overwhelmed. She’s my very breath most days when I’m struggling. She’s the very thing giving me motivation and strength. I really love her with every fiber of my being, she’s so smart, beautiful and is so caring. If I keep going we will be here for another 10,000 words. I just hope that as much as you say it baby, I really hope I am everything you’re to me. Cause, I’ll keep working everyday to be the man we both want me to be.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnj0lt/i_finally_enjoy_living_and_look_forward_to_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnj0lt/i_finally_enjoy_living_and_look_forward_to_the/

I was removed from my home, taken to court, had a restraining order placed against me and made to feel like a monster. I made a plan to end my life, I was broken.

My team’s season came to an end and I got upset. I yelled at the tv. My wife grabbed my son and ran out of the room. She came back a short time later accusing me of domestic abuse and saying she didn’t know next time if it would be her or our son that I was yelling at. Keep in mind we have never ever been in a situation anyone would define as being abusive. I became highly triggered by this and left the house.

On the outside I'm the total opposite of what someone with depression looks like. Conventionally attractive, great job, great friends, pretty close to my family, a big, bubbly personality, the works. But I had a terrible childhood, suffered physical, mental and emotional abuse from my father, loved my mother with all my heart and she tried her hardest to protect me but was too passive and docile to do much and a times was just as bad as everyone else with her cruel words and blaming me for what I went through. I was labelled as the problem child at home and at school, told what a horrible, nasty and obnoxious person I was, mistreated by friends and family alike and scapegoated to excuse my fathers abuse because in our culture a child doesn't challenge their parents, no matter how abusive they are. I can count on one hand how many people I had in my corner growing up and it wouldn't even use all the fingers on that hand. Ended up homeless as a teen, had a stillbirth at 18, my teens and early adult years were a blur of bad decisions, drugs, alcohol, anger, drama and depression. I've been depressed as long as I can remember, some of my earliest memories were crying on my bedroom floor praying for God to kill me.  I've turned my life around completely, built myself up from scratch for years and years no matter what obstacles I faced and I faced a lot, managed to forgive my siblings for their part in my abuse, people around me always tell me how strong I am, how resilient I am, how proud they are of me for coming so far from everything I've been through. But the truth is I wake up every day anxious, depressed, and crying. I cry every single day. My biggest regret in life is that the attempts I made on my life weren't successful and I'm still here. I've gone the full nine yards trust me, every single overdose I've had no matter how fatal or dangerous it should be has done absolutely nothing, even doctors have been shocked at me taking 20+ painkillers or other tablets and walking away with nothing more than some vomiting and aching, nothing long lasting or fatal (unfortunately). People say that this is a sign I'm meant to be here and keep fighting, but how do you keep fighting to be alive when you were taught for so long to hate yourself? My mum who was the only person I ever felt truly loved or saw me died recently and before she died she told me how she's always been so depressed and sad herself and it makes her sad that she sees so much of herself in me including this. I've tried therapy, counselling, medication, I exercise almost every single day, I'm fit and healthy, have an active social life, hobbies, everything. I do everything that's meant to be right but no matter what at the end of the day my mind tells me that I'm a horrible and evil person who deserves to die.",4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnk5ow/if_i_die_prematurely_it_will_be_at_my_own_hands/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnk5ow/if_i_die_prematurely_it_will_be_at_my_own_hands/

Around the age of 18, the symptoms worsened, I became increasingly lonely and depressed, I attempted suicide by cutting my arms but without having the courage to follow through. My mother discovered this and sent me to the psychologist and from there I began a journey with the psychologist which lasted something like 3/4 YEARS (the visits were free and covered by the Italian state) in these years we tried everything, years of therapy, hypnosis techniques, work on improving myself but nothing... I was also sent to the psychiatrist and I was given various drugs, I tried 3 and none of these brought positive changes... in fact in some cases they made things worse. I stopped going to the psychologist and psychiatrist because I had been going for too long and I think they ""got fed up and got rid of me"" at the first opportunity.

Throughout high school, I took every AP class I could, grinded constantly, and somehow made it here. I thought I'd feel accomplished, but honestly, I just feel exhausted and more lost than ever.  My entire life revolves around academics and ""career prep."" Beyond my regular coursework, I'm constantly doing side projects, grinding LeetCode problems for hours, contributing to open source repos, anything that might look good on a resume. I tell myself it's all for landing that dream job at Meta, Netflix, or some other big tech company.  But I'm starting to realize what I've given up. I have basically zero social life - I've made maybe one or two acquaintances since starting college, but no real friends. My social skills feel completely underdeveloped because I spent all of high school with my head buried in textbooks instead of learning how to actually connect with people. I'm lonely as hell.  My sleep schedule is a disaster. I'm lucky if I get 5-6 hours a night because I'm always working on something. I haven't exercised regularly in years. I eat like crap because I'm always rushing between assignments and projects. I can't remember the last time I did something purely for fun.  The worst part? With everything happening with automation  and all the layoffs in tech, those dream jobs I've been sacrificing everything for feel more and more out of reach. The market is brutal right now, and even people with way more experience than me are struggling to find work.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm completely delusional.

1nnnmp2,1758550457,2025-09-22T14:14:17Z,offmychest,I want to give up,"So, I just want support I guess. My therapist started an appointment once telling me that she was reading a book that if she didn't know better she would say I was punking her. Because it described my family to a T. (Adult Children of Emotionally Immature parents).  I'm (F33) emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. Last year, mid July, my husband (who is diabetic, M41) had a stress fracture in his right foot, 60% of his job was driving, so we went from a two income household with those bills, to a single income and short term disability that seriously had to rhyme or reason when it would show up. We kept him off his foot, I did everything, cooked, cleaned, took care of the animals, worked 40 hours a week, took him to all his appointments, stressed about money, etc.  We tried once asking my family for help, which resulted in my mother screaming at me for 20 minutes about how on earth I needed money, and I'm a disgrace, etc. Then my dad quietly gave me a couple hundred dollars to help (My mom has not worked in 40+ years and my dad is self employed. I would have taken any help, share food, help with laundry, help with animals, but no I got screamed at.)  So it was just us, his family lives 7 hours away and also hates us. We are the cycle breakers, and we're trying to build our own lives, but when you have been verbally and emotionally abused, it's hard making friends. We kind of cling to each other, which I guess is one of the problems that happens. Anyway, he stays off his foot for 8 weeks, goes back to work for a week, and then lets the dog out that weekend and he hears a pop, followed by pain. My man, he broke the fourth metatarsal on his right foot, at this point,  Another 4-8 weeks of staying completely off his foot, a few weeks in, his job fires him, so we are down to a single income household, trying to make rent, car payments, and his car gets repo'd because we just couldn't pay it. I think the only reason I survived this, was because in late August last year I was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive and started medication. Otherwise, I'm not sure I would have been able to do everything, because I did, he couldn't walk, I had to help him to the bathroom some days, take care of the dog and cat, do all the shopping, cooking, cleaning, working 40+ hours a week, use up all my time off for his appointments.  Then we get to 8 weeks post break and told he was going to need surgery, I am out of PTO, so we have to postpone it until January 2025 (this news was given mid November), so another 6-8 week recovery after surgery, my boss is getting annoyed with me because somewhere in all this I get the stomach flu and run out of PTO but because I'm salary, it ""looks bad"" that I'm getting non-paid time. He knows everything that is happening, I've worked at my job for 6 years at that point and never had PTO problems. But of course this is the fight he wants.  I had to use all my vacation for his surgery, going into work a few hours late, so I could help him get settled in the mornings. We are getting unemployment which is floating us a bit, but we're down to bare bones basics. I have several meltdowns, because this is the third round of everything being on me. And as a parentified child of emotionally immature parents, who's mom is borderline narcissistic, and the only girl in the house growing up, with religion being the focal point. I felt so -- drained, like I was 12 again, getting yelled at because I didn't empty the dishwasher when they wanted, failed a test in school, didn't get the boys dressed correctly, somehow dusted wrong. Yes I'm in therapy, and I made it through this time, but God, at some point I wasn't sure if I was going to end up in grippy sock jail, or something worse.  Finally, light at the end of the tunnel, he gets cleared in April, has a contract IT job lined up. Thank God. I'm out of time off, but my work has a thing where if you work over 40 you get time off banked, so I start doing that so I can take some time off later in the year so I don't go crazy.  You would think that's where this ends right? Wrong, by the end of June, turns out my husband's steel toed boots have worn a wound onto his middle toe on his left foot. He calls me after an appointment and tells me that he had two choices, hospital, or schedule surgery for amputation. (Side note, when I met my husband in 2016, his diabetes was not controlled well, but recent A1C was 5.9 so I'm thinking we're just dealing with the aftermath of it not being controlled). So there goes all my banked time off I've been accruing, he's in the hospital for 4 days, (still haven't seen the bill yet, j-j) and ends up getting it amputated anyway.  The kicker? They send him home with a PIC line, and I have to administer IV antibiotics every 6 hours for 14 days. While working 40 hours, taking care of the house, the dog, myself, and I don't have anyone to help me. Because one it's hard to ask for help, two, my family has proven unreliable (not just my parents), three, I don't have many friends and get afraid to ask all the time because as you've seen my timeline, my life just sucks.  It takes 6 weeks for this recovery, the two weeks of IV antibiotics were a blur because I got so little sleep. Every time I'd start to sleep, my alarm would go off, because of course they didn't put an extension on the PIC line so he could do it by himself. We finally got one after the dressing change a week into it, but I was still delirious.  During this time the contract work seems to be cool about everything, the contract even extends, and he goes back to work 6 weeks later. They extend a second time, and we finally feel like we're treading water instead of drowning. Then the 3rd deadline for the contract comes and they fire him at the end of the day. So now, we're back to a single income household. I can't make anymore money, I just don't have time, he'd trying to find a job but the market is the market. And I just -- I don't know what to do anymore.  He's become depressed, he has no friends but me and the animals, and this is another job that just let him go without any warning or information. So now we're drowning again, I don't know how we're going to pay rent this month, and I just --- I want my mom. But not MY mom, my dad died in March this year too, and my mom kept him from calling me during his last week, so I didn't get to say goodbye, because she and I were not talking and my dad was a doormat to her wishes.  I just want a parent to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay. Because right now, it's not okay, and I'm not okay, but I still have to sit here at work and pretend everything is okay for my boss and coworkers. Because heaven forbid anyone not be okay. and for this long.  If you've made it this far, please, tell me what to do? Tell me how I can survive, I just don't know what to do anymore. And I don't want to pile onto my husband, because I know he's looking for work, I know he's depressed. How do you deal with all this? When your circle is yourself, your husband and maybe one friend. Who you've asked far too much of, because she's the only one.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnnmp2/i_want_to_give_up/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnnmp2/i_want_to_give_up/

I understand that my situation may seem silly and unimportant to many people, and that I may not be a very nice person, but I just need to express what's been building up inside me.  For a long time, I felt hatred, disgust, and irritation towards other people. My girlfriend at the time was very abusive, and I also hated her. Looking back, I don't understand why I was with her in the first place. When I broke up with her, I didn't feel anything. It was the beginning of summer, and I wanted to have fun and meet new people. That's when I met a very nice girl. She seemed perfect in every way, but due to my self-doubt, I felt like she wasn't my level. Our communication was not close and we did not meet so often, but at one point, she wrote to me that she liked me. We started communicating and walking more actively, and eventually, after all her declarations of love, I gave up and confessed to her that the feelings were mutual. For the first time in a long time, I felt something good about another person. We spent the rest of July together, walking every day with her, often hugging, spending almost all the time together.  In August, she had to leave, but even so, we stayed in touch. I texted her every day, and we talked on the phone every day, watching TV shows and playing games. However, my anxiety began to worsen at the time. I often worried that she didn't miss me enough, that I wasn't important enough, and that she didn't love me as much as I loved her. I told her about my concerns, and she said that she was glad I was sharing my feelings with her, but that she felt uncomfortable with my unfounded anxiety. My anxiety was really unreasonable. In September, she finally came to the city, and we met in person. A day later, we met with a group of her friends, and I felt jealous. She spent a lot of time with them, making me feel unwanted, and she noticed my depressed state. When we said goodbye, she texted me that she wanted to take a break in our relationship because she had a lot of things going on, and my anxiety was really bothering her.   It destroyed me. I even thought about doing something stupid, but I tried to hold on, and I was helped by the hope that she would recover and everything would be fine between us. A couple of days later, she suggested that we break up. It's been about two weeks, and I'm still remembering everything that happened between us. The slightest thing brings back memories of her, and I know that she doesn't have any feelings for me anymore, but I still miss her. I understand that we can no longer be together, so I have stopped communicating with her and her friends, and I have returned her gifts, but I still often think about her and miss her. I often find myself thinking that no one will ever love me as much as she did, no one will ever say the things she said, and no one will ever hold me in their arms the way she did. In the end, no one will ever be as good as she was, and I have no one else with whom I share the memories I have with her.  I don't feel important. In my search for self-importance, I've often entered relationships that ended this way. But after these relationships, in addition to losing my sense of purpose, I feel like I've lost a very important person, and I don't know if I can love anyone else.

I'm a 20 years old student, and I feel like I'm drowning. For the last few months, my anxiety, which I've had since school, has gotten much worse. It's turned into a heavy depression that saps all my energy. I have to force myself to do basic things like shower or go to class. Most days, I just sit in my room with white noise on, trying to escape my own thoughts.  I feel trapped by my future. The thought of any job, even a simple one, fills me with dread. I don't believe I can be successful or capable. I feel like a failure before I've even started.  I know I'm lonely. I have a few friends, but I feel like a backup option to them. I know I need new connections, but the thought of meeting anyone new is terrifying. Even small interactions feel impossible.   The worst part is the hopelessness. I feel like no one can truly help me. I'm too scared and ashamed to talk to my parents or see a psychologist, even anonymously. Every thought about my life - studies, future, loneliness ends in tears and this crushing weight in my chest. It feels like everything is pressing down on me, getting heavier each day, and I have no energy left to push back.   On one hand, I've recently found something that feels like me. I write scenarios. It's my world, my voice. And I've started to genuinely like myself - my mind, my quirks, my body. Fragile feeling, but it's real.  But this is where the trap closes. This new-found self-acceptance is crashing into a terrifying fear of aging. The thought of getting older, of this ""me"" that I'm starting to appreciate changing, weakening, and eventually disappearing is causing me a kind of grief for a life I haven't even lost yet. It feels like a cruel joke: to finally like who you are, and to be acutely aware that it's all temporary.  I'm...just not sure what I'm asking for by writing this.

When I moved up to the standards that were critical to go to secondary school ( 4th spot..the 5th is the final level), I was not performing well. I was afraid , didn't like my teacher, I did not even know what to make of it. I had to reverse a level to retry. It was like a fear..I could not handle it. Thought of having no one to talk to as friends ( it was hard for me to do) ...my parents both worked...they did not have time for me. They eventually transferred me to another school. The same problem happened.. I did not like the teacher..too strict....fear..maybe I could not do the work because of that..I will not know. The situation kept on declining like that in a loop. Then finally I liked and was comfortable with a teacher doing the work well. Maybe he understood what was happening.    The other situation was overwhelmed when I was a teenager. My schedule after a typical school work week  was like this(extra lessons)..Mondays , I had maths, Wed  I had Physics, Friday I had Maths, Sat I had a higher form of maths, Sunday I had Chemistry. Never had a balance with work and play. So apart from work from school , u have to have your head on for the extra classes. It was soo hard to cope with the pressure, its like I have to face it on my own...that is life? Everyone seems normal.. and I am screaming inside for help with no one to answer. My passion for my hobbies like art and graphics, music , playing video games has always grounded me from thinking negatively. I eventually got a job by the grace of God that was related to what I loved doing. It was hard at first like an apprentice but when I actually settled down, its like I'm performing well in my own habitat. I made friends in the workplace because its easy to relate to what you love doing. At certain times what you do what you love becomes a chore when everybody overwhelms you ..like they want this done in a certain time frame...etc.I broke down and eventually they gave me a procedure to have enough time to work with so it would not be overbearing. After a few years I was let go by the company.I did not know how to react but I was comforted by my family by saying that I can freelance from home. I didn't have much worries from that period but when Covid hit , idk if my work got less to make me feel that I am not doing stuff that I love again. My music making got less. My creativity drive was none. I think I was depressed. My parents started to retire. They were home all the time. They force me to do things I did not like. I was irritated. I get anxious. Its like the first time I am around time and I can't handle them.( I never had a good relationship with time due to them working ever since)  Things started to open up after covid..I am getting same stuff that I sufferered as a child. I was trying to seek help for what it was. Could be trauma, not solving the problems I had ?Am I an introvert? I like being alone but when ur too alone it brings in depression mode. I rather be around ppl my age and likeness of hobbies.Narcassist? I was thinking that its my fault for being this way. Also I like to point out when I do from one tasks to another task , i feel like I am rushing and worrying. I worry for everything.I also lost weight in the pandemic. I panic alot. Seems like I does lose alot of energy . I have a high metabolism.Went by the docs..nothing wrong. feeling cold alot..nothing came up unusual. Maybe I don't like doiing chores? Makes me feel why I can't just do it like everybody else with no complaining? Feels like chores are just work and no reason. I always say where u get the energy to to all that? I does eat healthy but these days I have to eat more often before I panic and crash as if my sugar levels are low.I like being independent now but its like learning at my own pace and no one is pushing me to do it. Its a long road to recovery but idk where to start.

I have regressed so much and I feel stuck.  I have had issues with money management, and even after cutting expenses and downloading free budget apps I still can’t account for a couple hundred. It’s unfair.   I can’t do my job well. I have issues at my job that people a few months in don’t have. I have been talked to multiple times about my performance and I still can’t be trusted 100%. I heard I’m on thin ice but any effort just falls flat. I can’t do my job well to save my life and I hate my job.   I have a car loan that I have only paid the minimum towards. When a couple friends talked about it with one another, one said “That’s a mistake that he isn’t putting every extra cent into that loan.” Welp, yet another bad decision from me! I might as well dump every dollar I have into the loan from here on out!   Managing myself feels impossible. Some days I come home from work and sleep for 12 hours. I have no social life out here and drive to one friend an hour away every weekend just to talk to someone but they’re tired of them dealing with my problems. I thought I curbed that shit when I started therapy. Speaking of, i started going and I got called out for having an inexperienced therapist.   Everything I do is wrong. I am prone to making mistakes and bad choices and there is no getting out. I have always hated it but now I throw mini temper tantrums over every little mistake and my friend is over it.   And now I am about to pay rent towards my parents. Any chance of seeing that friend often is in jeopardy, alongside my mental health.   And no, I don’t believe there is much of anything out where I live where I can have a social life. Only in a city.   What the fuck do I even do about my situation and what the fuck do I even do about the temper tantrums? This is all impossible  Job market is shit. I may need a second job if i pay rent or move out.

1nnrx6n,1758560069,2025-09-22T16:54:29Z,depression,"I thought I was doing good enough at handling myself, but sometimes it feels unbearable","I don’t really have a question, I just need to vent somewhere people might understand.  With the years I’ve become really caring about myself, almost like a friend or therapist to myself. Therapy taught me habits and reflexes, to listen to what I feel, to journal, to let myself cry, to ask myself when I feel bad “what do you need right now?” Even if it’s irrational or childish, I’ll do it. Most of the time I find a balance between feeling and rationalizing, reminding myself that feelings, even when extreme, are just feelings and not the actual end of the world.  But lately it feels unbearable. I’m 21, just out of teenage years but I’ve always minimised my depressive episodes, telling myself “it’s fine, I’m young, it happens.” (Eventho I got diagnosed). Now that I’m older, experienced living alone with responsibilities, it felt like hell. This year especially, nothing has gone right. Before, when I messed up, I could tell myself it was laziness and I could fix it. My parents could yell at me, I’d know that deep down they were somehow right, and it was for the best.   But now it feels like even if I tried my hardest, my body is exhausted and my mind dissociated. Sometimes I feel so far from myself I can’t even tell what I’m feeling. Disappointment? sadness? anger? shame? It’s just a blur of negativity that I can’t untangle. And it makes me feel like shit because I feel useless, irresponsible, not what people want from me (parents, school etc). I wish I could do what i need to do, like a normal human. I know people are not gonna be like “it’s your fault, you’re guilty, look what you’re done” because when it comes to mental health they’re gonna ask “are you ok and do you need help” but to me I feel very angry at myself and wish I could do better.  I know I need professional help, but right now I don’t have money or time for therapy or meds. Last year I only saw a therapist once a month because I moved cities, which wasn’t enough. And now the idea of going out to see a doctor makes me cry, my social anxiety has gotten worse. Outside, my thoughts race: “am I walking too slow? am I bothering someone? are they noticing that I’m not okay?” After 30 minutes outside, I feel dizzy and sometimes faint.  I wouldn’t call this an emergency, when I hit panic mode I only think about death, and I’m not there right now. But I am on the edge. Writing this out feels like a small way to name it. And, I hate when people say “what about a hobby?” I have hobbies. I do things. But even when I do them I feel tired and disconnected.  So yeah, that’s all. I try to care for myself and most days it works, but sometimes it isn’t enough. And that scares me.  If you’ve read this, thank you. If you’ve been through this kind of dissociation or blur, it’d help to know I’m not alone.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnrx6n/i_thought_i_was_doing_good_enough_at_handling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnrx6n/i_thought_i_was_doing_good_enough_at_handling/

I, 27M, don't know when exactly I started being depressed, but I also don't remember a time when I wasn't. Something inside me has always felt... wrong, but has never really felt worth it to address. Tonight, I am finally having my first therapy session, but I still have mixed feelings.  A combination of feeling like I don't have anything external worth being depressed over, not putting effort into myself because I'm not worth the trouble, and practice masking due to neurodivergence hiding my pain from others has resulted in a decades-long feeling of malaise/apathy that has become intrinsic to my being. Even if I try getting out of it, I don't know who I am without it. There isn't another ""me"" that I'm trying to get back to, so I don't know what to strive for.  I have a good (albeit boring) job, I bought a house two years ago with my girlfriend, and I don't have any major health issues that I know of, nor any big psychological/sexual trauma. On paper, I should be happy, or at least not depressed. With everything going on in the world and so many people having less than me, it feels like I don't deserve to be depressed, nor do I deserve everything I have.  I'm only seeking therapy now because something has to change. I'm overweight, otherwise unhealthy, have dug myself into debt gambling because at least when I'm gambling I feel something that at least seems positive, and fear that as I sink further into my depression I'm going to drive away my long-term girlfriend, my parents, and the one other friend I've somehow managed to trick into sticking around. Despite them, I still feel alone, but I don't want to be truly alone.  I'm not suicidal, and never have been. I was hospitalized a few times as a kid due to emotional outbursts that got me put in for suicidal ideation, but I never meant it. I can't express enough that I DO NOT want to kill myself. However, I do want to be dead. Tragedies happen all the time to innocent/better people, and I often think it would be better for myself/others if I got t-boned by a truck or developed a rapidly deteriorating illness so this could be over and at least I could provide something of value in the form of my life insurance policy. I don't want to be hospitalized again for expressing this, but figure it has to come up in therapy at some point.  I'm sorry this is so long, I'll cut to the chase.  TLDR: I have my first therapy session tonight but I don't know how to approach it in a meaningful way that won't get me hospitalized and make everything worse. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnsj81/finally_seeking_therapy_but_still_struggling_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnsj81/finally_seeking_therapy_but_still_struggling_to/

Because of his fear of taking all the money, my mom tells me to take half the rent or even half of her pension which I don't want to.  I feel helpless. I can't do anything or if I try to fight he will take all anger on my mom when I am not there, he can break things like TV washing machine etc, which I bought for my mother or worse he can even try to harm my mom when I am not around. He has an extreme vengeful nature and often tells he is not afraid of going to the jail. When I confront him that I don't like how he talks to my mom he gets angry and is even more angry at my mom the next time when I am not around. He's a typical abuser, first he abuses, then later he says sorry and try to show love, care which I know is fake but my mom always forgives him.  He used to beat me and my mom but now as he grew up the beating has stopped and my mom is 65 year old now but he still emotionally abuses her. But due to all the beatings in the past both of us are somehow scared of him even when I don't show it I feel anxious around him. I had to deal with him all my life. I can't threaten him with police or he will do even worse things because he has nothing to lose he can break things, he can beat us once he comes back he will come to take revenge, and my mom will never let police get involve even if I try, she will bail him out and he is going to go after me and my things.  I don't talk to him much, I avoid and ignore him always, have my own room have created a safe boundary so he can't cross it, I don't even let him enter my room, I lock it when I go out. But my mom she just kept on taking the abuse and has normalise this behaviour. I don't blame her but I don't know what to do. Because of this I feel very unsure about my future, career and marriage.

Honestly I think it was my anxious attachment that had me so intrigued with him. Quite early on he tells me he’s fresh out of a 5 year relationship, I say how fresh? “Three weeks”.  I took a step back and dated some other people but he was stuck in the back of my mind and we loosely chatted. First date after a month, it’s amazing. But then the cracks start showing. He’s inconsistent, of course he is, he’s heartbroken. He doesn’t communicate a lot outside of heavy flirting. I get invested because he’s triggering exactly the right points in my attachment issues. I try to gain his attention, I want his validation, and he’s not giving it. He asks to see me, then doesn’t cancel until way too late and I ask him to confirm. Okay cool, he asks to see me again a week later. I say we’ll see about that. He shows up, I don’t know he’s feeling sick.  He gives me fucking strep throat, he comes back the next day and says he can’t afford condoms and he never needed them SO I PAY FOR THEM and then he ghosts me.  He ruined my whole week by making me sick, i lost money and missed out on a concert, on a birthday party and also a family visit that had been planned for months and it was spent with my relative hanging out at my place while I was feverish in bed for days.  Honestly I’d really prefer to laugh than to cry. All I know is if I was earlier in my healing journey I’d still be chasing him rather than cutting it off.  BUT I CANT. Because he ghosted me.

When I was 20 I got married with my husband (34m) and said him first minute into dating that I had mental health issues but he wanted to marry me anyway.   For almost all of our marriage of 12 years he never failed to express how annoyed he was with me being depressed. He always said that I have only negative thoughts or bad reactions to new things and that my fears are just in my head and I play victim.   Fast forward to yesterday when we started fighting for a misunderstanding. He told me that I’m an emotional terrorist, that for the past 12 years of marriage he was so unhappy with me and he was thinking about leaving me because of my depression for months now.   He said “We were young when we married, I thought I could manage stay with you even if you’re depressed but I just don’t want anymore, I can’t make your problems become my problems”.   So I’m now heartbroken, alone and scared. My family is not nearby and the most scary thing is that I don’t want to lose my dog. He’s everything to me!   My husband said that the puppy is ours so he’s going to stay with both of us alternately but I can’t live without him. In the span of a day I lost everything, the love of my life, my house, my puppy, and I feel like I’ve been such a burden and still am.. I still love him and I cannot stop crying and thinking that I will loose him, that he and my puppy are my life. What will I do with my life from now on?

This is going to sound stupid but hear me out.  I started playing this story-driven life sim a few months ago when I was stressed about work. Just needed something to unwind with at 2am when I couldn't sleep and didn't want to wake my girlfriend. It started innocent enough but I realized I was getting really invested in the narrative and the choices I was making. The game explores themes about identity, relationships, personal growth, even philosophical questions that I think about but feel too pretentious bringing up in real life.  My girlfriend saw me playing last week and asked about it. I showed her some of the storylines thinking she'd find it interesting or maybe even want to try it herself. Instead she got really quiet and then asked why I seemed more engaged with a game than with our actual relationship.  The thing is, she's not wrong to be hurt. Looking back at our conversations from the past few months, they're mostly logistics. Who's cooking dinner, what movie to watch, complaining about work, planning weekend stuff. When did we stop having real conversations? When did I start feeling like I couldn't explore deeper topics with her without it feeling forced or awkward?  In the game, there's no judgment for exploring different perspectives, no risk in being honest about doubts or fears. But that's also the problem right? Real intimacy requires risk. Real relationships involve the possibility of conflict and misunderstanding.  She says I'm escaping into a game instead of working on us. I think that's extreme but I can't completely dismiss it either. I've been more engaged with this narrative game in 3 months than I have with our relationship conversations in the past year. That's obviously a problem but I don't know if the problem is me, us, or just how relationships evolve over time.  We're trying to talk more now but it feels forced. Like we're both performing intimacy rather than actually connecting. She suggested couples therapy which I'm open to but part of me wonders if we're just incompatible in how we communicate. She needs external processing and immediate reactions. I need time to think through feelings without pressure to respond right away.  Has anyone else dealt with this? Not necessarily the gaming part but realizing you've stopped really talking to your partner? How do you rebuild that kind of openness when there's already hurt feelings and defensive walls up?  TL;DR: Been more engaged with a narrative game than conversations with my girlfriend, she found out and feels neglected, now questioning if we've lost the ability to really connect or if we were never that compatible to begin with.",8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnucsr/my_28m_girlfriend_26f_got_upset_that_ive_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnucsr/my_28m_girlfriend_26f_got_upset_that_ive_been/

My grandma didn’t know what it was but laughed because she knew I was freaking myself out and it made me mad that she was laughing but I was so scared and was super convinced that I had blue waffle or was about to catch it.  Anyways, that started my health anxiety and I’m just now getting better at controlling my anxiety when it comes to my health.  I remembered this just know and it’s now a funny memory. My grandma passed away two years ago and the amount of times I called her crying about me thinking I had something is a lot. Every time, she never made me more scared, she talked me down.

1nnwn3x,1758570662,2025-09-22T19:51:02Z,offmychest,Got a massive hyperfixation on my punk rock neighbor and I'm fully losing it. Need to vent...,"Okay, so I need to get this off my chest because my brain is in a permanent loop. I  have developed a SERIOUS hyperfixation on my neighbor (let's call him Egor, M16-ish). And I mean, the kind where you map out the acoustics of your apartment to find the spot where his guitar sounds the clearest. Yeah, it's that bad.  He's the epitome of a punk rock cliché in the best way possible: long black hair, always in skinny jeans and a leather jacket with a huge anarchy symbol painted on the back, and a cig in his hand. He plays electric guitar in his apartment (I live right above him) and sometimes sings with this raspy voice that just... does things to me. He's also ridiculously confident, like, walks like he owns the entire sidewalk.  Here's the catch: We've never actually spoken. We're just neighbors who don't even say hi. The only interaction I've ever had was when I was hanging out with a friend near his crew (our building has a huge group of like 50 kids that chill outside), and he did his thing where he shakes everyone's hand quickly before dipping to another part of the group. So yeah, I got a handshake. Don't @ me, it was a moment.  I'm the complete opposite of his vibe. I'm more of a pastel, artsy girl who draws anime sketches and plays piano. I'm like a pink marshmallow trying to befriend a black leather jacket. But I feel like we'd have common ground because we're both creative? I don't know, I'm probably just delulu.  The main issue is his friend group is massive and kinda intimidating. The one friend I have who's connected is friends with this girl who's a total pick-me gossip, so I can't really use that avenue without my business being everyone's business.    (Btw, I want to add that I remember him with short hair. About 6 years ago, when we were little, we went for a walk once. The only thing I remember is that we were scared by the closing door in the entrance because of the draft. And when he wanted to go home because he needed to pee, he wanted me to go first and say Ladies first""...😇😇)  So my plan is... to somehow magically become brave enough to just say ""hi"" to him when we pass each other. Maybe compliment his music. My brain has planned this out a thousand times, but my social anxiety said ""nope."" I just needed to scream this into the void. Has anyone else ever been this down bad for someone they don't even know? Any tips on how to not seem like a total weirdo when your only connection is ""I live above you and I'm your biggest silent fan""? TL;DR: I'm hyperfixated on my punk rock neighbor. We've never talked. I'm his silent upstairs fan.

I’ve been struggling for a while, and I'm finally starting therapy soon to begin unpacking all of this and work on myself. So, I’m not just venting. I really want to grow and understand where these feelings are coming from. But it’s been weighing so heavily on me that I felt like I needed to share and get some outside perspective.  I’m a 33f married to a 36M. We’ve been together for 7 years and recently got married. And the truth is… I’m starting to feel like I’m pulling away. I’m afraid we may not be as compatible as I once thought.  In the past, I really believed our differences made us stronger. He’s grounded, stable, successful in his career…a ""real adult,"" in a lot of ways. I’ve always admired that. He brings out the practical, responsible side of me, and I used to feel like we balanced each other.  I, on the other hand, am more free-spirited. I go with the flow, I’m social, I love planning things, being with friends, and just enjoying life. He’s more introverted, guarded, doesn’t drink, doesn’t really get excited easily, and is more focused on building wealth and grinding which, sure, is important but I’ve always leaned toward experiences and connection over hustle culture.  Lately though, it feels like a part of me is being dimmed. I see other couples who somehow manage to be both grounded and fun, both responsible and playful and I don’t feel like I get to be fully me in this relationship. I love him. He’s nurturing, loyal, and I never worry about his commitment. But something feels off. Like the spark is gone. And now, as we think about building a family and a future together, I’m scared. Scared that these doubts won’t go away and worse, that I’ll lose myself completely.  I know I chose to marry him. I knew who he was. I can’t fault him for being true to himself and maybe, deep down, I was hoping that getting married would somehow change things. That he’d become more spontaneous, more emotionally available, more of the partner I wanted. But now I’m realizing… maybe this is who he is. And maybe this is all the relationship will ever be.  I don’t want to hurt him. He’s an incredible person. But I also don’t want to ignore my own feelings, hoping they’ll disappear. I want to be a wife but I also want to feel like I can be my full, authentic self without constantly being pulled in a direction that doesn’t fit me.  His family is very similar to him, and when I picture my future, I sometimes get overwhelmed by the idea that this is just going to be my life always trying to adapt to a mold that doesn’t feel like mine.  There have also been specific events and situations where I’ve felt I couldn’t be my true self and I’ve started to outwardly resent him for that. That’s hard to admit, but it’s real. And if I don’t start talking about this if I keep pretending it’s fine I know I’ll end up miserable.  Anyway… if you’ve been in a similar situation, or have any insight, I’d really appreciate hearing it. I’m not here to bash him. I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on inside me, and whether it’s something I can work through or if it’s pointing to something deeper I need to face.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnws6x/i_feel_myself_pulling_away_from_my_marriage_and_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nnws6x/i_feel_myself_pulling_away_from_my_marriage_and_i/

The talk therapist I’m talking to is nice, but of not much help and I’ve tried so so hard to get help from the District Psychiatric Center here in Norway but they keep declining despite me telling my doctor twice now that I’ve had suicidal thoughts and planning.  It feels as if nobody actually cares and that’s true because most people don’t. They have only got time for themselves and I don’t blame them for that in the slightest, but what I wish for is to get help when I ask for it especially in a country like this. It feels like the system doesn’t care enough about people like me who keep telling them about their worsening depression.  Maybe there’s a shortage of staff though and in that case I don’t know which is worse, but both are terrible nonetheless.  It was kind of bittersweet for me to know how easy it was to get Zoloft from my doctor, because the medication seemed to be helping in the start but now it’s made me more depressed and suicidal which is expected. And I’m still going to take them, but it’s also a bit sad knowing that this is probably how a lot of people here in Norway treat their depression and anxiety instead of getting both that and therapy or just getting therapy in the first place.  It has been especially bad now though, since Im still in the same cycle of skipping school because I feel fatigued or anxious and I just don’t know how to stop it. I feel like having a good therapist would help a bit, but again the one I have is a talk therapist and she said she’s not able to help me because it’s out of her grasp and not because she doesn’t want to.  And since I don’t have any friends in school literally zero both due to me not relating to them due to autism, but also due to anxiety. It files the depression and makes me more suicidal than ever before.  I have this terrible complex where I want someone a friend to just be extremely non judgemental towards me and everyone else, and for them to just be neurodivergent in some way, but it feels impossible to find such a person. And I found out that I just want essentially a copy of me that loves and accepts me fully. I realise that such a person is impossible to find and I guess I have to come with peace with that. It just hurts a lot to not have someone that truly understands and I mean truly understands and is there.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnx39v/it_hasnt_got_better_and_my_depression_seems_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nnx39v/it_hasnt_got_better_and_my_depression_seems_to_be/

They've grown up an only child, feeling like nobody would love them and then when you finally do love them, its hard for them to believe it that they end up doing some self sabotaging behaviours and pushing you away. You have to go to therapy for this, and the kicker is that they live in the country under you.  It feels like a roller coaster, it feels like you get hugged one day and stabbed in the back the other day. It's such a gutwrenching feeling.  When I try to think and convince myself that he doesn't love me so it's easier to move forward, even though I don't want to, I just cry and grieve all over again. I think of all the memories and trips we spent together. I never forget the way we felt in each others arms, the softness, the laughs we shared, etc  He is aware that he is the issue, has not blamed me, but the cycle still continues. I am starting to become more angry and hostile which I feel so bad for, I am just so tired and upset of it. He still gets defensive with things. He tries to change, he's not shutting down as much, but just last night he started the whole thing again about reflecting if we should continue this relationship, but then he tells me he wants to stay and be with me.  One part of me wonders if I should stop bringing things up and for him to watch me slowly distance myself to see what happens, but I don't want to purposely have to play this game, I want to share laughs, closeness, intimacy, even when its through the phone. I also wonder if somehow this is my fault.   I feel like it's easier said than done when people say just move on or just leave them, you still have that hope in your heart.

1nny9r3,1758574370,2025-09-22T20:52:50Z,offmychest,My (27f) ex (26m) keeps saying he wants to stay together but things don’t feel right anymore,"So I (27f) have been off and on with a guy (26m) for almost two years now. We have a long history of bullshit that’s happened in this short period of time and a long history of being platonic friends, best friends. (13 years now)  I don’t wanna bore y’all with the details but me and him have had some serious issues involving other romantic interests during this time and I think that’s feeding into our dynamic now. He hurt me a while ago by breaking up with me for mental health and then starting an over year long relationship with someone else who he says severely abused him and constantly threatened suicide if he left her. He stayed until she decided to leave and called me about it, excited that maybe we can finally be together. I was starting a new job that would require me to be away from home at at least a month to months at a time but that’s not nothing to me. We’d just have to rebuild our connection in general yk.   The issue is that after waiting and waiting and not wanting anyone but him, my heart was tired of believing him. I still loved him but I wasn’t in love with him anymore. He’d only text a couple times a week and the conversation was basic. He’d always vent and never ask about me but I still had hope maybe things could change for the better. There at the job I met a guy. I can’t lie I was on some harlot behavior fucking this guy but it was just sex at first. But he slowly started to show up in all the ways my ex hadn’t been. I started to feel like I was catching serious feelings and cheating so I opened up to my ex about it and he went off on me. I won’t type everything he’s said because that doesn’t matter now but he was basically going to cut me off but he took some time to understand where I was coming from as far as wanting a genuine deep consistent connection. He made me promise to cut him off and I told him I would but I didn’t. I don’t have any friends outside of those two and that’s my fault. I could stop fucking the guy but to cut him off when he was the only person I felt like was being there for me felt impossible. Ik that’s my responsibly tho, ik I need therapy and to learn how to foster deep genuine friendships. But I digress.   Eventually, me and my ex finally meet again and he’s distant at first but opens up eventually. He says how he doesn’t see himself marrying anyone else and wants kids with me but I felt bad for still compromising his heart (ik I fucked up and it’s no excuse). We talked again that night and I was honest and told him I hadn’t done what I promised him I’d do. He cried to me and challenged me and I felt like shit and rightfully so. Eventually we made love and he made me promise again and I’ve been keeping my word ever since but the trust is fucking shot.   Since then he’s been a lot colder to me and didn’t respond much. For September I went to see him and it was the same just in person. For a lot of the time I questioned why he even let me come over. His birthday had just passed so I brought him some of his favorite flowers and I made him a handmade card with a playlist and I got him a devotional. (He said he’s been fasting that’s why he wasn’t responding). While I was there his friend came over and we talked. He accidentally reveals that my ex went to Atlanta for the weekend and my alarm bells went to ringing. He didn’t have any money after losing his job but he was able to spend three days in Atlanta ???? I said nothing but I noted it.   His friend complemented the flowers I got for him. My ex asked isn’t my birthday coming up on the 9th. I laughed and said no it’s tomorrow. Then my ex went to grab one of the colognes he had and gave it to me as my birthday gift. I didn’t wanna accept it at first but I did eventually.   Later, we were going to watch some YouTube on the tv and I noticed his ex still had a profile on the app. He said nothing even tho he knew we both saw it, just clicked his user and asked what I wanted to see. I decided to grab him some groceries and household supplies because he was running out with barely any food. I made dinner for us but before that I decided to shower and kept finding girls hair in his bathroom. A blow dry brush with weave stuck in it and I asked him about it. He said he has girl friends that visit but they’re just friends. I say okay with my dumb ass lol. He’s been super withdrawn and he seems depressed but he won’t open up to let me know what’s happening. The last night I was there we kept stepping outside to take “family” calls at midnight. He used to just take those in front of me. He sat in the car until 4am while I cried on the couch and his car’s comforted me. He eventually came back and slept with me.   The next day I woke up left and even tho he was so distant this whole time, when I turned to leave he had tears in his eyes. I hugged him and told him I love him regardless and I’ll always be here for him. I kept asking if he would be okay and he said yes. Idk. I’m more worried about his general wellbeing but idk if me being around him is helping that or hurting. Ik he has trouble being upfront about his feelings but I try to make it easy for him. I never yell or demean his feelings. Idk.   Since then, he’s been a hell of a lot more responsive but it still feels distant. What y’all think?   TLDR: Me and my ex have been off and on and it’s rocky but we agreed to try to make it work. He broke my heart and then I broke his. We talked things through but things haven’t been the same since I hurt him. He still has remnants of his ex and possibly is seeing someone else but had been denying other girls. He won’t open up and is very secretive about his life now. I want to make this work but I can’t so this alone. He also is in a dark space. Either way I wanna support him whether is from a distance or as his gf.   (It’s a lot so feel free to question me on anything. I just really want others opinions because I don’t have anyone to talk about this to)",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nny9r3/my_27f_ex_26m_keeps_saying_he_wants_to_stay/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nny9r3/my_27f_ex_26m_keeps_saying_he_wants_to_stay/

His response to it traumatized me even more. He has spent the last 9 months dismissing, invalidating and gaslighting me about it. We did couples therapy but she fired us as clients after he lost his temper and went on one of his angry defensive tirades. We’ve both been in therapy and we’ve been having a lot of discussions about our attachment and issues we are dealing with. It seemed like he was taking those things to heart and that he was serious about repairing things. I’ve put down increasingly restrictive boundaries for myself over the last few months and I’ve been pretty close to breaking up over all of this. What was left after the boundaries is a skeleton of a relationship but he seemed fine with it, as in, it wasn’t alarming to him how little we had left.   Last night he completely denied he betrayed or abandoned me after what happened in January. He thinks how he’s treated me is ethical and he doesn’t feel any remorse for what he put me through. I was blown away and devastated. He absolutely broke me after what happened in January. I needed support and he turned his back on me. It was one of the lowest points of my life. I spent three months on work leave not because of the initial trauma but because his treatment of me afterwards gutted me completely. He broke me again last night with what he said and I must have sobbed for an hour. He just sat there. He asked me if he could hold me and asked me if I wanted him to leave but I was so upset I couldn’t respond so he did nothing. The only thing he asked me is if I still wanted him, or if I was done with him but didn’t say anything supportive at all.  Later he said he had a clear conscience about what he did to me since January and purely on reflex I told him to get out. He kept talking so I said it again and he started to tell me the only part he regretted. I said if his conscience was clear about what he’s done then there’s nothing left to talk about. He said ok and then asked me if I was breaking up with him. I told him to leave and close the door behind him.   I don’t talk to my mom and a lot of our friends are shared (we both knew them before we dated) so I don’t have anyone to tell me supportive things right now.

I don’t get nearly as much time with my daughter as I’d like to what time I do have I make it worth it, but it still doesn’t feel like enough. She goes back to her mom‘s I have to go back to work and I get extremely depressed that I’m not gonna see her for amount of days. It’s extremely upsetting knowing that I’m gonna wake up and she won’t be there or I’ll come home from work and she won’t be there. It gets really hard to deal with. I tried therapy not got expensive and still hasn’t really helped very much. I just need someone to talk to. my depression‘s been an issue my whole life but now that I have a kid that I don’t get to see as much as I’d like to. It seems like it’s a whole lot worse than it used to be thinking about how I’m not gonna see her. I get sad looking at a horror stuff around my house. Makes me sad going through my phone and looking at old pictures or pictures that we just taken make me sad and then I’ll have to go to work and deal with that depression for the next few days until I kinda get over that and then I’ll have about like half a week to a week of like kind of numbness before I then get to see her again, and it’s like the life is sparked back into me left for five days with her, which is really awesome and we do all kinds of stuff so that the time that we do have is well spent and then she goes back to her mom’s and that depression cycle just starts back over.

I’ve never smoked before and frankly I don’t want to due to health reasons and the fact cigarettes are kind of expensive here I think, and if it becomes An addiction it’ll be a financial strain for sure lol.   Life’s been so horrid and stressful. I’ve been having so many mental breakdowns and it affects my ability to do work. I’ve never smoked but I do recall the vague feeling of inhaling second hand smoke and while it was a bit “made me cough/suffocating” kind of feeling, i recall and now can imagine how or can somewhat numb what I’m feeling? If that makes sense.   Maybe it won’t make my thought process clearer but god I’m so tired of crying every day.   I try to cope with this newfound urge by just imagining the feeling of smoking (ie the brief alleviation of stress, temporary relief) but it can only do so much and obviously it’s just encouraging me to smoke for real  I really don’t want to pick it up. I wish I had the ability to be able to have healthier coping mechanisms. But the truth is, I’m so deep in self resentment and have been having thoughts or just generally imagining how life would be better without me in it since the world continues to spin and all… so it’s just hard to cope in a healthy and consistent way when really all I want to do is numb myself or bang my ahead on the wall lol  I probably won’t pick it up because of the cost and the fact my family can probably easily pick up the smoke scent  on my clothes/body etc if I’m not careful enough and that’s just a can of worms that I don’t have the energy to deal with. But the urge is so strong. To numb myself. The urge to act on self resentment is also so strong. If not smoking, I’ll probably just end up doing other self sabotaging things.. and I hate it.

Today I told my therapist I wanted to die and she then debated me on the methods? She said “why haven’t you done it?” I told her all methods suck. She asked “which ones?” And I said “For example a gun leaves a mess of your brains.” And she then asked “Why does that matter? You would be dead.” I told her I didn’t like making a mess. She then said “Again why does that matter? You won’t see it. Who would find the mess?” And I know she wanted me to say I care about my parents or whatever, but I didn’t want to give that to her. So I stopped talking.   And I might not be too much help because then she tried to get me to talk about what matters to me and I told her nothing. And she kept debating me on what was nothing. And the problem is that I wanted to say that “nothing enough to do something about it” but I didn’t say that. She also said nothing is a totalitarian phrasing that I don’t actually care about nothing.  We talked about knives for a while too. She also argued with me about why I wouldn’t use them.  Then she tried to get me to tell her what I feel when I say “I want to die.” And I was just thinking “Lady, I don’t fucking care about my feelings! I want to die.” And then she asked what I’m avoiding by wanting to die and I’m like “everything” and she goes “what’s everything?”  At some point we pivoted on why I keep going to therapy if I don’t care. I’ve been asking myself that very same question. I told her it was routine. She said something about how doing something for no reason is irrational and that I must have a more substantial reason, that doing something out of habit has a reason.   She also brought up the fact that I’ve been in therapy since I was seven and she then ask how much my lack of progress has been because I refuse to share things in therapy.

I believe she’s battling some pretty severe depression and I can’t figure out how to help. She’s 71, retired, and currently has an ankle fracture.   Some background info: my grandma (her mom) passed about 3 years ago and I think that took a Pretty big toll on her. She’s retired and basically hasn’t done anything in retirement other than care for my grandma. I think she’s lost now that she doesn’t have anything meaningful to do. She has the opportunity to partake in meaningful interactions, but doesn’t (for example could have gotten a part time job at the library and she’s been invited to ladies bunco club). What she really does most days is watch tv and plays on the computer. She sees her friends every so often on the weekends. She’s married to my dad who is amazing and they have a dog.  Since she’s gotten this ankle fracture, her mental health has taken a turn for the worse, she’s having panic attacks, not eating, hasn’t showered In over 3 weeks, doesn’t get out of bed or her robe, etc etc. we’ve even called paramedics bc we don’t know what to do with her. But she refuses hospital help bc the wait times are too long. my dad is an angel and takes amazing care of her. I also go over there every other day to check in, do whatever errands they want, try to socialize/engage with her, etc. but it’s getting awfully depressing for me to go over there. I told her best friend about these issues and today the 2 of us brought her dinner and upon leaving, her friend agreed it’s depression and was also depressing to even be there.  My mom is a typical 70 year old who doesn’t believe in mental health. In life when I’ve brought up my own issues (feeling anxious, worried, sad, etc) her response is “well just don’t feel like that it’s that easy.” So I don’t vent to her much anymore. She would be extremely offended and have a break down if someone recommended therapy to her. I also don’t think she’d go or try. I believe she’s embarrassed about her ill health at 70 (over weight, hard time doing stairs etc) and compares herself to other women her age on Facebook who are traveling and spending time with grandchildren etc (she has 2 grandchildren but they live 2 hours away, I recently suffered a miscarriage but may have kids one day which is another reason I’d like her to make improvements mentally and physically).

This happened after just thinking I was ready to go back into dating from breaking up 1 year after, with my ex-fiancé. For context, I would have been married this past weekend. Honestly though, I’m still happy with my choice with breaking up with him and his family. If anything, I would have been in a depression when I had to live with him and his family. Anyway…  I have lost all interest in doing what I love to do. I have lost interest in reading, painting, other art forms, working out, playing videos games, and even watching movies/tv. There are times I must say where I gain interest, and come up with ideas on what to draw or paint, buy supplies, make a plan on what to create, and then the next I’m back to this empty dark black hole of weird comfort of loneliness.  I want to date, I want to find my person, but I know I’m in no shape what so ever mentally to do so. I will find the wrong guy by looking in the wrong places, probably like I did with when I was with the guy who SA’d me. I want a family, but at the same time, I don’t even live on my own yet. I’m 34, and still living at home. I have a great job, but I’m paying off my credit card debt. I’m feeling so behind, and I’m now overly more sad and jealous than happy when I see my friends who post their kids and babies, or husbands. I feel like I failed myself. I feel like I had let myself go. I felt like this was even when I was with my then fiancé.  Before being with my ex, I was so focused on work, my friends, and my workouts. When we were together, looking back, I was slowly losing myself. I started fully worrying about his mother and what she wanted, what she thought about us and what I did or said. I was making sure my ex was happy, and did whatever HE wanted to do, and didn’t have interest in my interests. I was making sure he was pleased, but I couldn’t even do that at some point since he cheated on me with a stripper. He was also spending tons of money on porn, and OF. He denied sex from me, and told me that I wanted it way too much, yet we only saw each other (mostly) 1x a week. That hurt.  I sit here, tears in my eyes, wondering if I’ll ever be ok, if I’ll ever find my person. I sit here and think I’ve failed so much for myself and my family. I know my dad wants to be a grandfather. He was hanging around with a younger woman than me, who has a son. He would do stuff for her and her son, but yet when I have asked him to help me, he doesn’t.   I have never felt this way before, and it scares me. My therapist has thought of maybe me going on pills, and that to me is too fucking real. I never been on pills for depression, but I never been to therapy until now. It may be the solution, but the side effects I’ve heard from these pills on TV scare the shit out of me.  I want to scream, I want to run, I want to go away, maybe drive to an unknown place in a different state that I haven’t been to, and start over. I know it’s easier said than done. I just can’t help but think I have nothing else going for me here. I have nothing to live for where I will find my person, live on my own, or with said person, and live happily ever after.

1no5q9p,1758594473,2025-09-23T02:27:53Z,offmychest,I just want to be done with life,"I’m 26M and I live in the US for context. I genuinely just feel like I wouldn’t be missed that much if I was gone. I do have loving parents who have supported me but I just feel like such a burden to them. I’m currently living in a house bought by them up north because they want to move back up here eventually since they currently live down south. I can’t afford to move out though because rent is expensive as is trying to get a house in the area. My job doesn’t pay me enough either for that matter and I’m miserable at it. I think a lot of my misery comes from not only my job but my career in general. I’ve hated almost every job I’ve had since I graduated college and I have lost any passion for my career in general. I have no interest in moving up the ladder and they don’t promote internally anyway. I feel trapped at this job right now because it’s the only one that I’ve had that pays at least something slightly livable. I’m a lab technician at a chemical plant if you were curious. I also have a low paying job at the movie theater I’ve been at since High School and I like it a lot better because I actually feel appreciated for my work not just my management but by customers too whereas at my full time job I feel totally useless and forgotten about half the time by management who see me as nothing more than below my coworker even though I do most of the physical testing in the lab. It’s not just work though that’s got me so down though because it’s everything else too. I basically have almost no friends and only have 1 best friend and 1 other friend I regularly talk to. I feel like my best friend and I aren’t as close as we once were though because of our differing religious views making us slowly drift apart since he’s a hardcore Christian and I lean more towards deism. The other friend doesn’t really join us too often. On top of everything too, I’ve never been on one single date before. I’m so lonely and want to find the right woman who would love me but I just can’t seem to attract women. I go to dating events but I just can’t form a connection with anyone and I’m on several dating apps but never get a single match despite me reaching out to so many women. It just makes me feel more like the black sheep of my family since everyone else is in a happy relationship or married happily and then there’s just me: the loser autistic guy who will never be loved like that. Besides, anytime I do develop feelings for someone, they’re usually already taken. It’s happened so many times back in High School and into adulthood. Even just recently I was crushing hard on the new girl at my main job and she’s already taken too. Just like the bullies back in school predicted would happen so maybe they were right about me. Who would even want me anyway? I’m not a typical guy. I’m not into sports or anything macho and I’m not good with life skills like building and fixing things so what kind of man am I? I’m also just out of shape and a bit overweight so that probably doesn’t help matters in addition to being so socially awkward that I have a hard time even trying to approach a woman. I did attempt suicide once back in high school and I thought I’d never want to again but things have been worse than ever lately. On top of everything, I was just in a car accident that wasn’t even my fault which totaled my car and now I have to get a new one which means car payments which throws another wrench in plans wanting to move out of my parents house. I know everyone should just say I should just be grateful because I’ve had my parents support me to get me through college and got me a car before and that I’ve had it easy. Maybe I should be. I just hate myself so much and I want to hurt myself so much because I feel like a complete and utter failure. The world would practically be the same whether I was here or not. Before you ask too, I have been in therapy many times but it has done nothing for me and I’ve probably had at least 8 different therapists over the course of my life. Did in person and online therapy. Nothing helps. I talk to my parents too but I just don’t think they understand how much I’m hurting and don’t understand how I could feel this way. I’ve just been scraping by calling 988 when I need to to talk me down but I just can’t go on like this anymore. Thank you for reading this far if you’ve bothered to read. I understand if you didn’t because it’s a long post. I just wanted to scream into the void here. Who knows?

I have previously broken up with her almost half a year ago but came back since I found out that we're having a baby but after a couple of months. For more context, I've broken up with her because I want to deal alone with my previous mental health problem (CPTSD) and depression that resurfaced after a year of stopping meds and therapy. I don't know that she is pregnant when I broke up with her since she is hiding it from me. I have done everything and tried to ignore my mental health issues since I have now more reason to man up because of our incoming son. However, she had to have a forced abortion on 7 months of pregnancy since she is bleeding and the baby does not have any heartbeat anymore and it is making her ill. After she woke up from the operation, she refused every treatment she need. She refused blood transfusion and even signed DNR behind my back. She did somehow recover and signed ""Home Against Medical Advice"" since she keep telling that she's okay even though she is not.  After the miscarriage, I know she's been going through postpartum depression and the fact that she lost our son. I also found out that her family no longer want to keep her since the pregnancy was not planned and they only found out because her baby bump is already showing. I've been doing my best to be there for her. I don't know but I didn't cry when we lost our baby and the only thing that comes to my mind is that I am too numb for everything since it wasn't  the first time that happened to me because I lost my younger sister 3 years earlier.   I understand why she is angry towards me that I don't even cry by losing our baby. On why she blames me for not being there for her, it was a 2hr flight which I can't afford since I only earn barely enough to support my grandmother and myself. It was like this most of the time which piled up until the mental health that I built up to be strong for her has crumbled adding to my existing mental health problems. I can't be there for her being this broken and still absorbing everything. I already encouraged her to fix her family, talk to her friends to lessen the toll on me but she said that I am the only one she only have. Lately, her mental health is reaching it's limit and she's been hurting herself by cutting her wrists and leg. She's also been admitted recently since the refusal of blood transfusion from her miscarriage has taken its toll. She have a severe anemia and still refusing blood transfusion. She is also threatening me that if I leave her she will take her life.   I don't know how to handle this situation.

I want to get myself something to celebrate it, because I never thought I would be alive for this long and here I am.  Here’s the issue: I like the idea of doing a necklace or jewelry or maybe small tattoo thing (i’m a woman in my 20s for vibes) but I really don’t relate to or aesthetically like the semi colon ideology/symbol (nothing against those who do tho!!) but that seems to be all that’s out there for suicide survivors. I’m trying to find something to remind me of where I am and am looking for ideas or advice on it. For me, remembering that I almost didn’t survive reminds me that I’m lucky to have this life and I should spend time doing things that are meaningful to me etc.   My only idea so far is getting a necklace inscribed that says “i’m fucking alive” on the inside. but then I would have to send that to an engraver and they might be shocked and also if it flips around I could get in trouble at work. Or maybe something that has a lotus on it since they grow in muddy water but I’m not that attached to that. or literally anything else.

I've never done anything big that my parents didnt want me to do besides wearing a cropped shirt or two. Thats literally it. Ive also generally always been a very positive and happy person. Ive been on sertraline for a few years to help with depression, which I basically conquered in February (woohoo!)    However, since summer I have been having increasingly worse anxiety. I never really used to have anxiety before, but it came on, and it came on fast. Ive been extremely anxious about the state of the world (politics and the environment.) So much so that at this point, im ALWAYS thinking about it. It never leaves my mind. Its exhausting because im constantly afraid, im always worrying and scared about the future. Not just my future, but everyone's. And I feel like so many kids in my grade dont even really care that much or pay much attention. But I do. And I feel like I care TOO much. I have been crying a ton lately and just feeling hopeless and afraid.   And my sertraline just stopped working randomly. And so we increased the dosage, but that made everything even worse for me. I dont even know why! It makes no sense.   So, the current situation is that im feeling debilitating panic and anxiety 24/7. Can't sleep, losing appetite, cant focus at school (which is very rare for me, I love school) and nothing will help since my meds stopped working. And I cant get in to see my psychiatrist until sometime in October, but I've been trying to get in since July. So I've been feeling completely AWFUL for months. And I really cant handle it anymore.   I just dont want to live like this anymore. I want to feel normal again. I hate feeling so terrible when im supposed to be having fun. And the worst part is that I've started to do things I would have NEVER even thought of doing before. Like drinking. Literally NOTHING IS HELPING ME. not my meds, not any kind of support system since my mom went back to work, not meditating, nothing. Ive tried it all. The only thing that helps me not be so anxious is alcohol. And i HATE it. I really dont want to drink. I reslly dont want to betray my parents like that. But I dont know what else to do. Thats the only possible way I can have a break from the anxiety. Ive only drank half a beer each time I drank, but I still feel so guilty.  I also feel kinda guilty and invalid because I know there are other people who are struggling way more than me. But im just so tired of feeling like im just a set of eyes in my body l, lacking a soul.   Please help me, please.

A lot has happened in the past year—old fights, judgmental comments, and just… toxic energy I can’t handle. I tried talking to my sister about it, but she brushed it off and said, “It’s family, we should all get along.” And I get that. I really do. But for me, “getting along” doesn’t mean swallowing every slight or pretending I’m okay when I’m not.  Since the wedding, everyone’s been texting me like I’m the bad one. My friends don’t get it, and my family acts like I betrayed her. I feel like I have to defend myself for doing something I honestly think was self-preservation.

Report said it was an aneurism. Everyone believes he passed in his sleep the way he had everything set up. But I know he was awake when it happened. He had texted me minutes before it happened. His search history ended minutes after he texted me. He wasn't charging his phone, his phone died that same night based on an incomplete Google backup.   Everyone thinks he died peacefully in his sleep, and I all hope is that he wasn't scared when it happened. And that's my secret to take with me, I don't want anyone to know he was awake when it happened. I've accepted that I probably couldn't have helped him if I was with him, but I wish I could've been there so he wasn't alone so he wouldn't have been scared.. or maybe that would've scared him, to have me see that happen to him  He was only 30  He wasn't just my brother. So much of me and who I am, was him. So much of my life I didn't share with anyone, I shared with him. He was my best friend, he was part of me. It wasn't just my brother that died that day, part of myself and my life died too.  After finding him, after the call to 911, I made arrangements for a friend to hold my gun. Not because I'm a danger to myself and might do something stupid, but because it's what he would've wanted me to do. After seeing how much he hurt everyone, the last thing on my mind would be to that to everyone again but worse. But I can't say the thoughts haven't popped into my mind.    I've never felt more alone now than ever, with all the support everyone tries to give me from my bf, family and friends. None of it is the same because my brother was my main support who knew more of what was going on in my life than even my bf. I wouldn't even have to tell my brother how I was feeling for him to know.   I did what he would've wanted me to do and looked into therapy. Unfortunately based on what and who I've found, I don't think it's going to work for me.

It’s not because I resist sharing, but it’s because I think there’s no point in sharing your story with someone, I mean how can someone help me through words only?   But during my early 20’s, I was on the verge of being suicidal. I lost interest in life. There was something from my past that kept coming back every time I was enjoying or having a good time with someone.   I was making myself realise that I am not worth all of this, I don’t deserve this happiness & these great moments. The trauma was so personal that I was not able to tell anyone about how I felt & what the reason behind it was. At that time, I was not even aware of the reason. But life has something beautiful in it for me. It all began in college, when my girlfriend—who was just my friend back then—met me. She kept pushing me to join them for movies, hang outs & canteen discussions. It was then that I realized what care feels like. She forced me to break that self-sabotage loop even after my resistance. I realised that yes, I can be loved too. We started spending time with each other and eventually started dating. I got some strength and shared with her the trauma. She didn’t go mad at me; she just listened and provided the affection that I needed.   It was like somebody accepted me with my flaws. With time & the strength she provided me, I was able to enroll in therapy. Happitude Studio is a remarkable place which helped me to process my emotions & the irrational beliefs. It was a long process with multiple recurring sessions, but each step helped me gradually lift the burden I had been carrying for decades.   Now, when I look back, I realise I have come a long way. It’s all because of the acceptance & self-help journey, I trusted to walk upon. Therapy is such an amazing and essential process that I believe everyone deserves.

People around me don’t seem to understand how bad it really is, which makes things even harder. I don’t get how others expect me to focus on school or help my mom at home when I can barely take care of myself. Most days I can’t even shower, brush my teeth, or eat properly—it all feels impossible.  So I guess my questions are:  \* Do you have any advice?  \* Or can anyone here relate to what I’m going through?

I’m A citizen of Israel, I was born here and raised here (I felt like outcast most of my life here), as many of you probably know there is a terrible war going on here/Palestine since 7th October 2023 affecting the lives of many innocent civilians on both sides.  There is not a day that I don’t think or cry about the situation sometimes I even have panic attacks because of me feeling so so depressed and guilty about the situation.  As someone who can’t ignore the suffering of both sides I feel extremely guilty and sad about my governments terrible actions in Gaza and seeing some of the Israelis have zero empathy makes me sick to my core for example every time I say that many actions are unacceptable I get judging and mean comments. but at the same time seeing people who support Palestine saying things like the 7th October was justified or that the hostages lives doesn’t matter or that hitler should had finished his job I get so sad.. there is not a day where I don’t cry don’t feel depressed why people are so cruel I ask myself every damn day why people can’t show empathy anymore? Those thoughts make me really depressed and I don’t know what to do I feel like I can’t handle it anymore  (Another question: if someone here is a pro Palestinian do you think I’m a bad person or do you hate me for being an Israeli citizen?  People from Israel can you relate?)

And right now all I want is to vent about my situation and maybe get advice for what to do, or maybe just tell me I'm not crazy or something, idk  Ok, for some back, I'm an 18-year-old freshman in college. I have been diagnosed with autism/adhd, and I also have some pretty bad social anxiety. I never had friends, dated anyone, and as far as the therapy and getting actual help, I'm working on it. I just like venting my feelings out towards the internet.  Now let's talk bout the situation. I've been getting into audiobooks lately. I love reading books, but I have always had a hard time focusing on reading, so of course, I thought audiobooks would be a great option since I just sit down and listen.  Two books have really gotten to me and made me think about my life in general. The books are Fpr Get Not and Get The Girl. I highly recommend you read them.   I keep it short; I won't talk about what the books are about, but this story helps inspire me to try keeping a goal of my own to go to one of my college clubs. I wanted to be doing so, all I wanted was to at least see the room the club was in, and the people who were going  but i never ended up finding the room that the club was hosted in i could have ask staff question about where it was but i was so mentally,phyicals and socially tired that i just ended up going home i felt like a failure like i been talking about making friends and working on my social skills pretty much all my life and when i have the opportunity to i just bail   I felt terrible. All I could think about is how even though there are hundreds of thousands of people living similar lives to me, the fictional character who is pretty much living in the exact situation I am currently in, Molly from Get The Girl, but they're doing better than me, they're actually putting in the work to better themselves   i keep remembering past statement that people said to me like my father telling me how it my fault that i don't have any friends since i some point i shut myself out after a certain he said that nothing ever happen to me to lose that i guess socialspark i use to have as a kid and no one took it away so it my fault that i'm alone apart me know this isn't 100% true that throughout my life i been dealing with a lot from the years social isolation, depress and not even really feeling completely  safe in my own house i know why it so hard for me to make friends   But even so, I'm the one who is supposed to fix it, and no one in my life is helping me through it. It feels like a chore in itself just to get my family to realize how much I struggle, let alone actually doing something to help me   But I don't think I can do this by myself, like I always bail out of it when I'm with someone I somewhat comfort with, but when I'm by myself, it's too much, not to mention apart, notice being independent might be harder  idk, I feel like I can't listen to stuff that makes me happy, like those stories or certain songs or shows, because they always leave me stuck, realizing that I don't have what they have, that deep down I'm still alone   Sorry for the long post, I've shortened it. It's still long if you have any questions or advice comments anyway they are always welcome, and thank you for listening to my vent",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nod10c/i_feel_stuck/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nod10c/i_feel_stuck/

1nodqma,1758623325,2025-09-23T10:28:45Z,depression,I wanted to share some good news,"It's a bit of a spiritual journey...  It all started when I was 8 years old. I called my dad an egg-head and he took it personally. From that day forward I became the blacksheep...  Some traumatic things happened and it was decided I go to therapy even though I wasn't the problem.  My mom's lack of support led me to hunch my shoulders and carry emotional bullet holes along the base of my back. My spine was like Achilles heel and the wound only got deeper.  I went through the motions but felt horribly neglected and cast out.  The pain was unimaginable- no social or emotional connection to anyone, least of all my family and school.  Luckily, my mom's best friend answered when i called her during school lunch playground.  I asked her- what's the meaning of life?  She said- to be happy.  And since then I enjoyed my life, I made friends, ignored the teacher's cruel assumptions of me, ignored my dad's stress induced hate, my mom's cruel apathy, and my younger  sister's machiavelian cruelty.  I just did my own thing. Stepped to the beat of my own drum. I'm fortunate, and I live in NYC, and barnes and nobles was a thing, so after school, until closing (which was 11pm), i would read. Mostly manga, to be honest, but still.  And i was happy.  I made a friend, let's call her A. She was not happy. I tried to lift her up, but she coroded me and pulled me down. She was desperate to have a friend, and i felt bad, even though we had no similar values.  She was always insecure and kept puahing her religion, culture, and political views on me while being fake, jealous, and inauthentic. But i chalked it up to her loneliness. Eventually she eroded my values, self esteem, and life choices.  All throughout my childhood she sought (maybe unintentionally) to put a wedge between me and my family, my ethnicity, and my religion. And it worked. I got into arguments with my parents based on the way she framed my life, and again, my self esteem eroded...  But she was my 'friend' because she was 'nice'? To my face? ANd if the compliment sounded backhanded, that's just because she's awkward, right?  I made more diverse friends. People who didn't think like me and honestly didn't get me. But they were fun and nice and easy-going, at first. They too tried to push political views on me, but in an accusatory way. Why should i be yelled at for my religion? Or my parents country of origin? Why are my friends psychotic?  One psychotic friend said i have 'anxiety' and she knows because she's a pre-med major. And that i should take meds...  It was a disaster. Meds actually give anxiety. It was never explained. I got more and more anzious, and thought holy shit she was right!  I lost my job, to the glee of all my friends. The first friend said i was never suited for the job anyway, and instead of having an entry level job like i had been doing for a year and a half i should be a part time contractor...  ANother friend said good luck getting a job because it takes a long time and there's no way i'll get one.  Another i said instead of getting a job i was thinking of going to grad school and he was also overtly negative.  Thwrapists were also negative. I was 'jumping to conclusions'. 'black or white thinking' 'using should statements'. EVerything i said was constantly dismissed and my soul felt sick.  I quit the meds (the therapist thought he was a doctor and told me to go back on my meds, which i listened then said no, he's not a doctor so don't listen to him....??). I fired him.  And then i went through programs through therapy to help me get a job, so i thought. Life skills group. But it was all bogus. 'broken record technique' just makes me sound mental. 'radical acceptance' of negative thoughts broke me. ANd more. I was worse off than going in.  I went back on meds, and my period was getting worsw from stress. I was now bedbound and cramping 2/4 weeks. 14/28 days. Diarhea, fainting, dizziness, hot/cold flashes, pain, poor concentration, fatigue. For 2 weeks out of 4. Half my life. Is this the new normal?  My parents got me an apartment because 1. They wanted me to be independent 2. I was pissed at them forholding me back and they sisn't want to live with me anymore. I had been trying to move out for years, but the therapist was nuts and psychotic and misleading. None of them helped me with my goal of getting a job (no resume workshop even!) let alone housing! Constamt dismissal...  Anyway my parents got me my own place and my health significantly improved. My first friend said oh no they kicked you out. And framed it in the worst way possible. I wasn't completely in my right mind from pmdd and it got me to the core.  I tried therapy groups again. And meds. And my 'friends' crashed my new place and risked me getting kicked out for real. Again, the groups failed me. The therapist failed me. The meds failed me. My friends...were my friends? Weren't they?  I didn't know what the problem was. I took a chance and left the country for some distance.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nodqma/i_wanted_to_share_some_good_news/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nodqma/i_wanted_to_share_some_good_news/

Either way, most of the time I haven't had much of a problem living with this. It's also not a feeling I have 24/7, only occasionally. Lately though, it's been feeling really bad. It's intense and it's never ending. I feel like I can't do or think certain things because a part of me constantly feels like I'm being watched/judged by the person in my head. Sometimes said person in my head isn't anyone specific, just a vague entity with no features. Other times it's real people, either ones I know personally or sometimes people I don't know personally. At the moment it's a real person I don't know personally, which is always the worst I'd say. It feels like, when I watch movies or listen to music, the people involved in those can somehow access my head. I know it probably sounds silly, but thats what it feels like.  Now logically I know no one is there and that it's not possible for a person to be in my head. Unfortunately logical thinking doesn't make the feeling go away. It's kinda like how, if you're on a plane, a part of you might be scared it'll crash even though you know the chances of it are extremely slim. But you can't make the fear itself go away just because statistically it's unlikely to happen. I can tell myself over and over again that no one is in my head, but the feeling won't go away.  I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to make the feeling go away or at least lessen? I do have a therapist, but I haven't been going to her long so haven't mentioned this feeling before (especially as, again, most of the time it really hasn't been much of a problem for me), but I do think I'll mention this in the next appointment if I have the chance. In the meantime though, I'd really like to at least lessen the feeling because I've been in a constant state of anxiety and distress due to this. Focusing on some specific task helps sometimes, but not always and it usually returns once I'm not distracted.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nodr5o/i_feel_like_someone_or_something_is_in_my_head/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nodr5o/i_feel_like_someone_or_something_is_in_my_head/

Boyfriend works in a creative field as a freelance photographer and freelance graphic designer even though he graduated from Accounting. I was kind of depressed because I can't get the job that I want. However, at some point I create videos on TikTok and it blew up and it makes me kind of a micro celebrity around where I live.  While my boyfriend tried to send application as a photographer for a company (let's just call it company A, it's a creative related company), boyfriend said to me “Hey, they are looking for a host, you should apply because you used to be an English teacher.” I said okay but I don't really think about it, because I don't think that I would like that kind of job. Boyfriend kind of insist me but I just said okay. While he send his application, he helped me send my application because I know nothing about creative field. I never gave it any thought that I would get accepted.  To my surprise, because the company found out that I am a micro celebrity on TikTok, they called me and ask me for an interview the same day. And after the interview, I got accepted and I got a good salary. My boyfriend got an interview about two weeks after he send his application, but after another two weeks, he got rejected. He continues working as freelance for like 8 to 12 hour job a day while sending job applications and I work 9-to-5, and sadly he didn't get paid as much as I do. There's a point that he finally got hired but he had to work 6 days a week, 11 hours a day (from 1pm to 12am) and he had to quit after 3 months.

1noejuq,1758626112,2025-09-23T11:15:12Z,mentalhealth,"Severely struggling in the mornings, looking for advice","Hi, I would really appreciate hearing some input about a situation I have been in for the past months.  Every morning, I (24, female, if it matters) wake up feeling horrible. I'm sure that is something that resonates with many depressed people, but for me, it's *mostly only* in the mornings. I will go to bed telling myself that my life is alright, that I can handle anything life throws at me, and I go to bed mostly feeling content and at peace.  However, I wake up in the mornings and all that made me feel good the evening before is out the window, I'm essentially starting at 0. I sometimes wake up from the anxiety I feel. It's becoming increasingly hard to do anything in the morning. I need to ""manually"" remind myself of all the things that came naturally to me the evening before (""nobody hates me"", ""I'm safe"", ""I can manage the problems that my life throws at me"").  I have come up with 2 reasons as to why this might be:  1) Waking up in the morning feeling lonely. I used to not have this issue when I was in a relationship. I work from home so I don't really see anyone the first few hours of the day. I can pinpoint that the moment in the day that I start feeling better is often when I start talking to people. However, I can't really be sure that this is the reason because the anxieties that I'm facing don't really have to do with being lonely. It just helps being less lonely, if that makes sense. On top of that I also struggle with anxious attachment and the constant fear that everybody hates me, so when I start talking to people in the evening it soothes these fears at least. However, I usually go to bed telling myself ""Nobody hates me, it's fine, I had fun with my friends today"" etc., so why are these thoughts completely reset in the morning?  2) I'm anxious about what the day will bring me and if I'll be able to handle it. I've been dealing with mental health issues and a generally difficult period in my life for almost 2 years now, and some days I feel like I can't handle it. In the evenings, I'm able to look back at the day and tell myself ""I was able to handle today, it's going to be fine"". However, in the mornings I don't really have a clue if the day is going to be difficult or not, so maybe that is the reason why I am stressing about it?  One way or another, I can't really say what causes it or how to self-soothe myself in the mornings. I feel like I'm an entirely different person in the mornings vs the evenings. 90% of my mornings are horrible, while 90% of my evenings are fairly pleasant. I struggle a lot because it makes everything so much harder unnecessarily - Any task or chore is so much easier to do in the evening than in the morning.  I would appreciate any advice or re-direction. I can't find anything about my specific problem online and I feel like I'm going insane.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noejuq/severely_struggling_in_the_mornings_looking_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noejuq/severely_struggling_in_the_mornings_looking_for/

Things haven't been easy for me, I've tried my best to forgive the people who hurt me in the past, specially because they are also family, people tell me ""you only have one family you need to try to solve things among them...."" I really tried my best, but it seems I don't have a family anymore. I tried to make my own family through friends, its harder than i expected. The friends I have are too busy to text me or visit me. I live in this new house for one month and no one has ever visited me although I invite them over all the time, I am talkative and friendly, but no matter what I feel alienated.   My whole family look so happy together, they make parties and trust each other. But somehow I never belonged there. I am the only one who is a diagnosed neurodivergent, I think they are not used to it, I try to understand them the most but I don't understand why they abused me so badly when I was younger.   My old friends have no time for me anymore, I have 3 and they have their own lives, they go out on parties and they game a lot. I really wish they would talk to me sometimes... But a few words a week is enough for them. But I understand them, not everyone would like to talk to others all the time.  I am very positive and I fight against depression everyday not to be on psychosis again... I just got out of a long psychotic state, which is usually how my life is. I dealt with depression for since I was 6 and at 20 now my therapist said last month it has been particularly better, now that I moved out from my family. But I cannot enjoy my life, suddenly my bike (my main transportation since public transport is too expensive to me) broke and my laptop is broken and I only have a half working smartphone. I have no money to do sports nor anything involving other people that is paid. Gratis things are often too far or not available to me (I asked my counselor). I would love to go to concerts, but not even 5 euro I have to pay for an entrance ticket, I spent everything with medication because I was sick this month. Many things are going wrong at the same time.   My real friends (that actually have conversations with me) are my therapists and counselors. I wonder if I'm asking for too much to have friends and family as well.     Perhaps that's just a momentary phase. But a bad phase has been into my life since forever, when I get better many bad things happen and I can never have the taste of being at least having a normal life.   I wish I could work or study but my therapist says I'm not fit to it now that I need to receive intense therapy for all the abuse and neglect I suffered in the past.   I hate no one and I blame no one for the awful things that happened to me. But I would just like someone to tell me things are going to be ok one day. I'm sorry if I didn't write my text properly... I just wanted to vent quickly.   I know moving out is a huge improvement and I just need to get used to it, but it is very hard for me to pass through this. I didn't mention everything that has been bothering me, I just wanted to vent about my social life.    thank you for reading",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nofgxr/i_try_my_best_to_like_my_life_but_it_seems_quite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nofgxr/i_try_my_best_to_like_my_life_but_it_seems_quite/

I also come from a family where both my parents did great for themselves even though they come from modest families. They both work hard and so I have been raised in a ""you have to give everything to your work and make good money even though it means you have to do a lot of overtime"" culture. Growing up, I had the chance to go on a lot of vacations around Europe and I also had the chance to practice an expensive sport (horse riding). All in all I know I was lucky to have all that because my parents did not get to have this when they were younger. I also know that my parents did everything they could to have the life and money they have know (moved away far from their families to go to school, had sometimes 2 or 3 jobs to pay rent when they were younger, ...). Today (and for almost 5 years now), I don't live with my parents anymore and I pay most of my expenses (they help with vet bills sometimes and I always pay them back).  I just entered what will be the last 2 years of my education (master's degree) and in my school you do 1 week at school learning stuff and the next 2 or 3 weeks you work in a company you signed a contract with.   My work is great. I have been there a few weeks and the team is cool, everyone is nice and I am quite well paid. School is boring but it was my dream school, I worked very hard to get in it so I kinda don't mind I guess.

I am really grateful for everything they did for me but I never felt that I am where I need to be.   I have always been anxious and depressed because of a few things that happened when I was a teenager (especially about school). It was to the point that I tried to take my own life when I was a teenager and the only thing that helped me was my horse. (I also got therapy and medications at some point.) It sounds stupid but since I never cared about myself, I started caring about an animal and it stuck with me.  Lately,I started having bad panic attacks again because I know I soon will be ""a grown up"" and I'll have a job that will take most of my time. I already don't have much time for myself (I work a 9-5 one hour away from my house but I do a lot of extra time because it is not well seen to leave before 6.30 where I work). I also try to sleep at least 8 hours per night because I know I don't do well with less sleep. I also live with my BF and he has much more free time than I have so when I get home he is waiting for me to spend time with me. On the week ends, my BF liked to do stuff so we are always seeing someone, our families or just doing a random activity.  Anyway, I just don't know... It seems to me that it is quite a sad way to live to have just a few hours for yourself while being young and healthy... I am not lazy, I don't hate work I just don't find anything that interests me except horses but I don't even have time for my own horse anymore because he is far from my place (1 hour drive each way) for health reasons. I only go there one time during the week and one time during the week end (because my BF wants to spend time with me too so I can't stay there as long as I want to).  I know I am not happy right know because I pretty much spend my days crying and thinking about how miserable of a life it is to not even have time to see your loved ones when you get home  or practice your hobby. I want to make my parents proud because they gave me everything so I can have a good life and a good education but I know I won't be able to stay in this situation much longer.     I know I am lucky for the life I was given but now that it is my turn to be ""a grown-up"" and have a job and everything, I feel like it is just sad to spend your days behind a desk, not seeing the sunlight and going home tired just to do the same thing the next day over and over.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nofs64/growing_up_or_getting_old_idk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nofs64/growing_up_or_getting_old_idk/

(Warning: Self Harm)","(For context, I am 20 and male.)  Recently, I consoled one of the few friends I have over text, since she has been experiencing some personal issues of late. I listened and offered to help however I could, whether running errands, lending an ear whenever she needs it, etc… and when it was done, I couldn’t help but think that for all the times I’d done that for others, both aquaintances and close friends alike, I couldn’t recall anyone doing such a thing in return. I suppose I never asked anyone to, and wouldn’t expect anyone to understand even if I did. So, I figured I might try something I haven’t done before and post some things here. Though I will spare some sensitive details and restrict this rant to only one particular issue, this does reference self-harm. Forgive the lack of coherency or form, as I’m not terribly concerned for the presentation of this rant. Anyways…     For the first time in roughly seven months, I harmed myself during a particularly intense panic attack. I won’t include details since there will likely be people reading this who are sensitive to such information.  I think I have relapsed into this habit again, as I’m now thinking of it and have twice done it since during either prolonged anxiety or intense panic attacks, which have also increased in frequency and intensity. All of this is most likely from transferring to a different anti-depressant/anxiety treatment because the last one (mirtazapine) hardly worked in the first place, and recently caused me to pass out in public, along with other long-term symptoms I had ignored for years until the syncope. I transferred to another medication (fluvoxetine) which isn’t helping in the slightest and if anything has just exasurbated issues like insomnia, etc. So I’m going to have to transfer to ANOTHER medication soon and see if that helps any…  I’m not sure if this is simply a temporary thing with transferring between medication, and if the self-harm urges along with the recent flare up of anxiety will pass as I adjust to the new medication. It truly seems like life just won’t relent, this is all happening among a plethera of other issues, both long term and recent.

Like maybe I should just shut up and deal with it. I know it all begins and ends with me. I know some post on the internet won’t fix anything. But I’m here anyway, because I don’t know what else to do.    When I was younger, I never thought life would turn into this—waking up every day with self-harm thoughts stuck in my head like background noise. I don’t even know where it went wrong. I just know I can’t let go of certain memories, the stupid little things that still hurt like they happened yesterday. I wish I’d been happier, I wish I hadn’t been bullied, I wish my parents had asked me if I was okay instead of pretending not to see me, I wish the world had been a softer place. Yeah, I...w...i...s...h...  And then I feel pathetic for wishing. For even writing this. For needing anything at all.  Ugh, pathetic again. Yeah, I’ll stop rambling about my god-awful days. I just want help. A simple answer: what should I do to stop these self-harm thoughts? I think about hurting myself all the time. Not just “thinking”; I’ve done it many times.  I could go to therapy, but no one cares, actually. I doubt therapy will help. Medicines didn’t. I feel like I’m suffocating in a city full of people and warmth. I’m at a stage where I don’t want warmth anymore because I know I can live without it. I know I’m weak, and I need to shut the fuck up—sorry for the language.  Do any of you ever just want to die without any reason? Have you ever tried? No matter how much I try to change, I end up back at square one, with the same thoughts and the same cycle. I should be studying; I should be building a life, supporting myself. But instead, I’m here, stuck, thinking about self-harm. Is it even possible to get addicted to it? Maybe I am. Maybe I don’t even want to get better.  And yet… some part of me still wants someone to care. To hold me and tell me I’ll be okay. NO, That’s what the younger me wanted. Now I don’t even know what I want. It feels blank. Empty. Like I don’t want anything at all.  This is my first post. Maybe I’ll keep posting until someone bans me.

What surprised me was how much VR therapy actually helped. Instead of just imagining these scary situations, I could practice them in a safe virtual space. At first it felt strange, but the more I tried, the more my brain started to calm down. I practiced giving a short talk in VR before I ever tried it in real life.  I simulated casual conversations and realized I didn’t have to be “perfect” to connect with others.  Slowly, the fear started to lose its grip.  It’s not an instant fix, but the idea of being able to face your fears privately, step by step, gave me more confidence than I expected.  Has anyone else here tried VR therapy for social anxiety? I’d love to hear your experiences.  If you’re curious and want something simple to start with, I found a free 5 day guide that explains the basics and how to build a small daily practice.

I figuring out whether I should accept her.,"I(M29) and my wife (F29)  have been through some weird situation that I thought would not happen to us. We gave birth to our sweet heart (F1) 1 year ago. At that delivery my wife was never the same. It was like some satanic powers had consumed a fairy. The most loving, mature, playful and understanding person became really hostile and it has also started affecting our baby. I knew ppd was a thing for women but this was horror for me day in day out. She got more hostile day by day. It felt like she despised the sight of my face and it was heartbreaking. She mocked the most sensitive things, my mental week spots in worst possible way that I shared with her. I'd cry at night in the bathroom to not disturb her sleep. I decided to give her as much space as I could and took the full responsibility of our girl. I couldn't afford a nanny so I took a break from my job. My boss didn't agree and he thought my situation was bs or even some excuse/lie but I managed to get three months against my proposed 6 months.   I never let my wife worry even about breastfeeding. I arranged the human milk (which was costly). I even avoided to leave baby with her for a few minutes unless she seemed okay or in a good mood. After the break from the job I became the mother and my wife seemed to had chilled out a bit. I sent her to her parents after a couple of months and told her to stay there as much as wants. I used to call her through her mom to ask how she was because I had to make sure she was not in a bad mood. Though she never asked back about how our baby was doing, let alone how I was.  Her mental health was my priority. I took out more than half of my savings to send her to Europe tour she always talked about. She grabbed it like it was childhood dream. That was the first time I saw smile on her face. She went to the tour and found some tourist friends. She used to post some photos and she seemed very happy. Ngl it felt good looking the smile on her face my eyes craved to see. After 2 months she stopped posting photos and would only occasionally call her mom. She extended her tour for 3 more months (might have taken a loan from her relative).  Well I'd be lying if I say didn't suffer in her absence and in my job. The break at my job had pissed my boss and it cost me my promotion and raise that was due for this appraisal cycle. I am not even sure I'd be taken back when I rejoin.  She came back from the tour after 7 months and she couldn't look happier. For the first time in months I saw her smiling towards me. I almost broke down. She hugged me and boy I missed her body fragrance! Now she says she's willing be the best mom to our kid. She talked a lot about her trip and her friends she made on the journey. Then she confessed that she ""may have"" hooked up with a guy there when she was drunk. But she has cut the contacts with him now. I kinda got upset but didn't show it on my face. My friends and family are totally against me taking her back. Even her parents are upset with the decisions she had made. However I believe that the 1 year she was wasn't her real self and she can be a great mom. I am judging her on the basis of how she was before ppd. I only wanted her to be herself again. Yeah , i didn't tell anything about the issues at my job. I understand how terrible ppd can be on women. However I am still struggling to get over her mention of casual fling during the tour. I am getting help maybe I'll figure it out.  Just needed to rant somewhere because i haven't conveyed my these feelings to her as I don't want to stress her. My daughter treats her like stranger but I am kinda helping them to restore the relationship.  Thanks for hanging by.  Update:  I understand people in comments being upset with my approach to this situation and calling me a doormat in the nicest way possible. However everyone's life can have different situations. Everyone's life doesn't go as the same reddit story you had read so I am taking time before taking any decision. I knew that postpartum depression can be brutal for women, and its severity varies from one woman to another. So I am judging my wife on the basis of how she was before the PPD phase. Y'all don't know her and how she was before but I do. She was the best wife I could ask for. The one I could trust with my life. Hence, I am trying to assess this situation more based on reality than on Reddit stories. H*ll she even saved my life once while risking hers. Since she returned, she has been a great mother to our child. It's heartbreaking when your child treats you as a stranger but she's been incredibly patient.   Hence I don't appreciate people belittling her character without knowing her. And about the casual fling she mentioned, this is the reason I am taking help figuring things out whether I should let her be part of my life or not and soon I will.  And I realised I need to have a proper conversation with my wife about everything that happened for the last one year.  I had a clear conversation with my wife last night. I told her to leave everything she's doing and seated her beside me. She understood what this was about. I told her I needed to clear the air and my feelings that has been a turmoil for last year. She instantly broke down. She said she had so much guilt trapped inside her but had no words to take it out. That's the reason she was almost avoiding me since she returned. The guilt has been eating her inside and wanted to take it out. She said after the trip she realised she didn't even deserve my apology. She had my number on her dial every night but couldn't gather to press the call button. I hadn't tell her anything what had happened at my job. She was in an impression I just got an easy sabbatical and things would be fine again. She asked me to blurt out everything thing I had in my heart. Abuses, names she'll listen to everything. That I could even hit her because even that'd be less than what she deserves. I put my heart wide open in front of her. Everything I went through, how I felt and the emotional turmoil I went through. She kept listening and cried harder and harder listening to everything. I stopped talking but she kept crying for next 15 mins. I let her cry it out. After she calmed down a bit she asked in complaining tone that why didn't I tell her anything about the problems at my jobs. That why did I keep everything to myself that why didn't I try to bring her to reality. That why didn't I punish her what she was doing. And resumed cried. I was teary eyed too. This went on for maybe 1.5 hours. She said that I have every right to kick her out of my life but I was the most sensible loving and caring husband in the world a woman can ask for. She'll not force herself on me and give me all the space I need. She said she'd be the best wife and best mother anyone could ask for. She thanked me profusely for stepping up for our child when she wasn't able to. She didn't think that I'd go such any extent for her and our baby. She said I can kick her out of my life but her love and respect for me has increased by a great extent that day.  Then I brought the topic of her casual fling she mentioned. She broke down again. She said it was the first day for her trip when they went to turkey. She was drunk while she was talking to a guy but then she woke up in her hotel room. She said she was really sorry and She swore on her mother that they was only hook up she (might have) had and there was no other guy. I don't know whether to believe her or not.  She cried to sleep in my arms and I put her to bed. Baby was fortunately long asleep before the conversation. I am gonna bring this conversation up my to therapist and figure out what's next.",17,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noik5t/my_wife_was_suffering_from_ppd_and_i_offered_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noik5t/my_wife_was_suffering_from_ppd_and_i_offered_her/

I tried to create some distance and just accept that we should stay friends while I focus on my studies. The problem is, she's genuinely nice to me and stays close, and I can't really avoid her since we're in the same class.  Here's where I'm stuck: logically, I know I shouldn't pursue this and should just be her friend. But emotionally? Every time I see her, those feelings come rushing back.

If I lived alone, I would totally have a minimalist type of home. I forget things ALL the time, I have no energy left at the end of the day to focus on myself. Ashamed to say, but there have been lots of days lately I just lay in the bed at night and feel like I can't even bring myself to shower or brush my teeth. Hear me out when I say this isn't some depressive, not taking care of myself bout. This honestly to me feels like its because my mind goes 9874623487 all day and by 10PM I am flat out dead tired. Some may say I'm in denial and actually depressed. I've been to 2 therapists over the past year, both agree I am very self aware, and not depressed. That being said, I need to find medication that works, or a combo I guess? I have always just taken stimulants, and they do work, a little, but I can also take them and go right to sleep if I wanted. I have always been afraid to try anxiety/anti depressant meds, but I think maybe if I combine the 2, I will get out of this constant cycle I seem to be in. The last MHNP I saw wanted me to try Wellbutrin, but my husband had a seizure on that so I've always been afraid to take it. Anyone relate?

My extended family has always been full of fights, gossip and endless drama over things that don’t even make sense. Just last Sunday it got so bad that neighbors came over to see what was happening. It’s chaos nonstop and it’s exhausting.  Recently, a friend overheard my niece’s grandma and her mom talking about me. They said I’m a bad person, that I only go there just to visit the child, and that I’m the one bringing hate and gossip into the family. Hearing that broke me. Because when her mom calls and finds me there, she always pretends, saying thank you for visiting my daughter. All in fake politeness, while behind my back she’s calling me the problem.  The truth is I don’t gossip. Honestly, when I’m around people don’t even talk freely because they know I don’t entertain gossip. What really triggered the hate was last year when I spoke up about a defilement case in the family. From then on I’ve been treated like the enemy. Even my own dad doubted me when I came forward and that cut me deeply.  No one ever notices the things I actually do out of care. During one of their explosive fights I pulled my 5 year old niece inside and hid her so she wouldn’t have to see the chaos. She’s just a child and she doesn’t deserve to grow up in such a toxic environment.  Yet now I’m the villain. They even deleted my number and blocked it on her phone. And the worst part is I love her but her mom, her grandma and most of them clearly hate me.  I don’t have a job or the finances to move out yet so I’m stuck in the middle of all this. And it’s destroying my mental health. Waking up every day feeling unwanted, blamed and hated while all I’ve ever done is try to protect and love is crushing me.

My legs would randomly stop and start working I was always in pain my arms would malfunction and I would randomly go nonverbal. I don’t have health insurance.

I feel behind everyone else even If I put the effort to study I got no results.  Now I'm really stuck with 2 careers paths. One trying to get into PM with a Master degree (still 0 network), or medical career that means I won't start an adult life until 42/43 years old earning my 1st salary.

My symptoms include or have included the following:  * questioning everyday parts of reality such as having thoughts, having memories, making decisions, performing actions and doing stuff, etc. * feeling that normal aspects of life feel strange or unnatural. * feeling uncomfortable and unsettled when I see people, see my own reflection, or obsess over the fact that I am in a human body. * feeling as if everyone is brainwashed and living in a false reality and I have now become aware of it. * constantly questioning existence itself and the fact that I exist at all. * Unable to focus in meetings or at work because I am actively thinking that what everyone is doing and talking about is not real.  On top of the above, I have been diagnosed with OCD (Pure O) and generalized anxiety disorder. So, I have been susceptible to repetitive thoughts prior to my DPDR experience.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noo91k/can_ssri_dose_increase_from_100_mg_to_150_mg/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noo91k/can_ssri_dose_increase_from_100_mg_to_150_mg/

I was actually prescribed ssri's when i was 16 after years and years of begging my parents for help with my mental health, and they only took me to the doctors because one of my teachers in high school told them that he saw a problem with the way i behaved. When i got screened, my doctor looked at my answers and grimaced (im not joking). When she told my dad that hiding any weapons i could use was a good idea, he punished ME for it and all he did was scream at me and hit me for hours and hours about how i didnt need it, and then he never let me have them. Instead he tried them himself and decided that ""i couldnt handle them"" because it made him get depressive symptoms. Ive not recovered even a little bit in that time, constantly feeling suicidal urges and needing to hurt myself all the time and i just cant take it anymore.  im 19 almost 20 but im losing my fucking mind probably dealing with not just the severe depression but some other undiagnosed things too. I could get meds, but i dont know if theyll take them again because i still live with them, im under their insurance, and i have no job or drivers liscense currently due to the job options. I dont know what to do , should i tell them and risk them blowing it off again? or should i do it on my own and schedule appointments? i dont know what to do, ill miss my cats if i die and i want to see my kitties grow up and play like they always do but i cant take it anymore i need help but i cant get it on my own.

These are just random things Idk if they are related to anything, you can say it’s kind of ranting:  •	⁠Since I was a kid I’m so anxious about everything like literally everything, I started smoking and I’m very dependent on it right now that I smoke 2+ packs per day.  •	⁠Drinking is not normalized in our family (and it’s a blessing for me cause I would’ve been alcoholic as hell if it was) but I do drink once or twice in summer just for the sake of dealing with people and doing whatever I want without feeling so anxious about it (not in an asshole way for sure).  •	⁠I really just think about drinking everyday to deal with whatever I’m going through but after being heavily dependent on nicotine I just try not to fall for the same trap.  •	⁠Idk if this is something but I eat less (could be the nicotine receptors) but I do order food after 2 hours of eating just to eat half of it max and leave the rest (Idk why I mentioned that but it could be something or I’m just retarded)  •	⁠All this shit started to be extreme suddenly, I had a long break with my girlfriend cause we had a lot going on and I wasn’t in a state to go through all of this and I regret it cause It ruined our 5 year relationship and everything seems off right now.  •	⁠All this shit going on through my head while I’m studying and working.

I’ve even made friends—people I think I’ve crossed the “semi stable-unsure-if-they-really-truly-consider-me-a-friend-now"" stage with. And still, it doesn’t feel entirely real. College is starting to feel familiar. I don’t feel completely out of place, but at the same time, I do… it’s confusing.  Weirdly, I keep anchoring myself to this thought: “It’s okay, this isn’t permanent. This isn’t my life—it’s just four years of my life.” Typically, you’d hear that from someone who hates college, but I don’t actually hate it. I’m just… observing it through this lens, almost like a protective thought, even if it’s not consciously shielding me from anything.  Part of my anxiety probably comes from the friendships I’ve made. The friends ive made are amazing, really, and they all seem really close to each other already. But for some reason, I can’t feel as close to them as they are with each other. I think this might be part of why I latch onto the impermanence thing. And what's frustrating is that it's not their fault (the closeness/comfort thing). it's lowk all on me (because they dont treat me weirdly or anything plus we all sorta became friends around the same time)  I notice that when I spend time with my college friends one-on-one, it often feels like that first-time, surface-level awkwardness you get when meeting someone new. It’s not outwardly awkward—someone observing wouldn’t notice—but inside, I feel like I’m not fully comfortable yet. Even if I don’t show it, I’m sure some of that subtle distance leaks out, making the interactions feel a bit mutual and distant.   This isn’t pessimism—it’s something I’ve noticed about myself. Even with my thickest, closest friendships from before college, it took me a long time to feel truly close. That surface-level vibe still shows up sometimes, even with friends I’ve trusted for years. That scares me, because we’re talking about my deepest, longest friendships here. (i catch myself feeling that way very rarely w them though).  I think some of this might be inherited from my dad. He has a kind of aloofness in friendships, and a lot of them feel performative. I’ve noticed that since I was a kid, and maybe I’ve absorbed some of that.  I hate my brain for it. It’s frustrating when your own wiring keeps tricking you, even in friendships you *know* are strong. It makes me anxious, and I wish I could just change it instantly—but it’s not that simple. I don’t always even notice when it happens, so changing my actions feels impossible.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nooud7/i_feel_off_like_im_constantly_in_a_social_limbo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nooud7/i_feel_off_like_im_constantly_in_a_social_limbo/

For some, it starts with anxiety, depression, PTSD, or bipolar disorder—and using alcohol or drugs feels like the only way to cope. For others, substance use comes first, but over time it fuels or triggers mental health symptoms. Either way, both are real, both are exhausting, and they can feed off each other in a way that makes it hard to know where one ends and the other begins.      The truth is, treating one and ignoring the other rarely works. What actually helps is an approach that sees the full picture—addressing both at the same time, with therapy, support, medication when needed, and a lot of patience. It’s not an easy road, but recovery is absolutely possible when both sides are cared for.      If you’re in that place, or love someone who is, please remember—you’re not broken.

Battling cPTSD, ongoing struggle with eating disorder (anorexia/bulimia nervosa) and body dysmorphia since childhood.  Recently a lot of negative self talk, self deprecating thoughts have taken the front seat on my mind.   I kept seeing so many girls online and in the real world... a lot of them so beautiful and with such pretty bodies. All i could think of was ""See that? It could be you but you're not worth it. You don't deserve to look like that. You're disgusting"" and so on.    I had been in multiple abusive relationships in the past, a lot of the abuse was mental and emotional. Growing up i was conditioned to believe that looks are EVERYTHING for a girl, and as an adult i realized it really isn't.  It had been a couple years I'd been in recovery as of late last year. Therapy, gym, etc.   Had a breakup at the beginning of last year so it gave me time to really focus on myself. I lost over 40 pounds (not entirely in a healthy way)  I ended up picking up some pretty bad habits. I had only coffee and water for the most part. One protein shake in the morning before work. At lunch it would be my one meal and one more shake after work. Then gym for 2-3 hours daily.   Naturally, because i was not fully starving myself there was no issue in my mind. And the results were showing.   Fast forward to now, i've been in a new relationship for a bit.  As with any new relationship, we both gained a few pounds (he cooks very well and he has made sure i eat 3 times a day) but we've spent so much more time doing other things together that i stopped working out. Adding to the weight gain.   I have become extremely self conscious... He doesn't really comoliment me in a way related to my body (he will say im cute, adorable and things like that, but never beautiful, sexy, or the such)  I've brought this up to him seeking reassurance but he keeps telling me he sees me beyond my body.   This keeps leading my brain into thinking he too finds me disgusting physically. I've stopped looking at myself in the mirror, I can't stand the reflection.    Went to talk to my primary care provider, discussed a new meal strategy and trying to find the motivation to exercise more. Due to developing a slightly severe case of iron deficiency anemia.   I've taken down all my social media to avoid seeing posts of gym girls and others. But i cant avoid it forever.    The self doubt and negative thoughts persist.

1nopeqh,1758652393,2025-09-23T18:33:13Z,mentalhealth,“From Panic to Peace: How 3 Deep Breaths Saved Me From My Worst Anxiety Spiral”,"Hey everyone, I want to share something that happened to me recently — maybe you’ll find it helpful if you ever hit an anxiety spiral   Last week, I was sitting in traffic, headphones off, stuck behind bumper-to-bumper cars. There was this constant hum of the engine, people honking, exhaust smells, and the heat was awful. My chest started tightening, throat felt dry, mind racing: “What if I’m late… everyone’s judging… this will mess up everything.”  In 5 minutes, I was full panic. Heart pounding, sweat, shaky hands. Usually, I try to scroll on my phone or distract myself — but that night, those didn’t work. I felt trapped.  What I Did Differently  Then I remembered something I read in a mindfulness article: you can’t always change your surroundings, but you can change how your body reacts if you bring awareness to the now.  So I leaned back, rolled down the window a little, and did this: 	1.	Sat up straighter, relaxing shoulders as much as I could. 	2.	Took three deep breaths — in for 4 counts, hold 1, out for 6 counts. 	3.	Noticed what I was hearing: the engine, a car horn, distant music. 	4.	Noticed smell: hot asphalt, the air. 	5.	Noticed how my body felt: chest tight, but also my feet on the pedals, back supported by seat.  ⸻  What Changed 	•	The chest tightness didn’t disappear immediately. But after those breaths, the hyperventilation-like feeling eased. 	•	My thoughts slowed down: “Okay, I’m in traffic. It’s hot. I’ll be okay.” 	•	I felt more grounded — like I had a small anchor in the moment. 	•	For the rest of that drive, I replayed those few breaths whenever I caught myself spiraling again.  ⸻  Why It Works (Science Bit) 	•	Deep breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps calm the “fight or flight” mode. 	•	Slowing the exhale longer than the inhale signals your brain it’s safe, reducing cortisol release. 	•	Focusing on senses (sound, smell, touch) is a mindfulness trick — it pulls you out of the future/past loop anxiety loves to dwell in.  ⸻  What I Learned 	•	You don’t need fancy tools or perfect conditions. A few deep breaths + noticing what’s around you can shift things. 	•	Panic doesn’t have to lead you into a full spiral, especially if caught early. 	•	Small wins matter — this felt like reclaiming control of my mind for those moments.  ⸻  Question for You All: What “micro-habits” do you use when anxiety unexpectedly hits? Deep breathing? Grounding meditations? Something totally weird that works for you? Would love to hear what helps in the moment.

The only times I feel happy and in balance is when I am alone, no one interacts with me and I watch/play something, and looking at others it just feels like they DO get happy from being productive in the long run, which I dont. The only thing I want in the long run is be wealthy enough to be able to close myself into a room and just watch/play something, thats my dream.  What should I look into?

Recently I believe I've been having more and more instances of derealization? depersonalization? Idk, I know the differences but when in that state I can't tell really whats happening. When I was in school, I had one of my first times that I kept feeling like ""I was snapping back to reality"", Id get distressed about it, go on with my life, stuff would fade a little around the edges, and (WITHOUT any real amnesia) I would kind of snap back and realize I wasnt really 100% aware of what I was doing or thinking. This was the week after my councillor called my mom on me, it fucked me up a lot, I don't believe I can ever talk to another councillor again.  I am now in university and my mental health is declining like hell. I'm stressed, I'm overwhelmed, I'm frankly a bit scared for my health because actions i'm taking are declining it, but I digress, I won't get into anything triggering. But most prominently, I have had atleast 2 \*strong\* instances of losing touch with reality. I would sit or stand, and feel my brain kind of drifting away from me. It felt like my thoughts were like, in the bottom back of my skull, this kind of soft place. I'd struggle to really move or say anything or go anywhere or do anything, it was just my thoughts in a husk of a body. My face has started looking different everytime I look in a mirror. I find myself in a constant state of ""I'm aware"" to 20 minutes of auto pilot with slight awareness. Been having a lot of thoughts on the state of living recently, but its been getting harder and harder to process I'm even real, like every day seemingly fades into a dream like state. Things from a day ago feel weeks ago, things a week ago feel like they were yesterday. Days consist of major events and some memories, but never a full recount. I don't think Ive fully processed I'm even at uni, my memories of my entire life before moving feel distant and of a different person, I don't rlly feel like I truly lived through them. I also believe I'm experiencing emotional amnesia occasionally with people I know, as if my best friends are just strangers I'm aware I have some connection to, its isolating not being able to talk to people I trusted because they dont feel like themselves anymore? I don't trust professionals anymore, so I don't have anyone to talk to.  I just feel like I'm going crazy, like half the time I'm dreaming, half the time I'm overwhelmed, like I'm having more and more strong episodes of complete detachment from the world and people around me. Ive read a million posts from others about it, but unless theyre directed at or with me, I struggle to relate. I guess I just needed to get this out somewhere otherwise it stacks up in my brain and in a few days when I'm in a good spot for a day or 2, I'll forget I even felt this way at all until it hits me again.

I’ve built a community around me that I love, I have a group of friends that are everything to me, my partner is here, my job is here and it’s really important to me - but I have just grown to absolutely abhor the state of Tennessee because my values are so dramatically unaligned with those in power here that it just feels so bleak every day. I’m really involved in community organizing, I volunteer regularly, I do my best to support as many progressive businesses and organizations as I can, but it’s so clear that the state and the city just want to extinguish all of it because they’re blindly loyal to a certain someone that I’m having trouble feeling like I can stay here to be a part of that system.   I know the most obvious answer to the problem is just to move. But if I leave, I leave my whole social circle, my community, my job, everything - and I don’t want to do that to start over in a place where I know no one. It sounds silly but I have a lot of social anxiety so the idea of leaving my whole friend group to keep on being friends without me around makes me really sad. Long story short, I have a lot of insecurity about relationships and whether I’m someone people actually want to be around (working on that). I understand that we would stay in contact if I left, obviously, but making new friends has always been hard for me and it would be really difficult for me to remove myself from the pack and from everything I’ve built here.

My (early 40s f) partner (late 30s m) has been having a mental health issue that is very confusing to understand and support.   Over the last months, when he gets to the weekend, he falls into a deep lethargy/depression. He can only see things through a negative lens, complains that he is under too much pressure and can’t cope, and binge eats sugary snacks constantly. During this state he can’t move from the sofa and won’t talk to me or even make eye contact. If I try to intervene somehow he gets angry (I have tried different methods).   On Monday morning he is fine, enjoying work and says he doesn’t understand why he felt that way at the weekend. His business is going very well and he has lots of exciting projects that he enjoys working on and he likes his office environment and gets on well with colleagues.   Then the weekend hits and we’re in the same pattern. When this happens he looks ill and it’s quite alarming. Yesterday he came home from work saying he was fine again, and I stressed to him he really needs to figure it out and find a healthier way to cope with whatever is causing this and he got very angry with me again. Today he called to apologise saying he doesn’t know why he got angry.   He admitted over the last months that he has binge eating issues but won’t get help. Right now I can hear him crunching on a box of cookies. He will eat sweets until he goes to bed.   I don’t know what to do. I am exhausted from dealing with this, especially as it means I am the only one doing chores and cleaning at the weekend. I feel like I have a child instead of a partner.

When I was 22 I left my parents’ home and moved to another country with my then-boyfriend (now husband). The first years were brutal financially, we barely scraped by. We had our son when I was 24 (my husband was 26).  Even after 13 years abroad, I never felt like I truly fit in. I couldn’t make meaningful connections; everything felt robotic, small talk about the weather, no deep friendships. A few months ago we decided to move back to our home country.  The main reason I left in the first place was how toxic my childhood home was. Constant criticism, mean comments, no kindness. My father regularly humiliated me in front of others and called me stupid or not capable. I was ashamed to bring friends over because I didn’t know what he’d say. Nothing was ever praised, only shaming and belittling for any real or imagined mistake. I never felt loved, safe, or protected. I envied friends who had warm relationships with their dads; I was just stupid and not good enough.  My mother acted like she was on my side, but I’d hear her badmouthing me when they thought I was asleep. She plays the victim and picks fights over anything. Their relationship is toxic too, they argue and yell constantly and seem to stay together out of convenience, my mother runs the household and my father provides financially.  Growing up there made me bitter and guarded. But living abroad showed me I’m different, I’m actually gentle, compassionate, and avoid conflict. I raised my son with a lot of love and kindness, things I never received but somehow learned to give.  We bought a property back home that’s being renovated, so for now we’re living with my parents. They aren’t charging us for groceries or bills and I’m grateful. This is our first month back, the renovation should be done in about two more months. At first I thought maybe they’d changed. But the arguing, shouting and toxic behaviour slowly came back, and it’s wrecking my mental health.  I keep asking myself, was it better to live abroad and feel lonely and scared, the fear that if something happened to me and my husband, there’d be no one to care for our child, or is it better to accept that my family is toxic and live with that reality?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noqlwj/returning_to_my_toxic_parents_after_13_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noqlwj/returning_to_my_toxic_parents_after_13_years/

Maybe because I expect the most from them. And it hurts to know that they do not understand the feelings i am going through nor do they put in any effort. I had a bit of anxiety issue (stress overthinking) when my IBS symptoms started after having a gut infection. I was currently dealing with some family issues at the time too. They would get under control. (Unpopular opinion: for my ibs and anxiety i was going to a homeopath as i was/am really scared from going on medication due to side effects and dependency).  My IBS symptoms started to worsen after marriage and so did my anxiety as I had to deal with typical mother in law issues. My husband was always supportive and helped me through it. With time this has gotten only worse, even though we have separated for more than a year now. My husband not understanding and realizing the things I’m going through with constant illness (tummy issues, body aches, lower body muscle and ligament pains). I feel like he doesnt acknowledge it anymore, nor do i get the attention and love I was received before getting married.  I try to keep myself busy with outdoor tuitions, housework but at the end of the day I’m exhausted and want to be feel loved and caress.  • Current condition: My symptoms have now become,  1.	⁠random crying outburst, 2.	⁠screaming, 3.	⁠no asthma problems but have to breathe really heavily, have a little problem with breathing 4.	⁠wanting it all to end, 5.	⁠throwing things (while being alone without the intention of hurting anything), not wanting to wake up. 6.	⁠Body weakness next day and tummy issues 7.	⁠Sometimes having a fast and loud heartbeat (which i can feel obviously as if its loud and fast)  All of this gets worse when my ibs isnt cooperating either because I go into health anxiety, so far doctors say everything is normal. And I dont feel like believing them but thats another story.  My mother and her mother (grammy) had postpartum depression- idk whats it called It usually started after the third baby, and due to overload of stress and depression they would forget everything and everyone around them. Start acting like a child (like legit forget things around them). A bit of childhood trauma from there.  When things got better at my house I got married and had to deal with shit there.   Please guide and advise me and help through this if you guys can. What can i do to make myself better?

1noscpq,1758659084,2025-09-23T20:24:44Z,mentalhealth,The Patterns Of Us,"Hi guys, I’ve struggled with my mental health a lot over the years. I was one of those kids that was shoved into CAMHS and Connexions (UK), and labelled a ‘problem child’. I was passed from counsellor to mental health nurse, to social worker, and ended up moving out of my parents at 17, having a baby at 19, and was suicidal by 21. At 23, after being diagnosed with PTSD, chronic depression and social anxiety, I found a local therapist I connected with and began a five year journey of unpicking the mess that was my mind, understanding the forces, traumas and influences that shaped me, and working to re-pattern the behaviours and thought processes that were keeping me in cycles of self-destruction. This journey led me to develop a new theory, one that re-thinks the mind not as the biological computer we’ve been treating it as, but as a living, dynamic system of self-organising patterns.  Patterns are the language of the universe. From the spirals found in seashells and the Fibonacci sequence seen in the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and florets of a sunflower, to fractals - patterns that repeat forever, found in the branching patterns of trees, lightening, and our very own blood vessels. Symmetry, characterised by balance and regularity, is evident in flowers, snowflakes, and the wings of butterflies. Radial symmetry is found in starfish, while bi-lateral symmetry is found in humans. Wave and spiral patterns are found in oceans, sand dunes and galaxies, and then there are the patterns of us. Of birth, life and death. The in out breathing of your lungs, the double helix of your DNA. We are surrounded by, composed of, and governed by; Patterns.  The language of our mind is no different, and in my book; The Patterns Of Us (currently free in the kindle store), I take you on a journey through the fractal ‘map’ of your mind, allowing you to step back and consciously observe your patterns of thought and behaviour, the forces that have shaped them, and the Voids that have been left through un-met needs. I also offer a method of healing, focussed on compassionately addressing root causes rather than suppressing the most destructive symptoms, and explore topics such as epigenetics, hebbian learning, cognitive biases, the magnetic attraction between patterns, and the mind of a psychopath. I’d really love to get some feedback and maybe even an honest review or two! I wrote this with the idea of helping as many people as I can, so even without the feedback/reviews - I hope it’s able to help someone out there who needs it <3",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noscpq/the_patterns_of_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noscpq/the_patterns_of_us/

We've been dating for almost 2 months. The problem I'm having is in my head. Were great in bed and I really enjoy spending time with her in general. The thing I've notice and she is noticing to is that I seem miserable. Like I mentioned I love spending time with her, but in my head my anexity is flying off the rails thinking (maybe she's the one, maybe she isn't? ""Am I really attracted to her or not?""). I've never been in a relationship this serious before. We met at work and she hit me up on Facebook and we went on a date. Now 2 months advanced my mind races with anxiety. Ive known her for 5 months. When i first saw her i felt like theres something between us...... My mind is finding flaws about her that I don't seem to actually care about but it blows them out of proportion. I constantly look at her body looking for reasurance in my head. I sound like a garbage human but when I calm down I actually enjoy all of her.   We moved pretty fast i would say. After 2 or 3 weeks we went on a mini trip to west virgina, it was a blast. Now we're going to Tennessee in a few days. I was spending 5 days out of the 7 with her. I see her 24/7 constantly because of work and personal life. Is it just that I'm feeling smothered and my brain is finding any reason to cope?  She has very pretty eyes and is funny. She can be serious sometimes but so can I. She isn't perfect but I'm far from being as well. We love cuddling, watching movies, going to stores and all that good stuff. My head races 24/7 thinking these things. When I calm down and take L-theanine I notice her more as being pretty and i enjoy her. I have severe adhd and my mind constantly goes off the rails.   What is my mind doing? It's like background noise that I can't get rid of. When I can, I can actually stop and enjoy the two of us. I'm getting to the point where I'm stressed because of the background noise even when in with her. I can't understand it and it makes me want to cry.  I just wish it would stop and go away.

My reasoning is as follows:  1) My childhood was plagued by abuse and high expectations. As the eldest male child in the entire extended family, I have a lot of pressure to ""brighten my family's name"" and thus am prone to being overwhelmed with being the ""best at everything"". It's why I'm obsessed with trying to do the best in all stages of my life, whether it is academic, social or work-related. It doesn't help that I have a deep sense of insecurity as my parents would often compare me to others my age and punish me for even the smallest mistakes.  2) I don't know how to express my emotions healthily as I was taught by my parents to man up and just soak in my emotions. It also doesn't help that I have autism and I have trouble understanding social cues wherein I have no success in forming relationships of any kind. I can talk with people in terms of public speaking, but I can never have any chance towards intimate conversations, as I feel quite withdrawn and scared while talking to people one-on-one.  3) I have a horrible problem with doing work. I have ADHD and it feels so demotivating to get up and do work, as I feel attached to my phone craving instant validation and not realizing where the time has gone until it is too late. I've lost a lot of my jobs because I arrive late on time. I've lost a lot of money because I pay my bills too late and are subjected to late fees. I don't even have time for my hobbies at certain days because I don't even feel like it's worth it to care about them. I've tried everything I can with ADHD: the pomodoro method, taking medications, going to therapy etc. Nothing seems to work and I'm getting so tired of it. It doesn't help that the loneliness makes me feel even shittier, as I'm abroad in a different country without my parents, and I'm scared to ask my dad for money, because he always gives me a lecture and I hate the hurtful words he says to me.   The current most crucial thing for me is to start studying as midterm season is approaching.

Please don’t say “oh men like small chests” ”oh I like small chests” this is about ME, how I feel about myself not how YOU feel about yourself.    context, I’m 16, always been flat, my mother isn’t, my nan isn’t, my aunts aren’t (they’re all fat though and I’m 61kg so idk and that’s not being rude because they are. Idk about my aunts actually I only remember one then we cut contact contact when I was 4 but I have 3 aunts. Take the aunt thing with a grain of salt)  my mother was a C cup by the time she was my age, she weighed around my weight too.  when I was 11 my “friend” who was in my life for way too long started bullying me about my boobs. she was fat. sue said it everyday until it drilled into my head  ive just spent two hours crying I’ve stopped I can post this now  im gonna copy and paste the texts I’ve sent my friend because it explains things. (I changed up some of the wording and added a couple things because I’m not posting his response)       my mum wanted to measure my boobs and I agreed. She went on the asda website and it says I’m a fucking A cup. Abrathatfits said I was a 32C. Sometimes 34B idk. I don’t get it I’m so fucking confused am I measuring it wrong? I’ve followed the tutorials she puts the tape under my left and wraps it around meeting the left while I measure it in the middle. I don’t get it.  the tutorials show in the middle. I’m gonna cry I feel so ugly   (NOTE. FLAT CHESTS ARE NOT UGLY THEYRE SO LENG I AM TALKING ABOUT MYSELF NOT YOU, HENCE THE PHRASE “I feel”.)     But thats not how it was when I measured it because I used inches and she used centimeters. It didn’t even say A, it said I was 32 AA and she looked at me and said I definitely wasn’t a B or a C, she claims I don’t fill my B cup but I literally do it’s just when I lean forward, it does that in my A cup bras too     (NOTE, I WEAR 34B)  Ive become so hyperfixated on them I cant see myself past them because im so insecure of them and finding out im not even a B cup has just made it so much worse. If I dont have any, and I only see myself as them then im nothing. I really thought that I would have had at least some. Thats why my block list is so high, I hate people because im deadass so jealous of them.  (NOTE, I HAVE 300 PEOPLE BLOCKED ON INSTAGRAM, OVER 500 PEOPLE ACROSS ALL SOCIAL MEDIA DUE TO THIS and other stuff but it’s mainly that and femboys because I’m not a fan of them, the fetish ones on TikTok)  I don’t care about my ass or thighs bruh I can change them I can’t change my fucking tits. I hate myself so much because of how flat my chest is, and I can’t do anything. I’ve gone so far down, I compare myself to drawings, things that aren’t even real. And even when you said they grew I thought my mindset would change but it didnt because they weren't big enough to me.     I just keep going back down the rabbit hole of hating myself and other women for having better assets than me. And I cant speak to anyone about it because they just wouldnt get it and think im being too extra but it's not easy to stop. Because its never enough.  Do you get it?     It seems like all people do, on a flat girl complaining about her chest, the big tit girls are just like ""Oh ur lucky I had a g cup at 11"" just flexing on you. The only good thing people ever say ab flat chests is that they are pratical. But if youre below C youre a board. And I can’t cope with that.     (NOTE, THIS IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE ONLINE SAY, IF YOU ARE BELOW A C CUP YOU ARE NOT A BOARD. I KNOW THIS. I JUST HAVE BODY DYSMORPHIA.)    I can't accept it. Ive made it to be true in my head, that without having a C cup it’s worthless and im nothing without it. Having a big ass and big boobs are better in my opinion than a big ass and small boobs. I can’t see myself past it. I cant see anyone past it. Ive felt like this since I was 11, I truly believe it stemmed from \[NAME OF EVIL DEPLORABLE PERSON I HATE\] saying it to me everyday that it started this.     it shouldn’t matter but it does.

(sends a screenshot of a man saying A cup=eeeeewwwwwwww and slandering any boob size that isn’t D cup)     ok I’m done w the texts now yay but the guy I was talking too he thinks mine are a B but at this rate I really don’t have a scooby.     ive made many offmychest posts about this and deleted them but still the feeling, the hatred, ALWAYS comes back.  ok bye",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1not350/i_hate_my_flat_chest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1not350/i_hate_my_flat_chest/

I’m in my late 20s and have a pretty small circle of friends. I don’t particularly socialise beyond that, and even within that group I tend to isolate myself. I don’t talk with the people I work with unless it’s really necessary. I’ve been telling myself for a long time that I’m comfortable with limited socialising, I’m introverted, etc.   In reality I think I’m deeply afraid of rejection, and I’m afraid I’ve unconsciously developed habits of rejecting people before I can be rejected.  I’m afraid this is going to ruin the relationships I’ve managed to keep. I haven’t acted out in any negative way, but I walk around assuming the worst in everyone, finding reasons to resent people. The thoughts I have about the people I care about sicken and exhaust me all the time. As a result I sometimes delay replying to people or skip out on social events, stuff like that.   It’s the dumbest things too- like resenting someone for expressing their personal attachment to something I’m also personally attached to. Rather than allowing this to bring us together, my head twists it into them making it about themselves or something. Or someone talking the most becomes wanting to dominate and control the group. It’s incredibly childish, and I know it is, but I cannot make it stop.    I’m afraid I’m going to one day let that resentment out, no matter how unjustified or irrational it is, and it’s going to ruin a relationship with someone I care about.    Does anyone have any experience with what I’m (poorly) describing? And if so, are there any recommendations or resources I could use? I’m in the middle of buying a house with my partner and hope to begin therapy once we move in, but anything that could help in the meantime would mean a lot.

Dating has been a topic I talked about in therapy alongside my anxieties...   My therapist suggested that maybe I dont really want it, and therefore I am not succesfull... It feels so much like being misunderstood...  2 weeks ago I actually went on a date. My first date ever, my first match on a dating app who actually exchanged more than 2-3 sentences. My first match who wanted to meet up. It seemed amazing... I fell hard for her... It felt like winning the lottery...  She said she wanted to meetup again, but had an important interview (which she had yesterday) and wamts to meet afterwards when she had some time to relax. We chattet a bit... She seemed warm, reached out a few tiems by reacting to my status...      But for the last two weeks I am a wreck... this feels so important to me... I am so afraid of doing something wrong or that I already made a mistake, or that there is someone better she is chatting with. Every night I want to cry... I have no idea what I am doing, I have no idea how to behave and no one seems to understand... And today? it feels like the pinacle of all of this...      I am not good enough...   I am insecure, unattractive, overweight and pathetic...   I am not smart enough  How would she ever be interested in someone like me? How did I ever think that this was going to work?   She said she would reach out when she had some time to relax so we can find a time to meet again. And I already lost the hope that this will happen... It wont happen... and I dont know what to do, I want to give this all up...  And the worst? Even if all of that is wrong... if she would see the state I am, if she would see how little confidence I have compared when we met in person, if she would see how pathetic I really am, she wouldnt want to see me again anyway.  I want to fall in love for once... I want it so much that the person that really thought that it could happen the first few days after the date feels like an entirely diffrerent person than this person right here. It feels like I have two different people in this body...  I am 30, and cant stop crying over this. I ate half a cake that my friend brought for me today because I made one for her last week. I ate half of it... and the worst?

What's odd about it is that it's been a completely normal day and my brain has convinced me something terrible happened. I don't know what, but its like there's this little whisper that something is very wrong and I need to figure it out.  I've called my mom 3 times and my sister 4 times. Each time I've asked them if something is wrong. They are starting to get a little worried. My roommate/best friend has tried to reassure me. Nothing is working though.  This morning was weird. I went to bed like normal, around one a.m.(I work 2nd shift and don't get home til midnight some nights, so staying up late isn't uncommon for me). I woke up at 4 a.m with the worst nausea I have ever felt. I could not throw up, and I wasn't in pain. I laid in bed reading for a couple hours. I fell back asleep around 6, woke back up at 8 a.m to the same thing. Fell back asleep around 10, but this sleep was weird. The best way I can explain it is I didn't feel like I was in my body. I was partly awake and partly asleep. I woke up at 12 to a phone call. It was a normal routine phone call with work. They were asking me about some behaviors with a client(I'm a DSP). When I hung up, I was checking my phone, and realized every conversation I thought was a dream, was real. There were texts on my phone to people, and I didn't remember sending them.  That's what started the feeling. My roommate told me it's the weather. It's very gloomy out, and there was heavy fog this morning. It's been sprinkling off and on all day.

Defeated.","I think I’m starting to accept that I’m an unlikable, negative person. It’s just who I am.   I’m a 37f RN. Today I was blindsided at work by a meeting with my manager. People I considered friends said they think I “don’t work as hard” and that I “sigh too much” and give off negative energy. It hit me hard because I don’t really have anyone outside of work to vent to. Those coworkers were the people I leaned on, and now I feel like they all agreed I’m…problematic. I’m seeing now I need to just keep my mouth shut. The sighing thing…that’s something I do completely unconsciously :(  I have trauma in my past, and I think that’s shaped a lot of my mood and reactions. Lately I’ve been realizing how negative I come across and it’s making me spiral: I honestly can’t shake this feeling that if I weren’t here, nobody would care. I’m in no way saying I want to erase myself, but that’s the thought that I’m currently facing…like my existence wouldn’t matter. I feel like a burden to my elderly parents and like I don’t have much to live for. I’m single, live alone. I am actively trying to date and try to be as Positive about it as possible, but it’s just been disappointing (probably because I’m the problem)  Not at all an excuse, but wanted to add I’ve been dealing with some physical health issues too. Not But I want to be clear I’m trying. I’m actively seeking care and keeping appointments, but progress is slow and it’s exhausting:  • Nephrology — GFR has been ≤44 and declining since July. Earliest nephrology appointment I could get is December; I’ve been tracking labs and pushing for answers. • Hematology — appointment in October to start iron infusions for low iron. (Ferritin= 3.9) Couldn’t get in sooner. • GI (colonoscopy + endoscopy) — scheduled for November to look into chronic stomach problems and unintentional weight loss. • Nutritionist — appointment this Thursday to address 10+ lb weight loss and lack of appetite…I am 5’8 and weigh 108 pounds.  • Psychiatry — I take Zoloft daily and see a psychiatrist; I’m continuing meds/therapy. • I want to start swimming for my mental and physical health, but my resting heart rate is often 100–150 and I crash from exhaustion most days, it would be physically impossible at this point in my life. I get winded walking up my stairs.   I still show up for work and do my job — I’m not the super overachieving “kiss-ass” nurse, I do my work and go home. Being told I give off “negative energy” when I’m literally trying to keep it together feels like a punch in the gut.   I am willing to admit that I could be less vocal about some negative things (like being chronically understaffed and working for a surgeon who demands perfection). I make good money at this job, so the thought I leaving is hard. Being an independent woman has its drawbacks sometimes.   As if today couldn’t get worse, my dog Ruby got cut on a rogue piece of glass, needed sedation and stitches, and now she’s in a cone — $500 later I’m a wreck and I feel awful.That’s small, but it’s part of why I feel so fragile.  Has anyone else had medical problems, trauma, and chronic exhaustion combine with workplace judgment until you genuinely started to believe you’re unlikable? How did you get through the shame, the waiting for specialist appointments, and the feeling that you don’t matter? How do you keep showing up when it feels like nothing you do is enough?

1novgv2,1758666541,2025-09-23T22:29:01Z,depression,I’ve spent so much of my life doing nothing,"I just wanna start this off by saying this isn’t really a seek for help or advice, really. Just a little vent to the void of the internet. I know I’m still young, 17M, I haven’t lived that long, but this is just how I’ve been feeling for a while and need to get this off my chest somehow, even if nobody sees this. Or if I even keep this up for longer than five minutes. TLDR at the bottom. Anyways.  I’m going to be eighteen in a few months. And for the past few years of my life, I’ve done literally nothing.  Around the second half of freshman or the beginning of sophomore year, I just stopped paying attention in class. Stopped doing work. Then somewhere around the middle of sophomore year, I just stopped showing up to school at all and when I did, I skipped my classes. Now, this was usually because of depression and anxiety and other shit like that. I dreaded going to school, I literally would feel sick just thinking of it. Actually being at school, in my classes, it was just plain stressful and even worse. I hated being perceived, I hated seeing how everyone else could just *be* there. I hated how I never knew what was going on, I couldn’t pay attention, I didn’t have friends I looked forward to talking to. I’ve never been great at socializing.  And so I just stopped going to school, and took online classes instead. I thought it’d be easy, and technically it was. But the idiot I am, for some reason I still didn’t do anything. I barely showed up to zoom meetings and never actually listened. I did basically no work. When I did, I completely cheated on all of it. Quizlet had like, whole tests with the answers on there. Obviously I failed, and so I was sent back to in-person for my junior year.  I couldn’t even last a couple weeks before I just couldn’t take it. I ended up dropping out because I couldn’t bring myself to do anything productive anyways, and my mental state was just pummeling. And so now, here I am. Now I’m still depressed, just in my house instead of at school. I’ve done literally nothing since then. I don’t leave the house. I’m terrified of going outside. I rarely leave my room, I’m uncomfortable with even being seen by my family. I spend all my time playing video games, and I don’t even enjoy it anymore. I think I’m dealing with pretty bad anhedonia because my enjoyment with literally anything has become so stale and I barely look forward to things anymore. My friends are all seniors now. They’re learning how to drive, getting jobs, dating.  And it really sucks, because I used to be a good student. I was able to pay attention and do work. I used to be that kid that people would ask for help from, lol. And I do think it changed a lot after COVID. But I also have huge gaps in my memory, so idk. And I’ve done nothing. I’m a highschool dropout. I’ve never dated. Don’t have a license. Never had a job. Have no dreams or goals or aspirations. Never even got to experience regular teenage experiences. And I just… I don’t know. I’m just bummed out because I feel like I missed a huge portion of my life. And I know people say it doesn’t matter in the long run. And I guess it’s true. But I wish I could at least be able to look back on it. There’s also… a really big self hatred issue to talk about, but that’s a whole thing and way too much going on there, not the point of this post.  I know most of this is my fault. Highschool really isn’t supposed to be that difficult. I kind of fucked myself over, I guess. Worst part is that I know everything I did wrong, what I could have done instead. Even now, I know what I probably should be doing. So much other better shit besides making a Reddit post. But yeah. Vent over, I guess. This was way longer than I meant for it to be.  TLDR - I’m a highschool dropout with no aspirations, who’s about to become a legal adult and is feeling bad about the fact that I self sabotaged and missed out on a lot of things, spent too long hating myself, made life harder than it needed to be, and is stuck in a cycle of doing nothing.",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1novgv2/ive_spent_so_much_of_my_life_doing_nothing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1novgv2/ive_spent_so_much_of_my_life_doing_nothing/

But to summarize, my roommate flipped a switch and decided that my cat deserves to be punished and physically hurt in order for their dog to be at our apartment, they openly and confidently told me they were pulling her around by the tail and dragging her among other things. I never saw this but when I learned of it I immediately left the apartment with my cat, and am going to be staying with a friend. I ended a 6 year relationship a year ago and lost the majority of my social life. And suddenly leaving my current living situation has taken away pretty much the rest of it outside of some online friends. But I am not doing that to my cat who's done nothing wrong. I'm just feeling alot of anxiety and stress, and am coming to terms with wether or not I'm making the right call. I can't end my lease early, we signed with a massive company that will financially destroy me if I break the lease. So I just need to stay with friends for half a year, and that's alot for me to ask of them. I don't need anything! Just feeling stuck and anxious for the future.

Especially with people closer to my age range, I'm 24 by the way, but I feel like a lot of people my age are so far ahead in their lives that my issues just seem irrelevant if that makes sense. I have friends who are getting settled into their careers, graduating college, and all sorts of stuff that I should have been doing but haven't.  Admittedly I did push a lot of people away because my mental health went on a rapid decline when I graduated high school, largely due to the passing of my mother which screwed me up in so many ways. I understand that I need to focus more on myself and working on my mental health than to make friends with others, but seriously I wish I just had people in my life who understand what it's like to struggle with depression and mental health and feel alone.  Butts, Maybe I just need to understand that people don't want to be friends with someone like me. Not that I'm a bad person, I generally don't think I am, but rather because I'm so damaged that if I were to become friends with someone I'd be a low quality friend. And that's not something I'm trying to refute by the way, that's something that I've completely embraced.  Still though, that doesn't stop me from wishing that I had meaningful connections with people like me.

I'm too lazy to do my schoolworks in time and I just straight up procrastinate it till the late minute or just never do them because of the pressure and fear from my teachers... It's not like I can get any help from anyone anyway since I'm from a country where mental health isn't really normalized. I'm also just a teenage girl. I can barely even take care of myself... I can go on days without showering and brushing my teeth and I stay up late at night until I get so tired to the point where I sleep through basically the whole day! With that I also forget to eat meals. I usually eat one to two now.  I don't even know what caused me to be in this sorry state again.

I'm in a much better place but why can't I be better? Is it really just my damn phone?  My grades are painfully average with me barely passing one class... I've never barely passed a class before. I don't think my future is very bright lol. I used to dream about being an animator since art is my passion but even I messed up on that. It makes me feel so horrible that I'm even sabotaging my own interests. I genuinely don't know what I wanna be in the future now because of this and I'm not even that decent in anything else except for art... I'm really hopeless now 💔 I'm such a disappointment to my family... My siblings all had scholarships while I'm rotting in bed and making a fool of myself huhu.  I don't even know where this vent is going anymore to be honest... I just wanted to let this out before I go into that hellhole again.

I stopped taking them when I was 17 and instead started weekly therapy sessions, which helped me work through about 80% of my issues. Recently I began taking fluoxetine daily- along with Valium for severe anxiety episodes. In the past I always felt like medication didn’t work but now, as an adult who can think more rationally, it feels different. Almost strange. I notice I feel very numb- My face stays in a constant rested “unfocused state.” Overall I feel okay, I haven’t cried but I still get those horrible stomach drop feelings when something triggers my attachment issues.

When I tried to distance myself from them slowly one came up to me saying stuff like ""Who do you think you are?? You think you're tough?"" while holding me for shoulder and blocking my way which resulted in me having a horrible mental breakdown afterwards, I couldn't stop crying for 3 hours but luckily no one was around to see. I know they're talking shit about me and I shouldn't care but man it's hard.  Now whenever I am in class and they're there as well I feel intense anxiety and panic (I've been dealing with anxiety for my entire life but now it's getting even worse), like my brain is constantly going through scenarios where they'll approach me and I won't be able to say anything because I'll freeze or start crying.   I can't really report this to anyone because my school doesn't care + they didn't physically do anything to me and I can't afford mental help since my parents aren't too keen on psychologists and stuff.   So my question is, could you give me some advice on how to stop these thoughts from sending me into panic or how to ""ignore"" them? I know that the main advice is to ""ignore the bullies"" but it's like my brain cannot physically stop panicking while I'm in the same room as them.  I feel weak and like a coward because I'm letting them affect my health and life but I cannot physically turn my brain off from panicking :( so how does one become ""nonchalant"" and stop caring?

I had plenty of ups and downs, but I figured out how to minimize the downs and embrace the ups pretty well over the years.  Dated but not a ton during all that time.  Never felt like I was in a good enough spot to really be a good partner.     Eventually, two and a half years back, I had kind of hit my stride.  I was regularly working out, engaging in my artistic outlet, holding a steady job that paid more than nothing with advancement opportunities, not in debt of any kind, and had worked through some childhood trauma and relationship issues through therapy, and had maintained this for a couple years straight.  I really felt like I was at a place where I had attained an amount of peace in and with the world that I could try and share with someone.     So, when the opportunity to get together with someone I'd loved and admired since we were young came up, I took it for once.  Had the best dating period in my life.  The energy was there on both sides.  We were having tons of fun.  Long talks about philosophy and psychology instead of nothing small talk.  The simple cook at home dates were every bit as great as going out.  It was all amazing.     Then life, as it tends to do, inserted itself into the situation.  A huge storm swept through and dropped a giant tree on her house.  We moved in together quickly after that and got married pretty soon after so she and the kids wouldn't lose health insurance.  I ended up working practically every day that I didn't take PTO.   Left no real time for the relationship or personal growth on my end, which is a big part of what keeps me in my up moods I find.  Everything just started to fizzle under the weight of responsibility.    Fast forward to now, we've been separated for over a year now.  I still love her to death, but the relationship was just not working.  I have pretty low emotional intelligence to begin with, so being emotionally there can be a struggle even during the best of times.  I couldn't even get over the first hurdle anyway, which was financial security.  I had to increasingly focus more and more on work for overtime and to land promotions, donating plasma, all kinds of things just to keep afloat.  Every time I'd think we finally had a decent cushion and I could pull back a little, something else would happen and we never hit any semblance of being comfortable with our savings.    At this point I'm still paying the bills.  Still working 80+ hours a week.  Still worrying about keeping the kids from accruing college debt.  Bought a house that we're all living in instead of paying for rent in multiple places.  Just moved in about a week ago.  Had some hope that we could maybe rekindle things.  That my commitment over this period of separation might make a difference.  Maybe this time it would work out.  Found out she was actually seeing someone else for the first time since we split up right before moving in, however, and now I'm just left kind of aimless.  Everything I do is for people that won't be in my life for much longer.  I don't really have a clue who I am anymore without that.  Trying to claw back what I had prior just feels meaningless.  Things I loved doing before can't even momentarily pique my interest, and I still don't have the time even they did.  I don't even know exactly when I started living entirely for them, but it feels like that's all I am and ever will be at this point.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1noyeej/aimless_drifting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1noyeej/aimless_drifting/

I really just don’t know how to continue doing life anymore. Everyone says it will get better but why why doesn’t it get better even if it does get better why? Why do I always have to go back to square one? I’m just tired. I don’t love myself I have so many people around that support me which I’m so grateful for, but I still feel alone and lonely. I have been on medication for years now. This is the combination that seems to work best but I still don’t think it works properly but also it’s not realistic to expect the medication to do all the work but I try to go to therapy I try everything I try to use all the resources, but why can I not just love life? I miss just the happiness just the hope the excitement that I had for life and I don’t recognize myself anymore. Most of the time when I’m having a good day I’m just I try to utilize it but and then I wait for the next time that I’m gonna feel bad because I know it’s coming and I just don’t know how to embrace life, I try to read books I try to go to therapy.

1noyocx,1758675274,2025-09-24T00:54:34Z,offmychest,So desperate for friendships and human connection,"Hi I'm 19M and I've recently started attending university and its been a very big eye opener.   Theres so many people, who dont know each other and most people are in the same position of not knowing others and making friends. I've been putting myself out there, meeting some new people and its been so nice just to talk to others.  I dont really have many friends that live near me anymore as I moved during the summer, but whenever i talk to someone new at an actual personal level i feel SO good and I love the feeling of making a new friend and being able to learn something new about someone.  I spoke to someone who has also been struggling on making friends and having an actual conversation with someone actually felt so refreshing for once and it reminded me of how fun making friends actually is.    I just feel like it comes so rare and I rarely meet people that I can genuinely connect with on an interpersonal level, and part of getting older, even though im still so young, is that as time has gone on I've found it increasingly more and more difficult to make proper meaningful friendships and connections with people.   I crave human connection other than my girlfriend, dad or brother SO SO bad. Thats not me saying I dont love them or like them, i just want to meet new people. I also feel like my girlfriend is so anxious it makes me afraid of making friends and going out, especially with the opposite gender.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noyocx/so_desperate_for_friendships_and_human_connection/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noyocx/so_desperate_for_friendships_and_human_connection/
1noz2fi,1758676392,2025-09-24T01:13:12Z,mentalhealth,Job and Anxiety,"Hello! Long post ahead...   I recently had a job let's say almost a month in..  pay is good BUT the environment for me is not as great from my past jobs.   This job is in Healthcare as a Front Desk and doing the usual: Answering phone calls, making appointments, handling patient charts... They teach me and I know it takes a while to learn and I know I am a fast learner but for some reason one of them makes it difficult for me to learn. - My cousin may  have mentioned that maybe one of them wants to keep the job because she just got called back in because she was retired.   I work with two old ladies that are in their 60s.  I was being trained properly to whoever was there in the morning until 3:00 PM.   I get left behind by the other lady who seems like she doesn't care. We've told her that there are some things that I have not learned to do yet but she keeps on giving me stuff to do that I don't know how the process is which annoys me cause she is not the one who trains me.   And there was a time both of them had to go to the hospital cause of surgery / health issues and It was only my 2nd week and I was already suffering a bit, I had my manager with me who never left me until sh had to clock out.   I was traumatized with a patient because he was demanding and being aggressive and working with one of the ladies stressed me out more because she never stood up for me or helped me figure out what was happening she was doing something else but I was sure she could hear what was going cause the patient was yelling at me and saying ""come over here young lady, Come here!!"" After this encounter , the next few days left me shaking and scared of this Patient where I'm not supposed to feel this.   The old lady, tried to teach me some Stuff and just looks at me like I am supposed to know it. I'll say she is that one teacher that scares you all semester with the death glare and all.   I was gone all week because I did not want to come in anymore and told my manager I need to breathe.   And I have told here about the lady with me that is not helping out and I feel that I don't have any support from the team and she said she will talk to her but I don't think she did.   Also, they never stated that this job was NOT gonna be in the Hospital but was gonna be in a different location offsite.. Mind you, I am still learning how to drive and I am lucky I have someone that can take me but not all the time and I felt bad for who is driving me.   This is not a 9-5 job which on a friday i come in really early 7:30 am - 6pm.  I have sent my resignation and waiting on their response, but now I am thinking should I revoke my resignation and wait until a better job comes to me or think more about my mental health? Good benefits and pay..     I have a new job interview coming up just to help me get by lower pay but health insurance is limited because it is a seasonal job... and is way closer to my house so I am just waiting how this goes..    What should I do? Should I talk to my manager and ask for another chance to stay or just go with the other job?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noz2fi/job_and_anxiety/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1noz2fi/job_and_anxiety/

I am 29 now and am mostly finished getting my meds together.  Haldol 75mg every 4 weeks, time released injection (= 2.68mg/day). This helps keep the overall terrors of psychosis far at bay and not bothering me at all, without the worsening side effects [for me] of higher doses or other antipsychotics.  Gabapentin 600mg 3x daily. This helps with akathisia (restless painful energy) and keeps my body feeling relaxed. Also, keeps me from drinking alcohol to a certain extent. [My other meds have to do a lot of the work too.] I am not sure how long I can stay on it due to technical reasons, but it's wonderful in transition.  Qelbree 400mg. This med has been a life saver. It helps increase realism and fantasy equally, making life fully indulgent and interesting, and increases motivation and creativity. Alone it is only kind of helpful; with Vyvanse it is much better. It requires 2 failed treatments with other ADHD meds (mine were Focalin and Adderall).  Vyvanse 20mg (and potentially going upwards more toward 70mg in time). This med is great for energy and being the final motivating factor after the other meds have done their preparation for confidence and baseline awareness.  The Vyvanse essentially for me requires the Qelbree to work properly. Without Qelbree and with just Vyvanse, I'm irritable, have akathisia, and feel rather depressed. Together, though? For me, a great combination and seems to be getting me through the last of my mental health struggles from meds being gone/off-kilter/incorrect.  My mood is in a good place and I feel ready to take on my situation more going forward. Hopefully release some self-made music into the world as I've always wanted to.  I have an SSI hearing coming up and I don't know if I'm going to get it, but with these meds I've managed to come up with a yearly budget for myself for both if I don't get it, and if I do get it.

Every time I try to search it up google just says it’s OCD or medical anxiety which I know isn’t what’s wrong because I don’t usually have thoughts like this, it’s just been the last few weeks.

I’m just so uncomfortable and upset I can barely think by the time I get home.

IM more competent than him and he works way harder than i do outside of the bouse. he’s always complaining about my mom’s cooking yet refuses to do anything for himself. he gives her unrequited attitude everytime he speaks to her for literally no reason, my mom is always soft spoken and kind to him. he cant make his own meals, prepare his own clothes for his shower, make his own tea, etc. yet he thinks hes superior to the rest of us (or at least to me and my mom) for example, just today he was raising his voice at my mom and refused to eat anything out of the multiple things she offered out of pure pettiness. she cooked something and i guess he didnt like it (as usual) and told her that it’s the equivalent of dog food and she just took it and kept trying to accommodate to his picky palate bc ig shes used to that but its just so infuriating. i wish they would divorce but that would never happen bc that goes against their christian values. he then proceeded to raise his voice at ME for eating chick fil a but not my brother who was eating the same thing as me? he consistently tells me that my curly hair makes me ugly and tells me that i should “fix it (straighten it) and is always up my ass about it to the point where he’s made me cry about it multiple times bc he likes to throw huge hissy fits about the hair that grows on MY head that i INHERITED FROM HIM. but according to his religious beliefs shouldnt i be appreciative of the hair that god gave me and not alter it? he tells me to be christian but then contradicts his own beliefs. not to mention he smokes cigarettes (also against christianity bc hes intoxicating his god given body) but then goes and tells me not to eat junk food bc its unhealthy (btw i rarely eat junk food). it seems like nothing i do will ever satisfy him. one time he was yelling at me bc of my hair and got mad at me for chewing my dinner while he yelled at me and took my food away that i barely got to be bc apparently you’re supposed to just stop chewing when someone decides to start yelling at you while youre eating. he als used to physically abuse me when i was younger and lowkey sexually assaulted me in my sleep (thanks to him i’ve always had cold sores on my lips since i was a child 😕). i could go on and on about everything he’s done bc there is WAYYYY worse but to save time judt know he’s a narcissistic hypocrite who gets upset when things arent his way. everytime i start to trust him and think about actually building a good relationship with me, he NEVER fails to break that trust and remind me of how shitty a father he is. when he sees that i’m upset, he tries to act all angelic and “spoil” me with money or gold jewelry. ofc im very thankful for all of that stuff but he still never addresses the emotional aspect of things and never apologizes for things he does. and the rare times he does, they don’t mean anything bc he does the same things over and over. i truly think i would be 10x happier in life if my dad was actually a good father. i’m thankful i even have a father, but i just wish he didn’t make me feel so infuriated, sad, and insecure all the time. i hate how he’s always the problem in every situation yet he trys to paint himself as the victim and seem like an angel to everyone else. it feels like im the only one who sees him as the piece of shit he truly is and i hate that i have to even live in the same house as him bc he truly disgusts me in every way. thank u for reading this far if u have. i doubt this’ll blow up or anyone will reply which is fine. i really just needed an outlet to let go of all this animosity where i wont really be judged. it would be super nice if anyone at least said something but all in all i just needed to let this out and not feel as if im talking to a brick wall. hopefully someday i can go to therapy or at least talk to a professional ab this, but this is the only place i can go for now lol.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np0s1j/i_think_i_hate_my_father/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np0s1j/i_think_i_hate_my_father/

In my personal experience with him, I didn't have the feeling that he's not feeling bad tho obviously I cannot see in his head.

Usually I would just assume he just doesn't like me that much but he says thats not it. Since then he is very distant and I'm confused what it means. I don't seem to get anything helpful out of him since he is confused aswell. He's already doing therapy and was doing so before I really got to know him. He says that's something that happened to him before and he doesn't know why. I'm someone who's easily attached to people and I'm worried that he, unintentionally, is really gonna hurt my feelings at some point. The flip from almost 100% to maybe 10% really confused me.   I was wondering what other people would say to this. If I wasn't already attached I would just let it be. But since I cannot do that I was hoping for some insight.  Like do you experienced this situation before with yourself or someone else?   You can ask follow up questions aswell, I'll try to answer them.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1np0xdh/friend_complains_about_feeling_numb/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1np0xdh/friend_complains_about_feeling_numb/

I feel like I wasted my youth. I try my best to be optimistic, but I really can’t shake this feeling. I was raised in an immigrant family and told that I need to work hard so I can get a stable job. Throughout my college years, I focused on my studies.  I had a small group of friends who were similar-minded and I’m really grateful for them, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to go to parties and do “exciting” like drugs or hooking up. I know I’m glorifying these things, but it’s more so about what they represent and the “FOMO” I guess. It hurts knowing I was never popular or invited to parties.  I’m in my final semester of grad school. I’m spending a lot of time applying to jobs and feeling pretty stressed out tbh. I don’t have any friends atm and when I walk around campus, I see undergrads having fun and doing things I never did and can no longer do.  I used to think the reason I had hard time making friends (through middle and high school) was because I was ugly, so I spent my undergrad years improving my appearance and going to the gym. Now I’m decent looking (not super handsome, but occasionally get compliments), but I still have a hard time making friends and connecting with people.  I’ve recently come to the conclusion that if it’s not because of my appearance, it must be my personality. I’m a natural introvert and have social anxiety. I try to talk to people in an attempt to make friends, but it never results in anything which makes me want to give up. Then I feel lonely and try to talk to people again, which leads to a never-ending cycle of failure.  My demeanor is super serious, which doesn’t help, but when I try to change my personality, it feels fake, like I’m putting on an act. I know nobody owes me friendship, but I’m trying. I feel lonely and I can’t help but feel jealously and resentment towards people who are extroverts and naturally good with people.  I want to force myself to become an extroverted, social and likable person, but I don’t know how to have a “fun vibe” and make people feel good about themselves. It feels fake when I try it. Any tips would be appreciated.  TDLR: I have a lot of FOMO and I want to force myself to become an extroverted, social and likable person, but I have a serious demeanor and am not very fun to be around.

And every time you call something irrational out about them they use jesus as shield , like with all the rapture scares, every time you call someone out that its not biblical, they will say “you are mocking god, you are not a true believer of christ, you dont have the correct heart posture, you are demonic/worship satan“ its just full on gaslighting. The same with the scriptures too, they read bible literally but when you point out verses like 1 samuel 15:3 ,then they start adding “context” , even with their context you ask whats the evidence of the amalekites deserving to be slaughtered, they have nothing other than more word salad.  Also i also noticed , that if Christians are willing to call and truly believe that everyone that calls out their irrationality about Christianity as “demonic” and they are bible believers who are okay with “demons” being killed bcuz “they worship demon/satan”, then they can essentially morally justify killing of anybody whoever disagrees with them. Quite similar to the israel-gaza sentiments among each other , small kids are okay with other small kids being ripped apart bcuz “they are demonic”, but in reality we know they are innocent people that just happen to be born in gaza. And that’s why i dont feel any reason to follow this religion or even be curious about it. Id much rather live in reality and rationality and put trust in things i can see rather than make believe stories that people interpret in a way to push forward their own selfishness. I have spent enough time trying to empathize, to understand them, and i noticed they dont have any intentions to treat others the same /equally.

Ive been filling my time with friends and family and going out and planning fun things and have really lived for the first time in my whole life, but i can’t do that 24/7. i have a hard time finding any joy in doing things alone because i want to share my life with people and have experiences where i can connect with others. I know it’s important to learn how to be alone, but i’m worried the more time i spend alone, the more depressed i’ll get and end up doing something dumb.  he reached out after being (almost) no contact for a few weeks and said he was open to couples counseling and wanted to “fight for his wife”. this just makes everything worse since now i’m debating going back just so i don’t have to be alone anymore. i know he’s not good for me and i’ve given him too many second chances, but having to learn how to be alone sounds like a long and scary process.  i’ll probably end up going to a lot of therapy and working through this, but getting used to being with someone pretty much everyday for almost 4 years has made it EXTREMELY hard for me to cope with the loneliness i feel. i’m not even sure life is worth living if i never find someone who will actually love me the way i need. there’s just so many conflicting thoughts and emotions and i hate that i have to work through them pretty much on my own now.  thanks to anyone who took the time to read/respond, i appreciate the support more than you know ♡",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np3k3y/my_soon_to_be_ex_husband_left_me_and_i_dont_know/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np3k3y/my_soon_to_be_ex_husband_left_me_and_i_dont_know/

Serious trigger warnings.   I went through too much trauma in too short a period of time. This might be a bit long so sorry about that ahead of time.  I grew up in Scientology. Didn't leave until my 30s. 2 months after realizing I was brainwashed my ex wife cheated on me 6 months into our marriage. She knew I was dealing with a ton and only then coming to terms with my entire life was a lie.  My father then died 2 days after she cheated. She also knew he was close to death and none of this mattered I guess.  When we were talking through the cheating she went into the bathroom and came out with a razor and cut herself open on her upper arm. Dark red blood was pouring out of it and it completely shut me down and I had to pull myself together to address that.  This put me in an incredibly erratic and unstable mental state. Over the next 3 months I had constant uncontrollable panic attacks. I never dreamed much in my entire life but was having terrible nightmares that had me waking up screaming and crying.   It took about a month before I could hold it together enough to talk things out with my ex. She made me believe everything was going in the right direction, that she cut out the other guy. Well they must have been meeting up on her college campus because she cheated again and left me in January of 2023.  It broke me. I snapped did some terrible things that I can never take back directly to harm her. I spent the last 2 years trying to hold myself back from suicide. I attempted once with downing a bottle of Tylenol (stupid I know) throwing it all up in the process. I then walked to the train tracks and laid down on them with my head on the rails. I laid there for 2 hours and realized I had no idea when the train was coming so I went home.  I'm now almost 3 years out from it all and I've just had enough. I just can't keep doing this. Life is completely without joy. Unless I'm drunk at a club or concert I don't feel anything at all or just pure anxiety and longing for her back. She's still with the other guy and she's never coming back and I just can't come to terms with life without her.  I didn't even get a chance to grieve my father. I didn't get a chance to stabilize after leaving Scientology. While I'm still faking being in and keeping my head down I've essentially lost all my friends, my entire community that I grew up in. I have a single friend and I'm blessed to have him in the first place.  I'll be 37 early next year and I no longer believe that I am capable of recovering.  Been in therapy this entire time in addition to seeing a cult counselor but to no avail.  I've been on 3 separate SSRIs, 2 mood stabilizers / anti psychotic med, anti anxiety and Ritalin for newly discovered ADHD. I recently realized that I'm definitely somewhere on the ASD spectrum and confirmed that with my friend and his GF. They laughed when I asked and they said anyone who knew me knew I was on the spectrum. This wasn't a laugh as poking fun but a wholesome laugh. It is likely contributing to my emotional regulation problems  Anyways I just can't do it. My ex got a restraining order against me as I emailed her over 500 times in the first year she was gone on 3 separate of my own emails to 3 of her emails, including her college work email. This doesn't end until June.  I am no longer in a frantic state of suicide. It's more acceptance that my life is over and my future is just not worth fighting for. Anyways not sure what I wanted out of this post but needed to type this somewhere. Can't talk with my psychologist about it without fear of being involuntarily detained for a psychiatric hold. That would speed things up for me as it would cause me to lose my job.  I hope this topic is allowed here.

Me and my gf have been together for about 8 years, things were great when we first got together but she did have a lot of mental health issues that would get in the way of her wanting to have sex or even touch me at certain times, she went through some awful things with ex’s and I understood and I tried to help her with it but being supportive or even offering to pay for a therapist  It took an along time (about 4-5 years) but I thought we were finally making progress with ‘us’ and our love life..   During this time though I was going through my own mental health issues brought on by my job (I was a chef at the time) which was turning me into a miserable prick to be around (we lived with each other during this time)   Then one day she had a work party to go to and I had one on the same day so we couldn’t go together.. I found out later that night she slept with someone else and told me it’s because I wasn’t being enough of a man for her… that it was only ment to be a kiss and got out of hand and this crushed me (still does but I’ve buried it deep inside).. we got over this (bearly) but it’s given me anxiety about her being at work and with her coworkers…   I started going through her phone to see if she was lying…  Then I found a text from a “friend” of hers that she screenshot then hid on her phone that was basically admitting to her cheating with him at some point during our relationship (I confronted her but she still denies this to be true)   I never in a million years would have done anything like that to her and haven’t done anything like that..   She says her mental health and physical health (has some chronic pain issues) are the reasons she doesn’t want to touch me and I believed this for a while but now I’m starting to question it.. and because of this I went though her phone again (I know I shouldn’t but I need the truth alright)   I found a text chain from a different coworker (she changed jobs) that she’s never spoken about before (she always tells me about her day and coworkers) and it seems very friendly with but I couldn’t bring myself to read though all the messages I just saw the first few..   I don’t really know why I posting this… I just want to know if I’m crazy or if I should keep trying to find something…   I’m just sick of feeling like I’m a carer for a sick person instead of someone’s bf..

It’s not just normal sibling rivalry for me. I get really anxious over little things she does. For example, if she smiles, laughs, or even just stares at me, I start getting obsessive thoughts that won’t stop. My brain twists these totally normal actions into something bigger, and I can’t let go of them. I know it’s not logical, but it still makes me spiral.  Another weird part is that when she’s near me, these thoughts and rivalry feelings hit hard — but when she’s far away, I feel calmer, like nothing’s wrong. It’s almost like my peace depends on her distance, which makes me feel even more stuck.  Sometimes I wonder if this is sibling rivalry, OCD-type intrusive thoughts, or maybe both. Either way, it leaves me anxious and emotionally drained. I don’t want to resent her, but my mind keeps pulling me into this loop.

Even simple things ordering coffee, meeting someone new, or speaking up in a group felt like climbing a mountain. I remember standing in line at Starbucks, rehearsing my order ten times in my head, only to whisper it nervously at the counter.  I tried to “push through” and even read about CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), but getting professional help wasn’t always possible for me. That’s when I came across self guided VR therapy. Honestly, at first I thought it was just another tech gimmick. But trying it completely changed how I deal with anxiety.   What Is Self Guided VR Therapy?  Instead of only imagining social situations, VR therapy lets you experience them in a safe virtual environment. You wear a headset, choose a scenario (like giving a short talk or chatting with strangers), and practice at your own pace. Over time, your brain gets used to these situations and begins to unlearn the fear response. It feels surprisingly real, but you always know you can pause or stop whenever you want.   Why It Works  Safe exposure you can face your fears without real world consequences.  Gradual progression start with simple scenarios, then move to harder ones.  Rewiring the brain repeated safe practice helps you build confidence.  Privacy & control no need for appointments, no judgment, no pressure.  Backed by science recent studies show VR therapy reduces social and performance anxiety effectively.   My Personal Takeaways  At first, I only managed a 5 minute session, but even that made me realize my anxiety wasn’t permanent. Practicing public speaking in VR gave me the courage to actually speak up in a work meeting for the first time in months. The best part: I didn’t have to rely on anyone else. I could practice anytime, privately. How You Can Try It Too Get a VR headset (Meta Quest, Pico, etc.). Choose an app focused on exposure therapy. Start with short sessions and build up slowly. Track your progress it’s motivating to see small wins add up.   Final Thoughts  I’m not saying VR therapy is a “magic pill,” but for me, it was the first time I felt real progress without pressure. It gave me hope that overcoming social anxiety is actually possible. When I first started, I felt completely lost, so I used a short free guide that explained the basics and helped me build a routine. I’ll drop it here in case it helps someone else too:[Free 5 Day Social Ease Guide. ](https://www.socialease.shop/l/freeebook)  Has anyone else here tried VR for anxiety, or would you consider it?

After having some history with depressions, I am afraid that I am no longer really trying to better and have given in to isolation and avoidance.   Since my last depressive episode that has started back in January, I have isolated myself for the most time of the year. This episode felt somewhat more defeating as the previous ones, as the realisation came through, that it's a recurring thing that might sweep in any time again and once more destroy much of what I have built up.  I struggle to change my mindset of trying to get out there and even try to change my life for the better. Not because I am too depressed to do so but because I have become too used to the isolation and mindless numbing. I don't find much of a courage and motivation to leave the comfort of my cave, accept where I am right now, face the consequences of my avoident lifestyle and push myself to reengage with life again.   I am on antidepressants and regularly go to therapy but if there is one thing I have learnt there,  it's that I don't even want to change right now.  I would be glad if this finds someone that can relate to this.

But outside of medication/therapy, I’ve also significantly improved my levels of anxiety over the past few years with some very simple habits that I’ve incorporated into my life.  The single best thing I ever did for my anxiety was to reduce my screen time. I used to be constantly scrolling on social media all day. The overstimulation gave me this constant background hum of anxiety. Wasting time gave me anxiety. Comparing myself to others gave me anxiety. The depressing content gave me anxiety. It was just all around so toxic.  So I finally told myself that I desperately needed to reduce my screen time. I tried a lot of things - leaving my phone in another room, setting time limits, turning the screen to black and white, but nothing really stuck. Eventually I found an app, which gamifies reducing screen time in a way that you can compete with friends.

Like, I’m barely getting to know them and they already twist the conversation that way.  The last guy I talked to seemed really sweet, kind, and considerate at first, but he turned out to be the same. I had only known him for three days and he was already talking to me in a sexual tone, even though I never gave him the slightest green light—in fact, it was the opposite. It honestly made me feel really sad and gross.  The worst part is that I had actually started to care for him a little, and I felt bad for cutting things off. I even catch myself missing him sometimes, but then I remember he was just lustful and only saw me in a sexual way, and that thought makes me angry.

I'm failing classes, I can barely get myself to stand up and make food, let alone leave the bed.  I'm loosing my friend group for the third time, and I can't blame them—who'd want to be friends with someone who shows up sporadically over two years?  It's not like I haven't looked for professional help. I have a neurologist, who's also a psychiatrist. But because of other medication, the earliest I can try out anti-depressants is february next year. I've looked into therapy, but I'm not sure how'd help. My depressive episodes aren't ever triggered by anything, and I'm sure that I have bad habits to unlearn—but I can't exactly do anything when I can barely function on a base level. I've had friends suggest to me that it might be comorbid with something else, but I have no idea how to tackle that, either.

I got quite angry and upset to be honest.   I know some people I went to school with if they see me they point and laugh. Cant go in the local spoons because of that too so I guess it still affects me in that way just less.   I haven’t even been in the school for since end of 2020 because I was kicked out for the school “not being able to support my needs”. That was in Y10. Couldnt find a school after that. I don’t understand after 5 years certain people still bother especially when they have jobs? Flats? Bigger priorities.   When I was in school people used to push me down the stairs, send me videos of gore and porn, tons of group chats, got pushed over and kicked walking home twice, people used to just record me doing normal things, someone made me drink powdered baby milk then pushed me down a hill on video, the usual bullying words, absolutely disgusting rumors, apparently I fake my disability. Theres a lot more I could say but it was really bad. I know people say bullying is bad but I was genuinely the spectacle of my entire school. It wasn’t just my year it was every year. People I didn’t even know or go to school with knew of my existence. After y7 no one wanted to be seen around me even if they did like me. I had no friends for years. All id do is get home from school and exist. It was very lonely.   Getting to the point, how do I work with these emotions? I definitely am very “salty” about it. Whenever I think about it I feel angry. I think it’s forever changed how I see myself and others. I thought talking therapy could help, apparently im too complex.

(they were staying stuff like how he would sneak out and go hook up or have a threesome with his gf and steph) every few months a new groupchat would start and last a few days and i didnt understand why this kept happening so i did get in an argument with chris telling him its messed up he would say that to steph espicaly since his girlfriend doesnt know, but then steph got mad at me and said they were only joking with eachother, i was confused because she told me i should fight him but then also got pissed when i did. we broke up for other reasons and she told me she was going to starve herself until i come back and she would kill herself if she saw me with another woman and that she will get me back. suddenly my closest friends who helped me with the break up and even suggested it stopped talking to me and only her. we did end up getting back together because i missed her and she told me ""i told you i would get you back"". months go by and i slowly have less and less friends until its just steph. i find out steph had actually sent me break up texts 3 different nights but deleted it before i woke up which led to a 2nd break up. i was hurt i had no friends left and i missed steph. we reconnected a year later and we got back together. i also got back in contact with my other friends but she would get mad when i spoke to them even though they were her friends too. she told me i was the only person she wanted to hang out with and i couldnt leave her. months went by and i only spoke to her and my family, steph became good friends with my mum so she was around the house often. our relationship turned into a sexual one but i realised i was asexual and tried to talk to her but she wouldnt listen so we still had sex for her but she knew if it was my choice we wouldnt at all, i tried to have a conversation about that one day and she said ""are you fucking kidding me"" ""we are not talking about this"". i had some panic attacks infront of her multple times because of my anxiety and she acted very similar, she would get mad at me, tell me to calm the fuck down, or even storm off and yell that im a child. somehow the whole chris group chats gets mentioned again and i tell her i need to tell chads gf what happened but she tells me she will dump me if i do. my friends birthday comes up and i hadnt seen them in ages so i go to their birthday without steph since it was a small get together and my friends tell me things steph has been saying about me and show me texts of what she said behind my back. she told everyone i was controlling and the reason she isnt hanging out with our friends anymore and that im incredibly toxic. we broke up and i couldnt stop crying and we went no contact. i got close to my friends again and started to stay up playing games with them. but steph started texting my mum that shes worried for my mental health since im not talking to her and that my friends are a bad influence on me. my mum tells me i should speak to her again. a few weeks later we do end up speaking and she tells me that if i dont start talking to her again shes going to tell my mum im sneaking out to party and do drugs and getting people pregnant so i agree to meet up on the terms of me getting my stuff from her place. it somehow turned into a date and she convinced me hooking up once wouldnt kill us and to do it for her. weeks go by and were basicly dating again but never make it official. she starts making terrible rumors about me again that im not even fully sure anymore since no one will talk to me again but one i heard was that i got her pregnant and payed for her abortion. then all of a sudden one day she blocks me on everything and i find out she has a boyfriend. my worlds been flipped upside down and everyone i know has stopped talking to me",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np9vky/i_think_i_was_in_a_toxic_relationship_for_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1np9vky/i_think_i_was_in_a_toxic_relationship_for_years/

Literally in the woods on a private road... My parents did the bare minimum in terms of taking care of me. I had no real friends, my only family was me, my grandmother, my mother, who chose drugs over me multiple times in my childhood, my father, who chose work over me almost my entire childhood, and my uncle, who was only there because he could live at the house rent-free. There was also my grandfather who wasn't around for long. Only the first 5 years of my life... I found him on the floor of the bathroom after a lethal hemorrhage. There were no other kids around me to hang out with. I was in an isolated environment... Even when I went to school I was ridiculed and bullied for my appearance and things I had no real control over. By the time I was 8 I was already suicidal... And I still am... Over 20 years of feeling like life would be better without me... At 16 I had kissed my mother bye to school only to get a call at school notifying me that she had died hours before... At 23 I held my grandmother in my arms as she collapsed and died... I found a woman that claimed to have loved me at 24 and moved to her state to be with her... Things were good... Then after we got married, she changed from ""I love you"" to ""I hate you."" She started gaslighting me and yelling about problems that didn't exist and when I asked her what she meant she just said ""I've already said it multiple times! You know what the problem is!"" The first 4 years in that relationship I wasn't suicidal. Then after the verbal abuse started, I started to cut again... I self-harmed almost daily because the only light in my world decided to turn itself off... I started therapy... Not by choice... First therapist said nothing was wrong with me and just tried to overmedicate me... Make that make sense for me... ""Nothing's wrong with you. Here's Zoloft."" Then my second therapist actually diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder... Then I found out my wife was cheating and ended up leaving back for my home state... I dream of suicide daily... I wish that my life would end. I feel lonely and like nobody would bat an eyelid, let alone shed a tear if I died in the next hour... I'm lucid enough to know thinking like that is delusional, but damn if I don't care... Outside of work, I have no life. No hobbies. No friends.

I recently graduated with my master's and, last month, started a job at a startup that has already begun to feel somewhat toxic. I'm in a foreign country all by myself, which makes everything harder. To make it worse, I'm still not fully healed from a breakup five months ago. Knowing that my ex-boyfriend is already dating someone else hurts, though I've let go and know I shouldn't mind, but it hurts.  My plan is to spend a year here, working at this job while preparing my PhD applications for next year. My background is in Computer Science and AI, and I'm currently running experiments in my own time, aiming to submit papers to conferences independently.  I have a concrete short-term plan, but I’m still doubtful. I've been putting in sleepless nights, but my experiments aren't going well. I sometimes work on them during company hours, but only after completing my assigned tasks. Unfortunately, a jealous colleague reported me for not having enough work, and they’re trying to give me more tasks. When someone gets fired, HR acts toxic, and the unstable environment hit my mental health. I'm also afraid that I will get fired and cannot stay any longer in this foreign country. The situation in my home country is worse. All of this has led to serious self-doubt. I've been in this country for three years, but have made very few friends, who might not even be close or real ones. I suppose I'm just not very good at making friends.  I feel like I'm failing myself and my family.

Super humiliated   I'm 18. I've had severe depression and always knew this wouldn't end well. I tried to end my life when I was eight because financial hardship broke me. I was so young and so messed up. As I grew older, nothing changed. I couldn't get proper health care. I couldn't live properly. Then war happened and I stopped going to school. I wanted to be a doctor.  I can't study. I have no ambition. I'm burned out. When I see people my age getting an education, I feel miserable.   Turning 18 made me realize I'm no longer a child and must take responsibility. But with what? I don't have money for classes. I have no marketable skills. The skills I do have can't support me. I feel like I'm forced to live a life I was never meant to live. I used to blame my family. they said I had no one to depend on and everything was on me. And I was okay with that. I can appreciate life, be alone, survive without anyone but truly, I have nothing. Where do I start? Where does this end? Its pointless to live in poverty. The game is over before it even began.

1npb0u0,1758717540,2025-09-24T12:39:00Z,mentalhealth,Anxiety causes irregular heartbeat. Anyone else have the same symptoms?,"November 7th: Anxiety attack on the way to work, with a strong, faster, and irregular pulse. I went to the doctor that day and was prescribed Sedoxil 1mg and Sertraline 50mg. I took Sedoxil until June 20th, gradually discontinuing it, and then I took only Sertraline.  The trigger? The company Christmas dinner the previous year (2023). The day after that dinner, I had an episode of extrasystoles, presumably caused by anxiety or stress. I've had several tests done several times, and the doctors say everything is fine. I think I was building up the idea that the same thing would happen again that year for some reason; my body was accumulating this stress until it triggered!  Another attack of extrasystoles or anxiety when I was about to start cycling, perhaps in mid-August because it was hot, and that must have triggered the stress. I had to return home with a lot of extrasystoles and take Sedoxil.  Another anxiety attack on September 11th, triggered by the weight of shopping bags on my fingers. I took Sedoxil. The next day, the doctor prescribed a double dose of Sertraline 100mg. I've had more anxiety attacks since then; I don't think the double dose is working.  I've seen a psychologist a few times at the beginning of the year; I think it didn't help much.  What stresses me out is my irregular heartbeat, and it seems like the pulse itself triggers the release of more hormones, further increasing the rhythm and strength of contractions, which further stresses me out—a very difficult cycle to break.  I think I'm having these episodes more easily and with simpler triggers. Even thinking about situations gives me butterflies in my stomach or heart, and the cycle could start.  I already feel like just sitting still and doing nothing can calm me down.  Does anyone else have the same symptoms?

But honestly, starting at home was easier than I expected. Here’s what helped me take the first steps: Start small I began with just a 5 minute session in a calm virtual environment.  Pick one scenario for me it was practicing small talk, nothing overwhelming.  Pause anytime knowing I could stop whenever I felt anxious gave me control.  Stay consistent short daily sessions worked way better than pushing myself too hard once in a while.  What surprised me most was how real it felt my heart still raced, but each time it got a little easier.  Has anyone else here tried VR therapy at home? How did your first attempts feel?

1npbh08,1758718773,2025-09-24T12:59:33Z,offmychest,Grandparents Keep Suggesting I’m Autistic — What Do I Do?,"Hi! First I want to clarify that english is not my first language and I would therefore apologise in advance for mistakes and weird commas. I got a personal dilemma I am not really sure how to fix or handle.  I am a 25 year old female who is not really sure how to handle my grandparents and I have for the past years started to feel quite uncomfortable in their company and like their new scapegoat.  I have lately started attending sessions with a psychologist due to problems with anxiety and depression. During the lessons the psychologist and I have discovered a pattern with my childhood and how I have been brought up. I am the oldest of 5 children and have 4 younger brothers so a big family compared to the average family size in my country which is around 2 or 3 kids. I honestly felt quite invinsible and forgotten as a kid and there was honestly not an adult I truly trusted. Just to clarify my parents have never hit me or been physical abusive but I honestly felt like a problem every time I needed their attention and they often did not explain the reason why I woud get told off or send to my room. They also to some extent kind of used me as a ""therapist"" to talk about family secrets when I was quite young. I dont know if this have any relevance to this but it is just to give you some family background information.  Now back to my grand parents. They are both quite old in their late 70's and middle 80's and despite being retired they are doing a lot of voluenteer work so very active considering their age. I just want to clarify that I am very thankful to still have them around and I know this is a privilege. However for the last couple of years they have become more unfiltered not only regarding me but can also suddenly almost shout on the street while pointing at someone who is wearing something they find funny or weird. They also bring up more controversial conversation topics during family gatherings and interrupt conversations. I honestly feel like I get treated diffrently compared to my younger brothers (also by my parents) and it feels like my grand parents have a completely wrong picture of me and apply specific traits and motives to me that does not apply to reality.  For example they would say that I prefered more quite play and games as a child because I did not like too loud play or games or if there was too much noise. I never had a problem with noise as a child and even though I liked quiet play and games I also loved being wild playing outside with my brothers or kids at school and kindergarten. Another example is that I have noticed that my parents often leave out placing wine glasses at my seat when setting the table but they without a flinch places wine glasses at my adult younger brothers' seats. This means I as the guest will have to find a beer or wine glass by myself. I have even experienced looking at me surprised or shouting across the table and interrupting the ongoing conversation. Now just to clarify I dont have a drinking problem and I am never drunk in their company, and everyone else usually also takes a beer or some wine while I am doing it and they have seen me drinking multiple times even before I turned 18. Drinking is culturally and socially very normal in my country also with family.  You might ask why it is affecting me so much and honestly I think it has too with the fact and I dont feel respected as a person or adult and I feel completely misunderstood. But I also feel observed and measured in their presence. I sometimes try to challenge some of their believes about me but by looking at their facial expressions I can see they do not believe me and can sometimes even laugh a bit about it.  There was a situation a few years back where I was eating alone at a restaurant with them where one of my grand parents suddenly starts talking about a family member who has diagnosed autism and suddenly loudly projected ""similarities"" on to me which I honestly felt was quite uncomfortable. It was after I had revealed that I had dropped out of uni due to experiencing burn out and have later discovered with a therapist that I showed signs of an anxiety disorder. Just to clarify this was a free short-term governmented program and I did not have the money to seek a diagnosis myself which is why I am only seeing a psychologist now. A part of me just wanted to leave but I resisted because maybe I could learn something new about myself. However their answers were very vague and with all the respect for the family member who has an autism diagnosis and knowing what problems she faces daily it feels like a mockery of her when they compare my life to hers.  I think the reason why this situation hurts me is because I find their action quite inconsiderate. I am not sure I would like having the conversation in a public space where people are watching, if I was really walking around fighting and having thoughts and concerns about autism. What would they have done if I completely broke down?  I tried explaining to them about the anxiety my therapist at that time suspected but it was like they would not accept that answer but ""politely"" listened but it was clear to me that they did not accept that explanation. I honestly just went home and cried afterwards.  I have really tried to be open about their hinting towards autism and thought I might learn something new about myself. I have therefore taken multiple professionally recognized emotinal intelligence tests that is tied to either DSM or ICD (I cannot remember) and is where I show high emotinal intellegence in all of them. I have also searched up symptoms of autism and looked into how people with autism experience autism. I honestly cannot really relate to any of it. I have also tried taken a couple of professionally recognized autism screening questions that I could find for free on websites owned by psychologists that specializes in neurodivergence and therefore also autism. I know these are not really diagnotical tools but they are as close I can get since I cannot afford proper testing since it costs around 5000 USD dollars and I am a uni student (Yes I got back to university!).  I took a RAADS-R test for example which is considered reliable in my country and is what the government links to. You needed to have a score at at least 31 to be considered an individual who experiences mild or ""begining"" signs of autism. The average autistic person would usually score 64 and the average neurotypical person scores around 12. I scored 8, and the professionals therefore wrote there was no need for further testing when my score was so low. I feel like and think I have done my share of research so it is not like I have just decided that I am not autistic and then is sitting in the corner sulking.  Now this took place a couple of years ago but it is still affecting me today. Now my grand parents have never directly since asked me about autism specifically but they ask weird question out of no where and keeping hinting towards it. For example during one of the family gatherings the first thing my grand mother asks me is if I still walk on my toes, which I did as a kid but dont do anymore, before even saying hello. I have sometimes shared the fact that I used to/ might still walk on my toes to some of my friends I have only known as an adult. All of them have never noticed it. The toe walking is the only thing I could see as a symptom of autism but I also now it can be a sign of many other things and it is not like I walk on my toes anymore? My grand parents will also ask my brothers about holidays and social things they do with their friends while what they ask me is weird stuff like how my sleeping schedule is.  I have only shared this with a couple of friends and all some who does not personally know my grandparents. Both of them said that they do not think I have autism and it is not like I have been shoving words down their throat pressured them to claim it, it was all on their intiative. One of them even shared that he as a child had an autism diagnosis as a child which was written off as an adult, which I did not know beforehand. He said that he did notice any signs with me and that he did not believe I was autistic. It felt honest and from his heart. He even said that neurodivergent people (He has ADHD) usually tends to have a ""radar"" that can pinpoint other neurodivergent people so he would properly have noticed any signs. Is this true?  You might be wondering why this is something that is taken up so much space in my brain and maybe even think I am in denial of being autistic. But the reason why it is effecting be so much is because I feel so much misunderstood by my grandparents and I feel like an animal being watched in a zoo. Our latest family gathering was a couple of days ago and when my grand parents talked about autism my grand mother was staring right at me not even hiding it. First I starred right back at her thinking it might make her stop but then I realized she might just think I resonated with having autism so I stopped. My whole nervous system is overworking when they are around and it effects me days after which is why I am writing this. I am stuck with a universal feeling of being disrespected and rage. It feels like they are disabling my authority as an adult person and has captured my sense of identity.  The thing is I am also not sure they will listen if I confront them especially since they are only hinting agressively and not talking open about it. If I starting talking about my low score resualts they would just assume I might secretly think I have it but is in denial.  I broke down a month ago infront of my parents both due to my parents but also due to family problems in general. It was my worst nightmare since my parents often screamed at me or scolded me for crying when I was a child if they did not find the reason for crying rational, even though my psychologist have assured me the reasons were normal for a kid. However my mom talked with me and the talk went okay because I did not mention things my parents have done since that would been she would start gaslighting me. I mentioned my grand parents and she assured me that there was not something medically I did not know about myself and she even said there was some point a test but did not specify when (but I was assume it was when I was evaluated for toe walking). It showed up ""normal"" and the psychiatrist/psychologist some kids are just shy and can easily be taken off by other people taken up too much space without being considerate. My mom even shared that my grandmom has a bipolar disorder and that there had been periods of times before they had kids when my grandmom was not medicated where there had been quite uncomfortable conversations and instances. I also asked my mom about some of my grandparents' comparations with my cousin who has autism, like if I really was sensitive too noise or if I only liked quiet play and games. My mom could verify my memories about not it being a problem. I dont know if you already got picture after I shared some information about my parents but my mom would not be the type to just tell me what I want to hear (more the opposite.  It is both my cousins who are on the spectrum and my mom's theory is that my grandparents' in general feel bad about the lack of communication they are able to have with my cousins. In general they have voiced to my parents' that they are happy that my parents' have kids they can talk to since my other cousins (not only the ones' on the spectrum) all have problems. I secretly also sometimes suspects it is because of my grand parents. My grandmom is also not my biological grandmom and my cousins who have autism are also not someone I am biologically related to (but still feels like family!). Therefore my grandparents can not use a genetic factor as a reason, like I am not genetically predisposed to autism.  Now my mom's solution to all of this is to just ignore it and she does nothing to defend me when these things are happening during the family gatherings. She simply just turn a blind eye. It is my dad's parents and I am therefore not sure if it is a good idea to talk with him about it. I love my dad but he was the other reason I broke down a month ago in front of my parents. He takes up a lot of space and quickly turns defensive and is not really good listener. I also dont want to cause any big family fights or problems.  Now I am so sorry for ranting but I felt like a lot of information was necessary in order for you to understand the whole picture. I am thankfull iif you are even stil reading along.  The bottom line is I have no idea off what to do. Am I overreacting too much? A part of my anxiety is that my worries or things I am anxious about often comes in loops and I struggle to get rid of that one worry or thought once it's started. Everytime I have seen my grandparents the loop starts again and I get self-concious and angry that I can feel it to by bone. It is to the point where it is ruining my day days after and I struggle to concentrate on studying, working and so on.  It is not that I have a problem with autism I simply just do not ressonate with it, it could be about any disorder. I also feel quite hurt about how my grand parents are treating me and observing me like a caged animal and like they think they know me better than I do.  Honestly I could use any advice possible because I am completely lost.

1npbpgi,1758719366,2025-09-24T13:09:26Z,depression,I’m more hopeless than i’ve ever been before,"I’ve been struggling with depression for at least 7 years now, and I’ve learned to kinda deal with it for the most part. I’m only 19, and whenever i would act when i was younger, tell my mom, she always chalked it up to puberty. I would always tell her that isn’t it, and it became increasingly clear that it clearly wasn’t puberty, i’m 19, i’m not going through hormonal spikes or whatever, she’s now chalked it up to me just not liking her. That’s kinda the reason for my hopelessness, I keep fighting with my mom. I’ve tried to fix it so many times, but it’s at this point that I just hate her. I identify as queer and hearing her degrading comments towards the community, how she’ll yell at me for being hurt about said comments, her constant invalidation towards my identity and feelings, it’s become such a burden.    Yesterday she asked if I was mad at her because I seem low and depressed, which you know, makes sense since I am depressed, I told her I was just over everything, but I’m not mad at her. I don’t know if that was taken the wrong way, but she got so upset that she yelled at my sister about how terrible I am, something has to change, I’m so ungrateful, and awful. I’ve been hearing these words about my “attitude problem” and how I’m such a mean spirited by them for my whole life. I don’t have any friends now because I’ve isolated myself and my anxiety has gotten so bad, namely because I think I’m so awful and don’t deserve anything, but I’ve never had this problem with anyone else. I never had drama with friends, I never got into fights, people didn’t think I was mean, I actually had very close friends who honestly fought to keep in touch with me, but along with naturally drifting away because I started doing online school because my anxiety/depression caused me to fail every class, I couldn’t focus, I’d just skip all the time, and my isolation, I have no one now.    Something in me doesn’t believe I’m so terrible, but my breaking point has been my sister. I’ve always felt like I had someone who wouldn’t judge me, who understood, but as time has gone on, and maybe I am  wrong in everything and it’s all in my head, she claimed I always play the victim, everyone needs to walk on eggshells around me. It sounded just like my mom. I know they talk behind my back, but if she’s adopting phrases that my mom always says, it must’ve increased. I don’t feel like I have anyone now. We had a fight a couple of days ago. I had a major migraine, I mean throwing up, my vision is blurry, I can’t drink or eat, I cried and I never cry for pain, nothing worked. I was supposed to be picked up by my mom at a specific time, and I really just wanted to go home because I was suffering so i bad, but instead she picked me up and no one told me about this. She’s a new driver, therefore it took longer, so I was pretty upset when I had to wait an extra 20-40 minutes in that state. I got over it quickly, I didn’t say anything to her, I controlled my emotions, but we went to the store after and she stormed away, stomping through the store, all upset and everything. I didn’t do any of this, my mom didn’t say anything to her. I sighed heavily while clutching my head because I was in so much pain, I was told to cut the attitude out. It’s such a small example, it’s so whiny, but it’s just constant invalidation and double standards.   iWhen we fought the next day over me getting upset because we have a concert soon, it’s been months since I got the tickets, but she never planned around it. I could’ve been more proactive, told her exactly what time we were going even though I swear I did, but she doesn’t remember, I don’t know. I could’ve said it even more, but I got upset at it because I can always immediately tell when someone is mad at me. Even if it’s the slightest bit of annoyance, I can always feel it, and I get really defensive. I started being passive aggressive and said that she doesn’t want to go anyway so it doesn’t matter, which she doesn’t, she’s made that very clear. It’s not a lie, later on she even tells me that she doesn’t want to go at all, which is a huge insecurity of mine because I have such low self esteem that I would never invite anyone to do anything, or even start conversations because I get scared that they don’t even want to do it and I’m a burden. That’s when she says I’m a victim, it’s always my fault, and my mom joins in to say the same thing, tell me I don’t understand the world, she yells at me to move out, they’re both yelling and lecturing me at the same time. I’ve been trying so hard to get a job, I’ve applied to at least 30 places, interviewed several times, but i’ve never had a job before and no one is hiring.    That’s to say it feels like I either move out, or disappear in some way. I don’t even know if I want to die, but I’m running out of time. I told my sister about how I’m suicidal, she told me I need help, I told her I don’t want help, but I do need for her to stop lecturing me about how I need to forgive my mom and be cordial. She continues to lecture me, I tell her to please stop and I’ve been so upset and down because suicidal thoughts have been killing me and I’m just turing to survive, she gets so mad at me for saying this that she storms out of our home. She talked to my mom that day, but not me. Today, she didn’t even say a word to me. It’s like saying without words that it’s my fault for being severely depressed. It was one thing to feel hated by one person in my home, but two is suffocating. I want to act happy and put on a mask, but I can’t. It’s so hard.    I didn’t have to say I don’t want help, but what’s the point? I learn some coping mechanisms, but I’m still stuck here where if I fuck up once, I’ll be told off? And fights with me feel never ending. My sister throws tantrum where she throws things around, she’ll yell, she’ll have this thing where she loudly laughs and it gives me such bad anxiety and terrifies me, I have never said anything about it. My mom will snap on everything then excuse it because she’s been going through something, I don’t say anything.

I had a job that I was unhappy with, loads of constant pressure and my mental health was collapsing. For the past year, I have slept on average 4-5 hours per night. This peaked when in the middle of the summer I got signed off from work for stress, because I was burnt out. In the meantime, I have found a job and accepted it and handed in my resignation. The job has 2 aspects I'm not particularly pleased about but would be more money. Now here's the real kicker: as I am coming to the end of my notice, I am feeling even more anxious and depressed. I am only thinking about the good things there and my brain blocks out the negatives. To add to this, I am also worried about job security in the new role, thinking I won't be able to perform well enough. I am paralyzed by fear about the prospect of being jobless as I have a family to support. I managed to burn out my wife for the stress in the past couple of months. I tried to get my job back but it no longer is there. I am a shell of the person I was before, I have lost interest in most things and don't find any pleasure in anything. I can't even look my family in the eyes because I am so afraid I might fail, and constantly worrying about this being a bad decision.

He’s healthy and we’re going through the ups and downs of first time parents. I sent pictures of my son to my family group chat (mom, dad, sister). Things were going okay but about 2 weeks in, my dad would text things that normal people would say was nonsense and strange things (not in a dangerous way). My sister and mom told me to keep the pictures between just the three of us because dad might send them to his brothers and sister with some nonsense written alongside them. Then it was time for my dad to see my son for the first time. In my mind it was going to be a great moment for the family. But within 10 minutes of picking them up, my dad said something about moving to Germany (he is not based in reality). It was a reminder of my dad’s mental health condition in the midst of a truly wonderful time. Like so many times in my life, it was a reality check.  I don’t have any hatred for my dad. I feel sorry for him. I wish he had a chance to live life without his mental challenges. He’s a good man, and a smart man. He could’ve done a lot of good if his mind allowed him to.  My father has been mentally ill my entire life. I believe he was diagnosed when I was very young. He was on medication but the side effects were too severe for him to continue. That was the first and last time he got professional help.  From what I understand, he isn’t based in reality. I think he hears voices in his head to a small degree. Growing up, I remember he would shake his head left and right and back and forth in something I can only describe as psychotic. He would constantly talk to the TV when watching it. He would write a variety of numbers and geometric shapes on seemingly reams of papers. This is what I always saw coming home from school. He obviously couldn’t hold a job in this state.  On top of this, he’s a hoarder. I remember my mom and dad’s room being full of books. One book stacked on top of another from floor to ceiling with just enough space to walk from bed to door. My mom had enough and threw half the books away and moved the other half to the living room. Definitely not the healthiest thing but it did solve that issue. There were so many, I could sit on them like chairs. There must have been 10 chairs with just half the books. He still hoards little things today. He tries to hide it but it’s clear when you go into his room.  A couple years ago, he was diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately the cancer was one of the slowest growing ones with a high remission rate. I was also engaged at this time. He was scheduled to begin chemo days after my wedding. I decided to miss my honeymoon (overseas to visit my wife’s family). I wanted to be with my dad due to a language barrier and overall support. He refused treatment the day of the first treatment. He said he was waiting to go to Germany for some European treatment. He was maybe a month or two away from dying and it took me screaming at him in a hospital parking lot after a related appointment. I screamed for so long that he caved in and we went to the ER where he was admitted and began chemo as an inpatient.  He made a full recovery. In a way that frustrated me even more. All he had to do was begin treatment. However, I remind myself how scary it must have been for him and try to be as understanding as possible.  Thanks. Reality just hit me these last few weeks. I’m not angry. But it is a shame it has to be this way.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npd28o/the_joy_of_my_newborn_and_the_reality_of_my_dads/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npd28o/the_joy_of_my_newborn_and_the_reality_of_my_dads/

1npdo50,1758724208,2025-09-24T14:30:08Z,depression,"My twenties were not my best years, suicidal and paranoid.","I suffered so much crap in my 20's and I sit and listen to people say ""they are the best years of your life"". And I cannot help but think it's just utter Bullshit! During my childhood I grew up poor in a single parent household, with recurring episodes of fatherly abuse. I was pretty much written off by people during my teens, as depression kicked in, education suffered and I had few prospects. Even within the circle of my extended family, I felt this. Because I drank, smoked, smoked weed, did some drugs and listened to alternative music (to escape my reality). My extended family considered me a bad influence to others, even though I strongly discouraged my cousins from doing what I did. I was the black sheep for sure,  I was never abusive or rude towards anyone, or got in trouble with the police. I was introverted, socially awkward (later diagnosed as autistic) and basically all round shy.    I had a child when I was 18 in my first relationship, with someone who was just awful. During our relationship she was (repeatedly) emotionally, verbally and physically absuive. At a time where abuse towards male partners was mostly under/unreported and looked upon with suspicion from society. When we broke up she became even worse, using our child as a constant power play. She spread malicious rumours about me, within our local community. And I faced judgement from people who I had known for years, without them even asking me if the rumours possessed any truth. Her family were known in our area for being violent (towards others and if not, towards themselves), drunk and always on the wrong side of the law. My ex made my life a living hell for the next 16 years, but for the good of my child I always stuck around. Suffering every indignity you could imagine from the hands of that woman. I was the only person in my social group who had a child young. And no-one I met (romantically) during my younger years (20's) was interested in someone who had a kid. I ended up getting used and ghosted a few times by women, and unfortunately I ended up in another relationship with a woman. Who was mentally, financially and physically abusive too.  My mental health was horrifically bad, I was medicated and under therapy during my 20's. But, nothing got me out of the groove I was in! From what I stated above, I isolated myself, and withdrew from friends and family. I pretty much avoided people on the whole, staying in alot, alone,  just watching films. I always wanted a healthy relationship, and to be socialable but I was probably too mentally ill and suicidal for it to happen. And I found myself with women who were just on the rebound. I was an attractive person, female attention was never a problem. But sex was always ""the only"" thing on offer from them. After a while I gave up and just used sex as a means to feel something, anything. I ended up getting addicted to it as a form of escapism, but it never worked. On the few occasions I would socialise, in the few friendship groups I had remaining, I was considered a bit of a joke. A loser with no prospects, who just slept around alot. This is the story of my twenties, I was suicidal and depressed, extremely paranoid. And constantly changing medication, disagnosis, therapy.   Things are much better now I'm in my 40s and I'm free of my ex, my daughter has flown the nest. I married in my mid 30s and I have 2 wonderful small children. I worked my way through university twice, and I have a excellent career with good prospects. My mental health has been stable for a while now. But even so, when looking through my partners old family photo albums. I see how good her life was during the same period my life was just awful. There's very few photos of me during my 20s, I dont have any adventures of exploring the world. I have no memories of making new friends, life was just hell. I eventually got out of the continuing cycle of depression that plagued me during my twenties. And I am in a headspace where self-harm or suicidal ideation is not a factor in my life at all. But part or me thinks I was robbed of the best years of my youth. In a life that I'll only experience one, in a youth I'll ever have once.   I really do wish, that if you are suffering with depression, or are suicidal in your youth as I was. That you manage to get the help you deserve for you not to experience what I have.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1npdo50/my_twenties_were_not_my_best_years_suicidal_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1npdo50/my_twenties_were_not_my_best_years_suicidal_and/

I remember not caring that much when my dad was hospitalized for cancer. When he passed away, I cried a bit and moved on just like that.  Now, I'm a 14 and almost every day I remember everything everyone once did to piss me off and I would plan out an entirely possible way to get back at them. Even to my mom and my best friend of seven years.  At school, I stole pens every time I have the chance for shits and giggles. I don't even use the pens, I just do it to entertain myself as the owner crashes out after losing a pen for the third time that week. Honestly, I feel no desire to return anything I stole and I feel no remorse.  I know being bad is the opposite of cool and powerful but I still feel in control when I brag about skipping school or stealing to my close friends. I like being bad and I like it when others speak of my bad behavior (insults are another thing, though).

1npetw0,1758726848,2025-09-24T15:14:08Z,offmychest,I don’t know anymore…,"I think I’m having a early life crisis?   I’m suprised if anyone reads this, and if you do I’m so sorry I just sit and ramble.   Here’s some context on my situation;  I’m a 23yo stay-at-home mother (5yo daughter & 2yo son).  I’ve been out of the working field for about 4 years now (except for a couple months which I’ll explain more).  I never got to graduate because of childhood issues, & then when I got back into school I fell pregnant with my first and had to drop out again because I would’ve been put out of grandmother’s house so I had to move over an hour away to my children’s father’s family’s house.  I have a semi decent relationship with their father (We’ve had issues in the past that we’ve worked through and now we’re at a neutral point in time. We do everything as a regular relationship would, except we don’t say ‘I love you’ & I honestly don’t see us getting married).  I have a shitty relationship with my toxic family, that entails me being everyone’s beck and call when someone goes off the deep end or needs help (ie; addiction, mental health, needing support, needing help raising children, etc) but when I’m seeking guidance or support every once in a while I’m getting shot down and scolded about how I ‘catastrophize everything’. I don’t have any friends.  We haven’t had the best luck with financials, housing situations, cars, etc.  I was diagnosed with bipolar, major depression disorder, anxiety, & I have a very severe dissociation/depersonalization disorder.  Overall, everything has just kind of sucked throughout my childhood & the last 5 years of adulthood.   I’ve done A LOT of work on myself. I’m no where near what I want to be for myself and my kids, but I’ve made a lot of progress from when I was a child/teenager.  I’ve always tried to maintain gratitude and forgiveness. I understand that my relationship isn’t perfect but I forgive him for his mistakes because he’s a human and I’m grateful that he’s made progress. I understand my mother or father or grandmother were hurt in their young years and they process their feelings differently than I do. They’ve made mistakes and I forgive them and I’m just grateful they’re alive. The housing situations we’ve been in aren’t the best conditions but I grew up homeless and I’m just grateful that I have a roof over our heads. Same situation with cars.  Regardless of how rough things have been, I just want to constantly be grateful and forgiving of what I do have because I really could have nothing, and I’m terrified to want better because what if I’m not grateful enough and then things could totally take a turn for the worse. I’m getting side tracked.   I’ve tried anything I could to get better mentally. Medications, therapies, diet changes, exercise habits, journaling, hobbies, working, etc. I don’t know how else to change my life so I can become a better person besides completely changing everything I’ve ever known.  The only goals I’ve ever had in life were being a good mom and owning my own house.  I don’t know if it’s the mental health or the age speaking, but I have completely lost myself and I don’t think that’s my goal anymore, I think that was my trauma speaking and being scared to repeat what I went through as a child.  Now before anyone gasps, I still obviously want to be a good mom, my kids are my universe. I think I’m just learning that I’m allowed to have my kids be my purpose and other things be my purpose at the same time. My biggest fear is turning out to be some angry, insecure, emotionally unstable mother who’s kids grow up to hate her and never gets to live a life.   I think my only resolution left is starting over by myself. My own place, my own job/career, finishing my ged, going to college, my own new friend group, being able to actually take care of myself. Especially without the stress and fear of the people around me making me feel guilty for wanting to take care of myself. For whatever reason it makes them mad when I talk about something that I think would help myself.  But I think I wont be able to get better without cutting ties with my partner or family.  I think I should also mention I’m not abandoning my children of course. We would just alternate weeks, one week I have them, one week he would.   How do I go about any of this without feeling like a horrible person? None of them have been very great to me but I feel this immense amount of guilt for cutting ties with anyone. But at the same time, my children are the most important thing in this world to me and I’m scared if I don’t I’m going to fuck them up.  At this point, I’m scared if I don’t make some changes, it will be the end of me.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npetw0/i_dont_know_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npetw0/i_dont_know_anymore/

I try my best to remember but it’s a habit and it makes so much more sense to me to do that and then load the dishwasher all at once. It’s just that I’m never given any grace on this. It’s always just everyone being upset with me about dishes in the sink, when to me it is objectively a correct place for them to be. It’s not like I’m leaving shit out on the counters and wherever I feel like it, which is more or less how I did things before we moved into this place.  It’s just so frustrating and disheartening that I’m trying to do my best, and trying to compromise by at least putting things in the sink instead of leaving them around. And I do put things in the dishwasher. It’s not that I never do it and there’s always stuff in the sink, because there isn’t. I leave a few things at a time and then put them in the dishwasher at one time. But it’s not good enough. Seemingly, nothing I do is ever good enough, despite my efforts.   This isn’t the only thing we disagree on, but it’s the thing that comes up the most, and the thing that is currently on my mind.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npg71z/everything_that_works_for_me_is_a_problem_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npg71z/everything_that_works_for_me_is_a_problem_for/
1npgo3w,1758730981,2025-09-24T16:23:01Z,offmychest,I changed for the worse after therapy and I cannot get my old self back,"Hello everyone, been here in this sub and other subs before, around 8- ish months ago and a lot of people told me to go to therapy which I was planning to do anyways. My problem is kind of stupid, which is I cosplay and met friends through this hobby. All mine and my friends works are purely SFW but I felt shame and kept hiding the fact and asking people not to post pics. My friend recently went public though. I am graduating from an engineering phd program in the most prestigious university in my region with some awards in flagship conferences beating multiple countries in competitions and such.  I come from a small country literally the middle of nowhere with conservative views from most people. My parents exhibited a lot of shock when they first knew about my hobby and made me feel ashamed that this is what entertains the “ prestigious me”. I vented to non hobby friends and while some showed opposition they didn’t alienate me or cut me off , aka they didn’t think of me as a black mark to their social circle. But I went into therapy to solve my intense shame feelings probably stemming from the need to achieve from childhood.  While the therapist told me it is not shameful she said due to my work I have to pick less exposure approach , and gave an example that she as a therapist cannot post grwm videos for example , despite the account being under a pseudonym and not relating to my professional life in any form.  That left a bad taste in my mouth and I started being scared and anxious all the time . Like I am being watched.  I have an outing with my friend who went public in the weekend but I feel super bad to say this but I am now ashamed to get out with her based on the therapist words .   I wasn’t like that before and I have hung out with people of many backgrounds in the past but now if I am always afraid that : - my non hobby people and work will cut me off if more ppl find out - someone will see me with my hobby circle and I’d be alienated by them.   Whoever I am with I feel so much fear and anxiety. I want my old self back . Before my parents found out. I even had a time when I posted some stuff on twitter and I was fine. This was a recent thing that I have been dealing with eventhough I have cosplayed occasionally  before and none of this happened.    I don’t know if it is because I am so close to graduation and will no longer be just a student . And I have to be seen with more authority or were my parents the trigger.  I just want my old happy creative self back.

About a month ago I went speed dating and met a guy and we really hit it off. We talked every day since then and we went out on three dates. The first date we went to dinner and drive around, second date I went over his place we cooked dinner, I met his dog and roommate and we spent the whole day together. Third date was last night. I just moved to a new city and don’t have many friends. He said he takes birthdays seriously and wants to take me out to an Italian restaurant to celebrate. We go to the restaurant and I’m ecstatic. I’ve never been taken out to a place like this and I can’t stop smiling. After we finish eating we go to a cvs get candy and sit at a park bench nearby to eat and talk. We were probably sitting there talking for about 3 hours. We’re cuddling the whole time he has his arm around me and I can’t stop staring at him and kissing him. We’re also sharing deep topics about issues we’ve had with our families. I’m not super close with mine and didn’t hear from them on my birthday so I was just so happy to be with him. All of the sudden with his arm still around me he says he has something to talk about. He tells me that he’s been seeing other people and he assumes I have been too (I havent) and he tells me that a couple months before he went speed dating he met a girl on Reddit ironically and she wants to be exclusive and he wants to be too. He says maybe if we met at a different time we would have been together. He also says I deserve someone who wouldn’t hesitate about me. This whole time his arm is still around mine and I’m shaking from the shock. He says “you’re shaking” and holds my hand and I tell him to leave. He leaves and I’m sitting on the bench shaking and crying and can barely walk to the train station. I spent the whole night crying and woke up crying and feel lightheaded at work. It was the first time I felt potential for a relationship and years and it was the best I’ve ever been treated. And it was so sudden I can’t believe it’s just over like that and I’ll never see him again. I’m tired of never being good enough for anyone and I can’t help but think what did she have that  I I didn’t and what did I do wrong. I truly just feel like I’m going to fall apart. I scheduled an extra therapy session and I scheduled a date from a dating app and found a different speed dating event I signed up for but I feel like I’m going to regret it and I’m still too heartbroken. I wish I hadn’t gotten so attached and saw potential where there wasn’t. I also spent my birthday alone my parents didn’t even say anything and this was supposed to be the thing that would make it all better. I just haven’t felt so alone like this in so long and I’m tired of crying I just wish I didn’t meet him.",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nphb3w/just_really_heartbroken/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nphb3w/just_really_heartbroken/

When I try to encourage myself with things like “you can do it” or “believe in yourself,” a single, humorless, mocking thought reliably shows up. It’s not a brief doubt — it’s steady, felt in my throat and chest, and it’s been honed over years. It feels like a deeply trained automatic reaction: a voice that instantly undermines any attempt to self-affirm by treating those affirmations as obvious lies.  I want two kinds of replies:  1. Scientific/psychological explanations: what brain systems and learning mechanisms could produce an inner voice that’s so automatic and embodied? How would things like amygdala reactivity, PFC regulation, prediction error/reconsolidation, attentional bias, or learned helplessness explain this pattern?   2. Real human evidence & practical experiments: if you had a similar inner critic, what small, repeatable experiments actually created the evidence you needed to weaken it? Concrete steps, brief dosing (how often), and what actually changed in your thinking or body sensations.    Context that may help but you don’t need to read it: This critic isn’t a fleeting thought; it feels like a principled, mocking response and shows up reliably when I try to motivate myself. I want answers grounded in neuroscience/CBT/learning theory and human-tested practical tips — not cheerleading.  What I’ll do with replies: I’m collecting mechanisms and small experiments I can run daily to generate real, scientific-style evidence for myself. If you can, please include brief statements like: “I did X for Y days and got Z result.”  TLDR: A persistent, humorless inner critic blocks self-affirmation.

1nphz3u,1758733937,2025-09-24T17:12:17Z,offmychest,My brother tried to kill himself last week.,"Some context for the situation: My brother and I are only 6 years apart, but he considers me to be his mom. We don't have parents that are really in the picture at this time.  Three weeks ago, my brother texted me and asked me to help him move out of and get away from an abusive relationship. My husband and I immediately moved him into our spare room, got his stuffed moved out, and everything seemed to be going well. He found a room he was going to start renting that seemed like a great situation, he was applying to jobs closer to it and was getting responses.  Last Monday my husband and I both took NyQuil to fight the cold we were dealing with and said good night to my brother. We got woken up at 5:30 by calls from my brother's ex. Apparently around 1:30 he decided to leave our house, take an entire bottle of his pills, and went to see ex for closure before he planned to die. Ex got him on an ambulance and woke us up asap.  Tuesday through Thursday was spent in the hospital at his side. I slept in my car or in the bed next to him. I held his hand and sat there while we waited to see if anything he took would have a lasting effect on him going forward. But he was alive and I held it together for him. He has been in inpatient since Saturday. He comes home to us tomorrow. I am grateful that I'll know where he is but my anxiety levels are very very high. How will I sleep knowing he can slip out of the house in the middle of the night again? How do I go to work knowing he has access to a car, and kitchen knives, and knowing he will be by himself? I feel so guilty for feeling like this but I wish the responsibility of him and what's to come could go to someone else. I didn't ask to be a mom and to be his main emotional support. I will do it and do everything I can for him because I love him, don't get me wrong.

1npi4ua,1758734302,2025-09-24T17:18:22Z,offmychest,I’m glad my friend is no longer working with me,"I work at a fast food place and I don’t have many friends as I just moved here. So when I started this job and recognized the anime stickers on his water bottle, I got excited and immediately pointed them out. We became fast friends after that, talking about anime so much that we got distracted often. I have his number and we text often as well.  There’s one problem though, he is very rude to customers. Every time I’m working with him at the front-of-house my anxiety goes through the roof because he’s one step away from a confrontation every single day I work with him.  He has an exaggerated dry/annoyed voice when speaking to customers. He sighs anytime they say something that annoys him. One of the more annoying things he does is cut off the customer when they say a menu item but not the full government fucking name. For example:  “I’ll get the chocolate lava ca-“ “You mean the Double Chocolate Lava Explosion Cake Deluxe?”  All with an annoyed voice. Sometimes he even gets real nasty and leans over and starts insulting the customer’s appearance.  He finally got the confrontation he was (SEEMINGLY!) begging for recently. A customer came in and asked to use the bathroom and I’ll be honest, I just say yes even though our policy is to not let anyone in unless they’re paying. I almost always get yelled at when I repeat the policy to customers and again I hate confrontation. My friend came out from the back and asked where the customer went because he heard the door ring. I regretfully inform him what I did and he puffs his chest and tells me he’s gonna tell him when he comes out.   The customer comes out and he’s immediately on him, being unnecessarily short with the customer. The customer explains that he’s been here before and he completely understands. Being VERY understanding. Then my coworker says something to the effect of “Alright now go,” while shooing him away. As the customer would soon point out, much like a dog.  The customer EXPLODES. Asks him who he’s talking to, threatens to get him fired, all of your usual angry customer spiel. Two other customers came in during it, it was a whole mess. I had to try and take their order and ignore all the yelling.   You’re probably wondering what my coworker is doing and saying during all this. This is where I inform you of his other quirk. The minute the customer throws his energy back at him, he back peddles. He starts talking to the customer like they’re crazy or just misunderstood him. He’s telling the customer that he told him “you can go now” which is a lie. Everything eventually calms down and the customer even apologizes and I believe my coworker did too, but he made me take his order (the customer changed his mind and wanted something). He retreated to the back and insisted he “didn’t want to be out there with him”.  That’s what he does. He seems to ALSO be afraid of confrontation which baffles me. Anyway, I feel bad because I never tell him the truth. I just sympathize with him because I’m bad at telling people their faults. He just had his last day as he got hired at another job and I just hope his new manager there tells him instead.

I'm (21M) really confused in this period of my life. I'm currently doing studies that I midly enjoy, its only recently that I discovered in which field I want to really specialize to hopefully find a job or internship soon. My family and friends are really supporting me, eventhough I failed my first year in higher education, which was in another field. After that really disastrous first year, they supported me in changing into another academic subject.   I know deep down that my current subject is not the easiest to deal with professionally. My teachers keep telling me that the market is saturated, which doesn't encourage me. I even started taking additional classes in another subject in hopes of diversifying my academic record.  On the other hand, my twin brother is thriving. He has had a much more impressive career path and experiences, since he entered a prestigious university and then went on to do relatively well-paid internships (he is still doing them and will soon graduate). I admire him so much, but at the same time I am jealous. It's the same with my closest friends ; some of them are pursuing very impressive studies, while others have started small businesses that are doing well. I try to put myself in their shoes, and every time, I tell myself that I don't have what it takes.   I am aware that I also have qualities that are unique to me, of course, but I feel that compared to them, they are absolutely worthless. I am shy and reserved, and despite my attempts, I am also very much a homebody. I have not been diagnosed with social anxiety, but I feel like I have it. I can't seem to gain weight.  My brother recently invited me to a party to celebrate his girlfriend's birthday. She is very nice, I like her a lot. Everything was going very well, I was happy to talk and meet his friends. They were chill and good-vibes. But as usual, when they start talking about their journeys, I feel like a piece of shit. And I noticed that this wasn't the first time ; when family invites us over for dinner, when our studies or personal lives are mentioned, I get a lump in my throat, because I don't really have something to say.  To be clear, I don't hate anyone around me. I'm happy for them; they deserve their success. My father is my greatest inspiration. I particularly admire his calmness and intelligence. I feel unworthy of them. Why can't I be like them ? Why can't I have their confidence ?   What I want is stability, to be able to offer my loved ones what they offer me every day. I don't know what they really think of me, but I'm afraid they see me as a parasite. I feel like I've made the worst choices. I feel like I'm the failed child.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npiaei/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npiaei/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others/

1npis80,1758735804,2025-09-24T17:43:24Z,mentalhealth,Venting and drained TLDR!!!!,"Hi everyone,   I honestly don’t know where to start. This is about mental health, and I struggle to put it into words, but I’ll try.  I’m 17, in my senior year. I feel like I have a happy soul—I kind of know I do. When I was a few years old, a doctor told my mom that I was a happy kid, and I feel like that’s true.  But lately… I just don’t feel happy. I’m often numb, sad, or distracted from negative emotions. What makes it confusing is that I feel like I have the soul of a child. I love playing with kids, their innocence, and the way they can just be. I laugh at kid-like jokes, mess around like them, but still… this numbness and sadness remain.  I tend to be numb and non-emotionally expressive. Whenever something bad happens, I usually just go numb. Lately, I feel completely drained and like I’ve lost every ounce of will to live. I struggle with my emotions, my mindset, my thoughts, and even my sense of identity and personality. It’s like I don’t even know who I am anymore.  I often feel inferior, like I’m weak. Maybe it comes from over-dependence on my mom when I was younger. One recent example really highlights this enmeshment: when I was 16, I liked an actor and genuinely admired him. But as soon as my mom said she personally disliked him, I found myself suddenly hating the actor too—almost immediately. It was subconscious, but it shows how easily my opinions and feelings were shaped by her. Experiences like this, along with other forms of subtle enmeshment, made me feel like I don’t fully have my own mind or identity.  My dad and I aren’t very close, and that really affected me. It left me feeling empty, like I don’t have a proper sense of identity or personality. I feel like I missed out on the father-son bond every boy should have, and that absence still weighs heavily on me.  My mom was very strict academically. I remember in 8th grade, I got 2nd place, and I was so scared of her reaction that I started crying while trying to explain myself. I told her that I used to wake up at 3 a.m., walking back and forth in the hallway, calculating my marks, and stressing over my grades. But she said, “Yeah, you will be stressed because you didn’t study well,” and I was like, how could she say that while I was telling her that a 13-year-old wakes up at night, stressing and walking back and forth from stress? How? What makes me feel conflicted is that she can be sympathetic sometimes, but at that time she wasn’t—it was weird. She didn’t talk to me for days and took my phone until I regained first place.  I also feel like my parents didn’t let me explore myself fully. I was interested in tech, video games, robotics—but I wasn’t allowed to play games except during summer vacation. My mom often compared me to others and played the victim card, which made me feel like I don’t have my own identity. I wasn’t abused, but these things left me feeling confused, lost, inferior, and depressed.  Other things about me:  * I’m extremely stressful and restless. * I feel demoralized because it seems like everyone has hobbies except me, and they have the chance to live their childhood the way I wanted. Seeing that makes me feel bad so much, even though I feel like I had a good childhood—it’s hard to explain. * I’m consciously misanthropic in an extreme, unhealthy way. Maybe it’s a self-defense mechanism from pressure, stress, and instability, especially the la",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npis80/venting_and_drained_tldr/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npis80/venting_and_drained_tldr/

I feel as if I am constantly on the edge and can never genuinely relax. I have intrusive thoughts all the time and try to imagine myself in scenarios and see how to fix it etc. It feels like a weird form of perfectionism by being pessimistic so that I am immune to almost all problems since I expected it all along.  I expect the worst of people. If someone says something offending, I try to deduce the logical reason as to why or if someone or something unknown approaches me when I don't see it like my back, I have a sudden jerk and a heartbeat. Not to mention, whether it's an assignment or going to home, I always try it to finish it as fast as possible even though it's not necessary.  For example, I insist on leaving as early as possible to my home even though the ten minutes saved in traffic basically means nothing since I have nothing to do in home either. It's as if there is constant anxiety (I have OCPD self-diagnosed)  I feel very tired. That's fine if things were objective bad in life but at least this week, my life is pretty good.

I’ve considered a masters in social work as it’s broader and probably become a therapist. But idk. Im more creative and artistic person and so considered career as a tattoo artist, model, social media content influencer or something beauty industry but scared to pursue it as I feel it wouldn’t make much.

It's been a few days since I moved into the apartment I'm renting and sharing with 2 other strangers and I'm just feeling so out of place. College or any responsibilities haven't even started yet I'm already feeling like I wanna go back. In an unfamiliar place, with unfamiliar people and while having no ideat about anything.   And through all that the realization that, fuck, I'm considered an adult now feels even weirder. Because I just don't feel like it at all, I don't know anything and I don't feel any different than from teenager me or kid me (even though Im still a teen, 19, but you get what Im saying)       I don't see that much different from a 15 year old me than a current 19 year old me aside from being a little more mature and having a drivers license but suddenly I'm seen as an adult?  I just don't feel ready, I just wanna go back 5 or 10 years to where my biggest worry was getting a good grade on a test and my average day was comprised of studying, doing chores and then playing videogames and drinking tea with too much sugar till noon as immature as it is. It was monotone and simple but I liked it.  Technically it really isn't that much different here but simply being labeled as an adult and being taken out of that monotony is scary. Now 5 times a week I wake up in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people around and I wish I could go home. But I am home, this is my life and I'm so lost.

I've been working for Customer Support for the past 2 years. Recently, I was promoted into a QA position. Our team leadership is dividend into:  Supervisor (generally oversees the agents, organizational stuff)  QA (evaluates tickets done by the agents, helps them when needed. Makes sure stuff is done correctly)  Trainer (trains the new hires over the course of 2 weeks, helps them onboard).  This is a fresh new project we're supposed to be working on. Great opportunity to prove yourself and set some standards right? Fucking wrong. Its a shitshow.  Our trainer has been on sick leave for 5 weeks by now. So me and the supervisor had to pick up her slack and train the very first batoh of agents. Teach them about stuff we have learned literally a week ago ourselves. Okay.  The client (that i will not name) shows a complete lack of transparency and communication. Our workflows are not available. We dont have access to necessary tools. They're not able to provide any kind of deadlines.  You'd think the first days in production for the agents would be easy and calm, right? Wrong. They showed us a backlog of literally hundreds of e-mails and told us to clear them ASAP. With less than 10 agents on their literal first day on the job. And the topics of the e-mails are stuff that was only briefly mentioned once during the training. The stuff we actually trained for, we are not doing.  Naturally, the agents are frustrated the same as me, and are considering quitting.  I get off work in the evening and still think about the next day. How to salvage all this. We simply dont have the capacity to clear that fucking queue.  I signed up to be a fucking QA, but instead im acting as trainer and supervisor. I didnt sign up to be a leader, although I try to do my best. But how can I keep the morale of the agents up, when I am as frustrated as them, and know the exact same jackshit they do? The client doesnt tell us anything neither.  If you read this far, thank you. I just needed to vent very badly.

For the last year I feel like I've been slowly losing myself to depression. Crazy things went on in my life and now i finally get to rest for a bit. But with rest comes the tension drop, and combined with the still existing issue in my life, i feel like I'm losing this battle.  I want out, i want to thrive, but the motivation and inspiration I always used to have is mostly gone. I know I tend to oriente myself around other's  needs, and now being freshly single and away from most of my friends ia really hard on my mental health.  Even dating has been hard, because I'm much more specific in what I'm looking for. And i find that even feeling the other person's pain when i reject them is too hard on me.  So today i decided to start a habit of exercising for at least 20 min every day. A whatever video i can find on YouTube,  nothing fancy. Just to move myself even when there's no external motivation (like a scheduled practice at a studio).  I know i should be maintaining a tighter sleep schedule (hooray dating a bipolar years ago and remembering his routine), at about midnight for about 8-9 hours.  Nutritional consultation will come eventualy.   But I'll love to hear some small habits of Dos and Don't  that get you by...

Ive been through constant therapy for years and it never changes the disgusting and awkward feeling i get when i try and imagine a relationship with somebody im attracted to.

Its not like i enjoy being hammered to the point where the room is spinning and my sole focus is not throwing up, but i guess i just enjoy feeling something other than disgust, anxiety or sadness. Every relationship ive ever been has crumbled and burnt because i was never able to talk about my past trauma of being raped and it turned into prolonged periods of me being horribe and distant, because i have this horrible fear that i am once again being used by someone who just wants me for what i have to offer them. A girl i dated for about 3 months accused me of assaulting her, due to the fact i split up with her because she tried to control the way i looked, the clothes i wore and the way i acted (probably one of the only times ive ever stuck up for myself). The pain of wondering if ill ever be loved turned to me burning and slashing myself, and i attempted to hang myself before my best friend found me and i was pushed through more goddamn therapy which dug up more trauma. When i was fifteen and i finally told my therapist i was raped, she passed it to the police and i had rk give a detailed account to the officer in front of my mentally abusive mother, who saw it as a sign of weakness within me.

1npl6sz,1758741252,2025-09-24T19:14:12Z,offmychest,News I wasn't prepared for.,"I was in a really bad car wreck about 3 years ago... I've been in almost constant pain since. I didn't get much money only $30k in my pocket for a replacement car, lost wages and paying back my family. (I was definitely screwed over by a law firm looking for a quick payday.)   Yesterday I got news that my back will always be an issue and I will always be in pain, my disks are eating my vertebrae and the issues will continue to deteriorate my quality of life. There are some procedures available, but unfortunately not 100% a fix, and they are temporary. I'm so exhausted by it all. I used to hike, run around with my kids and work out. Now I can hardly go down the stairs without tripping or extreme pain. I gained 70lbs due to the injury and a late diagnosis of hypothyroidism. I'm miserable all the way around.   I was raised to pull myself up by the boot straps and keep marching. Honestly I don't have it in me anymore. I miss hiking in the mountains and being an active person, I miss my mobility and ability to work out. I've got nothing now. Just extreme pain and discomfort. I feel like I'm dragging those around me down like a burdening anchor. People say ""Therapy helps with this and that."" Therapy doesn't help shit. I am a burden, I am a waste of space, resources and add very little value to the world. Is it bleak? Yes, but sometimes the truth hurts a lot.   My back is so bad the Dr didn't even mention my weight. Do you know how bad ones spine has to be for them to not blame weight???? I'll tell you... Pretty fucking bad. My vertebrae are bright white in the middle with jagged edges and disk material bulging out into my spinal cord. (MRI and X-ray) I keep trying to have a ""can do"" attitude and I just can't anymore. I don't want pain pills or muscle relaxers. I hate the way pain pills make me feel, I feel gross and sluggish. I just want my life back, I want to be able to hike again... I want to adventure again... I don't want people to just assume I'm a fat, lazy slug. I've never been one to sit for very long and now I'm stuck sitting here wishing. I want to enjoy life again so badly...",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npl6sz/news_i_wasnt_prepared_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npl6sz/news_i_wasnt_prepared_for/

i'm not cruel to myself, i'm a realist. there's no progress. i mean, in terms of personal development. zero. does a person never change, never make progress, never get out of their comfort zone? since the quarantine, i've been the same person, even more unhealthy. there are only 2 or 3 months left until 2026. supposedly 2025 was going to be my year. i was going to lose weight, i was going to be healthy. i'm still 130 kilos, in fact i think i've even passed 130. i haven't weighed myself. i haven't weighed myself in months. because i'm so scared to weigh myself. anyway. and then there's cardiophobia, which is terrible. i constantly try to listen to my heart, i can't forget that it's there. i'm worried that my heart will give up one day because i'm unhealthy, irregular, and eat excessively. i already have a lot of problems. cholesterol, sugar (i don't have sugar but i have low resistance, i could get it at any moment) fatty liver, excess weight, a single kidney... all of these have been in me for 23 years. and there's no change, there's nothing i've done for myself. my sleep isn't regular, in fact i've never felt like i've sunk this low. i literally live like a vampire and i'm not happy about this situation at all. my health anxieties are increasing. cancer always comes to my mind. the reason i'm so afraid of cancer is because i lost the person i love most to cancer, and my dad overcame cancer. they were very difficult processes for me. my dad got cancer. i went back to the beginning. i skipped school, i was held back a grade. thank goodness he overcame cancer but it was a very difficult process for me, for us. and now i'm afraid for myself and for my family. i'm afraid that one day if i get it, my whole life will turn upside down. i think to myself, so many healthy people get this cancer, why wouldn't i get it? i know it's a very unhealthy thought but i'm not very healthy either. i'm not beautiful because a 130 kilo obese person can never be expected to look beautiful. when i look in the mirror, i don't see myself, i see a walking blob of fat. no, i'm not being cruel to myself. what i see is real. half of my body is fat. i'm not doing anything to take my life into my own hands. i'm aware of everything but i'm not taking a step. everything remains in words. i can't live a whole different life from scratch all at once but i've also realized that taking small steps doesn't work for me anymore. i scare myself with the realities i've created in my head. you're going to have a heart attack, you're going to get cancer, you're already unhealthy, you're inactive, you ate too much today, you couldn't control yourself, you fell asleep again, you woke up at noon again, you gave in to your desires again, you didn't go outside again, your chest hurts again, they're coming for you again, you're going to have a panic attack again, this is going to happen again, that's going to happen again. i literally never got out of my comfort zone. i never socialized, i never participated in different activities. and i feel like i'm getting burnout syndrome... i'm collapsing more and more. i'm getting ruined more and more. i am not this. i am not the person i see when i look in the mirror, and i haven't been for 23 years. my body has never been at the weight it should be, so i never knew what i truly looked like. i was always fat. always. i was born overweight even as a baby. sometimes i think it's too late for everything. people my age are doing so many things... and all i'm doing is looking 40 years old. i repeat, i'm not being cruel to myself, i'm being honest. my swinging arms, my sagging breasts, my huge cheeks, my sagging chin, my huge belly and my body. this is not me. i shouldn't be. i don't know what kind of person is inside of me, what i normally look like. i don't know. my only problem isn't eating either. a life without a routine, laziness, getting used to comfort, not being able to leave the comfort zone, losing yourself, not having control over myself, lack of willpower... a person can't live like this. i don't do anything, i don't create, i don't travel, i don't take care of myself. i sit. i sit all day long. that's the only thing i do. and then i cry that i'm going to get cancer, i'm going to have a heart attack, i'm going to die. but nothing changes. i don't know what i'm waiting for to happen. i don't know",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nplonc/this_has_turned_into_a_long_post_im_sorry_i_feel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nplonc/this_has_turned_into_a_long_post_im_sorry_i_feel/

While I don’t agree with all her statements and feelings, I have respect and an understanding of the things she went through. There are some sentiments that I do agree with and would validate if I had the opportunity to. However, after I expressed I didn’t want to be in the middle, she also went NC with me but still sends me a happy birthday card or text yearly.   I just got engaged this weekend. He was the first guy I dated that she approved of. While I couldn’t be happier, I do think of her and would like to share the news.

She ended up responding back with that she was busy that day. Even though I suggested sometime later, she said that she might have time then. Either way, I'm interpreting this as no. This coupled with people in my friend group finding others so easily started to eat at me and make me depressed. I definitely did NOT cry that night.  Either way, it was the next day and I chose to wear a bigfoot shirt. It was just a shirt that I had that could pair with my shorts and shoes. Either way, after class, I was talking to a friend about some tough stuff when a random guy complimented my shirt. When I said ""thanks"" he whooped really loudly. All of a sudden, it was like a switch was flipped in my brain. I was catapulted even lower into my depression. The moment my other class was done, I went back and changed my shirt, angrily throwing the bigfoot one into my hamper.  I don't know why it ate at me and why it is still eating at me. I think it's just that his physical appearance (short, fat, and with a slight neckbeard) made me brand him as a loser. I work out aggressively, with weightlifting until my body is burning in pain, swimming until my abs feel like they are going to just shut off, and running until I struggle to walk. I think that because I got rejected even though I have done all of this work on my body and on my mind (usually talking to girls I'm interested in gives me horrible anxiety and I don't do it) and then the only attention I got was from this random loser (I'm sorry, but it's the only way my mind sees him) makes me feel like a huge failure.  But I think it also stems from my friends being able to find people so easily because they chose the good clubs. I chose one that while it can help me education-wise and with professional networking, it has pretty much fucked me over for any chance of social interaction. I used to hang around weirdos like that in high school, and I think that realizing I squandered an opportunity (I could have joined this great club but stupidly rejected) and only attracting the attention of someone like that guy will put me right back into that awful depressing isolation of high school.

1npmg0k,1758744182,2025-09-24T20:03:02Z,depression,I want a do over,"**TW:** Homophobia, mild mention of nsfw   I apologize beforehand if this post is like really long, I know it will be. Thank you for making some space here for me.  Female, Latina, femme lesbian, small shop artist, 23 going on 24 this October, undiagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  It's hard to even know where to start because there's so many factors that I toughed through but at this point they've become awful and unshakable. I'm paranoid I'm just lazy or burnout is just me being indecisive, but I want so badly for some of the shitty parts of my life to be...not my fault. And it's so frustrating because up to high school and even sophomore year of college, I felt like I could do things.  **My Parents:**  My family is Latino and Catholic, *great* environment to grow up in being gay(/sar). Both are the, give it to God/be strong type of people. That's their comfort or my mother sarcastically pats my head when I ask for affection. But every year I feel softer, more sensitive and more immature. I had the privilege to go to college but my parents don't realize how they've affected me. Or did I let myself be affected and I'm weak? They can SEE I'm not happy but by now I can't even put into words why. I've cried and had panic attacks but they yelled at me through it. I was so humiliated by the end. I'm not allowed to die or grieve for myself. It's selfish. I have 3 younger sisters watching me. My unhappiness is apparently their failure. Some days I wish they'd hit me so I can finally have evidence they hurt me.  **My Sexuality**: I keep to myself, being Catholic and gay has given me lots of empathy. I'm not loud about my sexuality. But love is painfully important to me. In Sophomore year of college my parents dragged me out of the closet. I still remember how my dad kicked in frustration at my chair, narrowly missing me. They threatened to pull me out of college. So I gave up. I didn't pursue anything but even now, I can't it, so many of my stories revolve around love, wlw mostly. Now I've graduated and this topic comes up over and over again. One morning my mom cuts so deeply saying ""You're waiting for something that will never happen. You will never find that."" I don't even want anything scandalous or crazy, I just want a domestic life with a wife, to know and love and live life through with. But they view it so evil...they've scoffed when I've suggested my ""depressive"" and (passive) suicidal state is because I'm not allowed to date a woman. And yet they rub it in my face saying ""God's plan may make me have children"" or kiss and show love to each other in front of me. It angers me so much.  **My Career:** I can say now that I spitefully envy some people in college. Their projects picked up, animations finished, finding internships...But I worked and for the first time in my life was not rewarded for it. I sacrificed parties, dating, social events in school and college, took the hardest classes, all for it to amount to nothing and I have so much regret. Right now my parents want to pull me into their business and even if it does make money, I don't want to be trapped in it like Latino families remain. It's an illusion of choice. My dad yells and says I'm free to decline, but what I am I supposed to do with all that guilt for not ""caring for the family"" or shame when I don't even have a job ready to go to instead?  **Social Media:** I have a decent following on a project account offsite and run it with pride. But a certain party began to gossip and target members of our group type. It's not a happy space anymore. I only stay because I don't need to lose my place to someone who's shallow or  disrespects the subject of my content. Someone used to be helping me talk through things, but I've lost trust in them too, even suspect they orchestrated some gossip with the intent to lure me closer to them, so they could play hero. I haven't heard from them in a while since I expressed suspicions but I hate that its left me not trusting...anyone. Who's out to get me next? I know people online wait for the opportunity to take down someone with a large following or flawless reputations. But then, every time I feel like someone is shit talking me or have clear evidence they are, for a week I can't eat. My stomach hurts, I lose weight, I can't sleep, my heart beats erratically and I lose my breath.  **Myself:** I crave affection and love so badly. I'm ashamed of it. Because admitting that means acknowledging I'm not lovable. I'm an acquired taste, I'm only tolerable if I'm useful or funny. I'm not conventionally attractive. I don't like the bs ""don't say that."" My pessimism, realist views really, won't allow me to believe that. Strangely I still love being in my own body. I can recognize how I cope now. I'm snacking more now. Playing video games is so soothing. I shop for things to add to my collection of my favorite character. I rely heavily on self pleasure, it's one of the only times I feel desirable and mature as a woman.  I'm sorry for rambling and thank anyone who read this far. There are probably lots of many other things I forgot but once I start writing it spills out because I don't talk to anyone. I tried therapy but the site recommended, ugh idk. It was dependent on me to push for conversation (I only got 1 reply a day, then after I completed a task, silence. Was I supposed to start a new task, I don't know! No instruction from my therapist.)  I want to start over. I want to experience young love. I want to warn younger me the advice ""being yourself"" is bs and not always true.  I hate hearing my parents say ""what happened to my little girl"" because FUCK I grew up, suddenly hyperaware and sensitive at the same time. I don't want to die, but I want to be in limbo. I want to be rescued so badly and feel cherished and loved, not because pities my loneliness or hugs me awkwardly but because they see me, want to love what I am as is, and WANT to be around me. No one seeks me out. I crave a breakdown, wounds, ANYTHING for someone to finally look past my jokes and happy face and ask ""are you okay?"" I crave self destruction, but I know my parents will think I'm just being stupid. There is no cry for help. I don't want it ALL to be my fault.  I'm so fucking tired and I don't know how to just, push through it and keep working. I want to work. I can't draw anymore. I want to know if I'm lazy. If what happened in sophomore year being dragged out was what threw me completely off or if I'm being overdramatic and should just move on. I'm terrified of becoming a statistic.

(I don't think thats the right word for it, actions? Responses?) So for the last four years I haven't bring doing great.   In my teen years I dropped to 90 at 5'8 I ate around 750 calories a day. I then saw a pediatrician to help correct that, not wanting to trouble my parents more then I had to I gave up calorie counting. I still struggled with low mood though and depsite being a relatively good student. (Within the 90 range) I dropped chemistry and stopped studying and spent most days playing video games. I got into university where my habits continued to worsen, I stopped seriously studying or caring about my grades. I got an internship in my first year. Then in my second my condition (dramatic flare?) Worsened I almost failed most of my classes and felt nothing. In my second term unable to continue I took the semester off but lied to my parents and wasted 5000 in tuition (I have had mutplie jobs and scholarships (I was very fortunate of this fact) I am not in a concern for money especially as I live at home) and continued to go to school for six months five days a week. Lying to them with what amounted to a fake life as I felt at the time it would be easier then telling them (I didn't want to burden them with my problems). I also managed to land a job that paid me 50 an hour at a very young age as a contractor but barely cared to email my boss back. I felt almost nothing for months but started having what I would appoximate as panic attacks (though this isn't a clinical diagnosis by any means). Where I couldn't breath or breathed rapidly, felt jittery, felt my ribs ache and so on. This would happen anytime after leaving my house.   I took the summer off but I don't know how helpful that was. I don't feel sad I just cry easily and feel apathy toward most things in my life. But this could all be due to my age (relatively young) and how that can lead to a kind of dramatizion of symptoms due to the way young adults can have a tendency to be a little self absorbed. (I am asking random strangers to give a judgement on my life)   So, if anyone actually reads this absurdly long post.

I’ve pretty much had pain everywhere due to stress/worrying myself sick. I’m not on any medication as of now, but I know I need to.   Recently, in the last 3 months or so. Only once a month so far, I get these random flashbacks of old memories or old dreams I’ve had as a little girl. Or sometimes a few years ago. It leaves me feeling pretty confused and just anxious. I’m still aware during them, just feel kind of brain fog but the déjà vu & dream flashbacks really throw me off and scare me. I started reading and read these were focal aware seizures, but hard to diagnose. I did make a doctors appt, but has anybody had this happen and it not be seizures? I’ve been an anxious mess, and feel like since I heard it’s possibly a seizure I can’t focus on anything else in fear I might have a larger seizure at work or in public. 2 of them happened a few days before my period, and shortly after I ate.   I’ve had a lot going on, and just started a new job. I’ve been way more anxious and don’t get the best sleep in fear of work the next day.

He admits he might be a narc or autistic, (his words),hates routine and schedules while saying my mini Pre-K homeschool charts and schedules are ""fine"" and ""a lot"" more than what he wants to do. Some background, I'm a disabled veteran, PTSD from some systematic things that happened around my MST, and an abundance of childhood trauma.   Anyways, I'm pretty sure my ex hook line and sinkered me into being this stay at home parent, from date / day one.   He never checks in or asks about her health, hobbies or anything, he thinks Lakeshore is some new store that he's going to check out. Literally can't even state how much of that is a slap to the face. On top of forgetting about the abuse his parents put me through, like while I was pregnant saying they would hit my child if they saw fit and that I should just wait, she's going to be a toddler and you won't be able to control yourself. Just gooood grandparents, who all of a sudden are at no kings protests?   I'm pretty sure he thinks becauses he pays ""child support"" he doesn't have to make decisions. I've had to push for all health care, he only got her on his IBEW at age 2 after I refused to put her on Medicare, again, after helping my mom with my grandparents hospice journey in California. And moving back to Washington. Yes we were married at time of birth. I ran to catch the post man for my CHAMPVA benefits for her and HIM.   Back to present day, Everytime she comes home she has some kind of road rash or story of major injury that comes out days later from her. Or her potty training regresses. Or her sleep is off  Ive nagged him in to pretty good submission misus all the mental shit he does. Like says he loves my dog, but when we had our other dog the nails got his had good and he punch a hole in the wall about my head height, he is 6'1"", I am 5'3. And I was about 4 months post partum.   I rehomed her, she loves life. He's gotten in my face while  together, after her rehoming,  about giving him a chance to clean when he left mid chore that I then finished for him, ""coffee pot incident"". But he remembers none of it now, typical. There's a laundry list of egregious behavior that isn't technically against the law, just good old fear and malicious incompetence.   Our kid loves him, he takes her to arcades at age 3 and the park, but he also lets her watch my PTSD flashback self hitting and meltdowns when he could easily just go for a walk with her. But instead I have to get him on the same page why it's bad for her to watch me completely implode and feel trapped in my own apartment.  I mean when we were together he would put movies on with inscest in them and forgot despite them being his ""favorite"" then his ""favorite"" adult movie having tweedle dee and dum, well. Anyways theres a reason we aren't together, seperated for 3 years now. And he just is a leech I can't get off of me. I need help, and his is the only one I can get without paying an absurd amount of money for.  Again I'm on a fixed income plus his "" help"". I can't work because I can't, that's why I get my type of disability, unemployable, but having a full time kid is a lot when she's constantly coming back with shifted sleep and no routine on her off days. My mom moves across states soon, but I really feel helpless. I've had therapists tell me to go make friends and then this last one when I compared myself to a used tampon, hour 7 with TSS setting in, instead of going further down the analogy she just wrote it off as self hate.  I'm tired of the constant standing up. My legs and heart are tired. Plus the state of the nation. It's like my mental health doesn't matter, just suck it up like everyone else. Or when I do that and get out of my head, I am ""full of myself and arrogant, and thinks I'm better than everyone else"" I don't get out of my head too often since that's how I come off. I just want to run off into the woods and be some kind of Ms Honey, green witchy witch and raise my kid.

I only glanced at the sun for two seconds which is hilariously not enough time to damage your vision but I still convinced myself that the “far away blurriness” I was seeing had to do with me looking at the sun. I went to the eye doctor and she told me that my eyes were healthy,it’s just that my anxiety made me hyper aware of my vision for the first time and made me realize that I was near sighted this whole time.  Despite having this reassurance I would still have panic attacks which gave me even more symptoms that kept me in a loop for months. Well, eventually all of my 30+ symptoms went away and I went on with my life.  Unfortunately my anxiety is back. Last month I stayed home for the entire month of August out of stress because of a financial issue. I pulled an all nighter and went to bed only for three hours. When I woke up I noticed that I was still drowsy/tired and it led me to panic for some reason. Ever since then I haven’t felt “real”. Sometimes I’ll make some food and I’ll be like “why are my hands stirring the eggs in a bowl?” Or “how did I get in this room so fast?” or “who’s voice is that speaking?” Noticing this has led me to weeks of panic attacks which made me lightheaded.  The only symptoms I have are :  -not feeling real, feeling like a robot  -the occasional lightheadedness after noticing the derealization or after a panic attack  My doc has told me that I am healthy and gave me a referral to see a psychiatrist.

My days go by as usual and I wake up normal but I start to get sudden switches that can happen randomly or be triggered by something like just seeing a picture of myself. All of the sudden I feel that everything just turns grey. It gets swallowed up by a void that becomes all I can think about.

I’m a 24-year-old male, and since August 7th, 2025, I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety. It came on suddenly in the middle of the day — to the point where moving even an inch felt impossible without feeling like I was going to pass out. The first attack included: 	•	Numbness in my hands 	•	Nausea 	•	Racing heartbeat 	•	Shortness of breath 	•	Lightheadedness 	•	Loss of appetite 	•	Chills 	•	…and more  It happened to me twice in that one day. Up until then, I believed I was in decent shape and mentally healthy.  A week later, I started experiencing panic attacks every other day. One day I’d feel fine, and the next I’d be hit hard with anxiety. I also had a few days of depression. At first, I believed my health was the cause, but even after I felt more at peace with that, the anxiety didn’t go away — it just shifted.  ⸻  Weight changes  Over the past month, I’ve noticed significant weight and muscle loss. I started at 135 lb (61 kg), and as of September 24th, 2025, I’m down to 115 lb (52 kg).  ⸻  Cycles of recovery and relapse  I had 5 days where I felt like I had finally healed from anxiety, but unfortunately it came back in cycles. Recently it’s been worse — not with the same intense panic attacks as at the start, but more of a constant, lingering anxiety that feels just as draining.  ⸻  Current symptoms 	•	Strange sensations like Alice in Wonderland Syndrome 	•	Increased heart rate when trying to sleep 	•	Lying in bed for 4–5 hours before I can finally fall asleep, only getting maybe 2 hours of rest 	•	Waking up with a racing heart and overwhelming thoughts of doom and negativity 	•	Last night I finally fell asleep, but only for 20 minutes, and the dream itself was stressful and terrifying  The hardest part has been going to sleep and waking up with anxiety still there, making it difficult to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  ⸻  Medication  I’ve been prescribed Fluoxetine (10 mg capsule), but I’m unsure if I should start it or wait to see if I can heal naturally — if that’s even possible.  ⸻  What I’m looking for 	•	Advice on coping strategies 	•	Exercises or practices that helped you 	•	Dietary tips that supported your recovery 	•	Your personal experience — if you’ve gone through something similar, how did you overcome it? 	•	Any thoughts on whether this is something I can heal from naturally or if medication is the better path",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1npo6xh/anxiety_out_of_nowhere/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1npo6xh/anxiety_out_of_nowhere/

You might ask why did I stick to it for so long if it’s not working for me, and the answer is that I really really hoped it would work with time. And as I am unwell I just don’t know if there’s anything else out there that could help me.  I tried psychoanalysis, more general therapy and switched therapist 4 times. Went both in-person and online, and have been going at least weekly. I was aware of my childhood trauma when I started and already unpacked 99% of what I know now before therapy, thanks to some very supportive and loving friends and family and books. But understanding things doesn’t translate to feeling them in a healthy way for me.  I talked about the same issues a billion times. It always gets into the direction of childhood trauma, and most of the times I already know the answer to her questions or remarks. Some of my friends who go to therapy really praise the process and tell me about their a-ha moments and I literally never had one. I’m very open and vulnerable in front of my therapist and I don’t hold back. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.  I feel like it’s a waste of time and money. But I feel like it’s my only chance to get better and I’m desperate.  I have crippling depression, I hate myself a lot and I have lot of shame and self-doubt.

I hope this is the appropriate sub for this question but since anxiety is the main reason I come here today, I think it is.   Disclaimer : english is not my native language.  Anyway, I came here because I need advice.   Saturday, I am invited to the birthday of one of my cousin (she's celebrating 30 so it's not nothing).  At first, it was planned I would go with my mother and spent the day before returning home. But there is/was the possibility to spend the night there. I don't like sleeping at places I'm not familiar with, so going to the gathering only for the day was perfect for me. But my mother can't make it so my traveling-back ticket is not longer available >!(it was the only one) !<Today, my sister told me I could sleep in some ""converted truck >!(it won't be there just for me, it will have other uses)!<  And this is the problem :  1. I already have sleeping issues and it's hard for me to sleep well in unfamiliar places like I said, plus I have a condition where sleep privacy and stress can be problematic. 2. I need to go to the bathroom at least 1 time in a night, it won't be possible in that truck >!(unless to go outside) !< 3. I'm pretty chilly at night and I have no idea if there will be enough blankets. I'm the kind of person who needs a warm blanket and a plaid. Also, I hate flat pillows because this is the kind of thing that can't ruin me a night.  I don't want to ask if I will have access to the bathroom in the middle of the night and if they have multiple blankets and pillows. I don't want to because they already found a solution for me to come but it's not enough because I need my princess's little comfort. I don't want to take the arm of someone when they gladly offer their hand.  **I know this is something it will give me anxiety if I go to the party so how can I write a message to tell my cousin I'm not coming ?**  **I can't say I have other plans because I saw her today and I told her ""see you on saturday"" when saying goodbye. It would be rude to send a message on the saturday morning pretending to be a little sick because she will have doubts and I don't feel lying like this. In normal circonstances, I would have love to come but there is too many unknowns for me to be ""reassured"". While my mother and sister are aware of what I just said, my cousin doesn't know and I don't want to explain the details like I did here. I try to go outside my comfort zone but I don't think it will be the good moment for that.**  I'm sorry this post is so long but I wanted to give you the most context. If the party was hosted by my sister or my mother, I could ask about the blankets, the access to the bathroom but I'm not close enough with my cousin to do that.

Since roughly middle school age, he has shown signs of being ""tempermentally different"" than other children. He didn't bond with many kids in school or have many friends initially and just seemed socially withdrawn and was very shy and insecure initially. He also had a tendency to be very aggressive with other kids whenever they said or did something he didn't like. Teachers would even bring up these concerns with me and even called us in for a meeting about it. He got into numerous fights and beat many kids up for ""perceived offenses.""  After initially believing he must be either autistic or adhd, I took him to a neurologist for a series of tests. I was told by the doctor that he seems ""normal"" and that he hopefully will outgrow some of these issues. Well fast forward to now and he still does not seem to be bonding with others, and his anger issues have grown dramatically. He has opened up about some of his current frustrations, and they are as follows:  . He expects every girl to look at him everywhere he goes. It causes him serious anger when they don't. Claims he's the ""hottest guy they've ever seen in their life"" and that they should be looking at him.  . Also highly prefers that every other guy be uglier than him or ugly in general, to ensure he's the best looking out there. This causes him major anger as well.  . Has a very explosive temper, and even minor perceived offense could causes to snap and verbally/physically assault someone. He has genuinely scared the crap out of people and traumatized them over this.   . Has demonstrated 0 empathy whatsoever so far in his life toward anyone.     With tears rolling down my face as I type this, I am distraught. I never wanted my son to be like this. I didn't raise him to be. I'm saddened by this issue he has and wish he could find peace. He knows he has a problem but idk if he's willing to seek help. I want to reach out to someone and see if any professional out there can help with this. I am posting this here as I am curious if anyone else has had experience with an issue like this, and even knows what to do. I am scared he'll end up in jail at this rate.

It's either horrible and unreasonable fear of anything or constantly wanting to die.   I never really told anyone this but recently I've been feeling way more overwhelmed and exhausted than usual. I'm so tired of studying, of thinking about my future job and life, so many responsibilities. I've started falling behind, and I have no energy at all to do anything about it. Socialising has been extremely hard for the past few months and everything gets so boring... I don't want to end up without a stable job but I really just have no energy. I genuinely don't even remember how it was like to not feel like this.   I've been going to different therapists since I was 12 but it always just makes me so so tired and bad about myself. Meds originally helped but as you could have guessed, they don't now and most psychiatrists don't even take me seriously. I never got any diagnosis besides them telling me I have anxiety disorder, so I'm not even sure if I have depression, what if I'm just dramatic and overstressed and it's nothing?  So I have a couple of suicide plans but when I even try to get myself to start realising them I get scared... I've been a coward all my life. I never tried (out of fear) alcohol, smoking, drugs, self harm, so I don't really have anything to cope, even if it's unhealthy. I was thinking of getting into a psych ward but I'm so scared of that too, what if it's even more awful? And I'm scared of people. Besides even if I got into a psych ward what after that? I would miss out on years of studying and how do I start my life from there?   I can't really tell anyone about it because it's always either that I'm dramatic or 'plz don't do it'. I appreciate their care but it doesn't help me at all. I just wish there was someone who could listen to me without desperately wanting to stray me away from it.  I don't fucking know what I'm supposed to do, my life objectively is not bad and it just makes me feel so much more pathetic. And I'm also not sure what I'm so scared of about suicide, maybe pain? On top of that I started struggling with my body image, and it's getting scary to even change clothes (I don't want to look at myself).

So I’ve always had anxiety and depression, I’ve always learnt how to deal with it. However for the past two weeks I have truly been suffering. I had an anxiety attack last Monday that has lead to constant shakiness, palpitations, intrusive thoughts, etc. I am so lucky, as both my parents, grandmother and uncle have been of massive support through these times. I am having a really hard time even staying out of bed, as I am writing this I am shaking, I just want to feel normal. Yesterday I visited an endocrinologist and it seems I might be having issues with my thyroid that may be causing this, but I am honestly exhausted. I have a feeling of constant doom and dread and just… awful. Please give me some kind words on your recovery/remission. I would be so grateful.   have a nice day everybody.   TLDR; 26F with panic attack symptoms for the past 2 weeks just needs a little support and kind words of encouragement.",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npp1yf/26f_going_through_mental_health_crisis_trying_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npp1yf/26f_going_through_mental_health_crisis_trying_my/

But he stays in his bedroom for a week or more at a time. He has meals in there. His apartment mate had his girlfriend move in so now my son isn’t comfortable leaving his room. He has a few friends. The same friends he’s had since he was 3 years old. How can I help him? He speaks with a therapist. But he’s expensive (doesn’t accept insurance) so my son only has appointments with him every 6 weeks or so. He’s never had a girlfriend. He stays home in his room for weeks at a time. I don’t want him to feel like I’m judging him and I don’t want him to feel like I have nothing else to talk to him about. But I don’t really know what to talk to him about except work.

So i will try and explain as best i can.  Basically as above, we had recently been through a miscarriage 2 and a half weeks ago(found out 3). I have diagnosed depression since i was about 19 so I've had my fair share of episodes and also had various therapies/medication to deal with this. Obviously lately i have been very low to the point of not want to do any chores or socialising due to the sensitive event that has happened. Me and my partner keep having various arguments over this because he thinks i need help and that me sitting on the sofa playing on my tablet or watching tv is unhealthy. I have told him numerous times that this is how i deal with it and usually i will start to do certain things and get back into routines but i just need a bit of time thats all. He has expressed hes burnt out so there have been times where i have cooked and done a few chores, just not as much as he has but he says its not enough and i need to do more and get help. I just want to add he also made a sarcastic/jokey comment saying ""ohh all ive done is sit down and chill on the sofa(couch)"" which got me irritated in the first place.   I dont know what else i can do or say.

Was hooked on high doses of Benzos (11 years of 8mg +) and have now been off of them for 2 years. Went to heavy drinking to sleep and deal with anxiety. Then quit drinking and switched to weed. Now trying to not use that either. Been testing out different magnesiums. Glycinate seems to be the only one that helps me with sleep. I take 2 in the morning and 1 in the evening of Solaray brand. Comes to about 262mg of magnesium. It has been getting me a regular 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Still wake up once or twice and have some dreams but not like the nightmares and 1 hour of sleep that I use to get. But it is causing intestinal issues. If I drop down to just 2 per day, the intestinal issues stop but the sleep also goes back to about 1 hour per night with nightmares. All other forms of magnesium cause diarrhea for me.  I've tried things like skull cap and others that relax me for a short time but dont seem to help with sleep. They also aren't recommended for long term use.

You might ask why did I stick to it for so long if it’s not working for me, and the answer is that I really really hoped it would work with time. And as I am unwell I just don’t know if there’s anything else out there that could help me.  I tried psychoanalysis, more general therapy and switched therapist 4 times. Went both in-person and online, and have been going at least weekly. I was aware of my childhood trauma when I started and already unpacked 99% of what I know now before therapy, thanks to some very supportive and loving friends and family and books. But understanding things doesn’t translate to feeling them in a healthy way for me.  I talked about the same issues a billion times. It always gets into the direction of childhood trauma, and most of the times I already know the answer to her questions or remarks. Some of my friends who go to therapy really praise the process and tell me about their a-ha moments and I literally never had one. I’m very open and vulnerable in front of my therapist and I don’t hold back. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.  I feel like it’s a waste of time and money.

Need advice from those with severe anxiety & are/have been pregnant","Hey everyone, please help ease my mind.   I'm wanting to start a family with my partner, sooner than later but still a few years down the road I think, I want to get way more healthy in life and in my mind first..  the biggest obstacle for me is half the meds I'm taking to keep me even just remotely somewhat normal are not good during pregnancy (pregabalin, vyvanse). After my traumatic experience and before meds, almost every single thing would send me into a body-consuming panic, I couldn't even watch animal planet. (I was already dealing with intense anxiety and other issues that caused me to be housebound for years before this event too. It just got way worse) Then they placed me on pregabalin, and my entire world changed. I finally felt like I could breathe and my body wasn't in complete panic mode all the time. I still had a lot of focus issues, some overstimulation and executive dysfunction (hence the vyvanse), & i still had some anxiety, but at least I could sit and watch smth without feeling like I was going to die, & things started to interest me again. Therapy didn't seem to help until the meds. Meditation sometimes helps with the anxiety, but at a certain point nothing at all works except a trip to the emergency room, though I haven't needed emergency care for my mental health since going on pregabalin, which is probably why I'm so petrified to imagine my life without it.  I know I need to wean myself off of pregabalin eventually if I want to have a baby, I'm just absolutely sent into panic when I imagine going off pregabalin again. I could deal with the vyvanse, it would be uncomfortable & lots of overstimulation but it would be doable, I just don't think I could stop both at once, especially pregabalin. Even the mornings now before my meds kick in, it feels like i'm right back where I was. Any others here that have high anxiety and/or trauma that only meds seem to help, and have gotten pregnant and how did you deal with it? I've read buspirone and hydroxyzine are sometimes prescribed, but idk how effective they are for severe anxiety. Also SSRIs, but i'm already on a pretty high dose of zoloft. Walks and exercise too of course, but at a certain point that does not work and sometimes makes me feel more panicked & overstimulated.   This is one of the times where I'm waiting for my meds to kick in and this is ruminating in my brain, because all I can think of is this panic I feel in the mornings is how you're going to feel pregnant, but worse, because you're also pregnant lol. So honestly even if I shouldn't be thinking abt this rn and it's a few years down the road, it's whats plaguing my mind right now and just would like some reassurance or advice, whatever you are willing to offer. I'm on birth control, but there's always a low possibility it could happen, and I don't think I could personally be able to get an abortion, even though I fully support it there are reasons I couldn't do it that I don't want to get into, but i'd end up having to do it if things were bad enough. so I guess I'm also scared, even though it's a very low possibility, that it could happen NOW & then I'd have to deal with that & a potential abortion & that will mess me up.   Anyways, sorry for all the text and if I seem panicky or rambly or if I'm just being silly and in my head... thank you so much for reading and have a peaceful autumn day!! 🍂🧡✨️  Edit: oh I should also mention, I smoke a lot of weed rn for my anxiety (though in all honesty I think it's making parts of it worse lol), so I'd have to wean myself off of that too. But that's the least of my worries. I'd also have to quit my nicotine pen. The vyvanse actually makes it easier to not smoke weed, so lots of things at once lol, which is why ideally I'd like to wean down these things, the pregabalin is just my biggest worry.",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1npq1po/want_to_eventually_get_pregnant_just_have_a_lot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1npq1po/want_to_eventually_get_pregnant_just_have_a_lot/

Therapy didn't seem to help until the meds. Meditation sometimes helps with the anxiety, but at a certain point nothing at all works except a trip to the emergency room, though I haven't needed emergency care for my mental health since going on pregabalin, which is probably why I'm so petrified to imagine my life without it.  I know I need to wean myself off of pregabalin eventually if I want to have a baby, I'm just absolutely sent into panic when I imagine going off pregabalin again. I could deal with the vyvanse, it would be uncomfortable & lots of overstimulation but it would be doable, I just don't think I could stop both at once, especially pregabalin. Even the mornings now before my meds kick in, it feels like i'm right back where I was. Any others here that have high anxiety and/or trauma that only meds seem to help, and have gotten pregnant and how did you deal with it? I've read buspirone and hydroxyzine are sometimes prescribed, but idk how effective they are for severe anxiety. Also SSRIs, but i'm already on a pretty high dose of zoloft. Walks and exercise too of course, but at a certain point that does not work and sometimes makes me feel more panicked & overstimulated.   This is one of the times where I'm waiting for my meds to kick in and this is ruminating in my brain, because all I can think of is this panic I feel in the mornings is how you're going to feel pregnant, but worse, because you're also pregnant lol. So honestly even if I shouldn't be thinking abt this rn and it's a few years down the road, it's whats plaguing my mind right now and just would like some reassurance or advice, whatever you are willing to offer. I'm on birth control, but there's always a low possibility it could happen, and I don't think I could personally be able to get an abortion, even though I fully support it there are reasons I couldn't do it that I don't want to get into, but i'd end up having to do it if things were bad enough. so I guess I'm also scared, even though it's a very low possibility, that it could happen NOW & then I'd have to deal with that & a potential abortion & that will mess me up.   Anyways, sorry for all the text and if I seem panicky or rambly or if I'm just being silly and in my head... thank you so much for reading and have a peaceful autumn day!! 🍂🧡✨️",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npq79p/want_to_eventually_get_pregnant_just_have_a_lot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1npq79p/want_to_eventually_get_pregnant_just_have_a_lot/

When my mom would be late from work I would go into a full blown panic and think something happened to her and I wouldn’t calm down until she was home and i saw her with my own eyes, just to give an example.  Recently my anxiety has gotten so so much worse, but it used to be about everything and anything from having to go get gas to my schoolwork. But now I find that my anxiety is SOLELY based on my loved ones dying. I am genuinely so scared of any of them dying and I know obviously this is common fear no one wants their loved ones to die. But I mean I think about it constantly, it makes me break down into tears and it seriously stops me from doing anything like my school work because i’m so worried. The thing that finally made me want to even talk about this is because for the past two weeks it’s been constant breakdown after breakdown thinking about my grandmother passing away and how I don’t even know how I would live without her. It’s honestly so exhausting and I feel so stupid even saying it cause I feel like this is life and life happens but I can’t help it.   I just wanted to see if anyone has ever dealt with this and how did they go about it. I’ve gone to therapy before as a teenager but I haven’t since then but I’m thinking i should because it’s getting to a point where I cry 2-3 times a day and have a breakdown about it and I have NO one to talk to because I don’t think they’ll understand.

During all of this I have visited my GP 4 times for mental health support, to which all that was offered was an increase to the highest dose of antidepressants I can have, and being told I am on the 1 year waiting list for a therapist.   Obviously, this is all too much grief for me to handle. I’m living alone at the moment and although I am sensible, it is too much.   I don’t have plans to do anything, but it is constantly on my mind. I can’t have any more medication as I’m maxed out.   I am at a complete loss at what to do. My best friends just recently got into relationships so I am having no support from them, not that it’s their responsibility.   I’m currently staying at a work friends house as I don’t feel it’s great for me to be alone right now.   My last idea is the mental health support at the hospital. I’m not sure what they could do but the last time I went years ago they assessed whether I was safe to go home and I got to speak to a mental health specialist face to face which I haven’t been able to do due to the years waiting list I am on.

She prescribed me 20 pills the beginning of the year and I just am about to run out. I have an appointment with her tomorrow on the phone, to request a refill, but I know she’s going to push Lexapro on me which I don’t want to take and I just want another Set of Ativan for emergency cases.

Sometimes I find myself envious of followers of Christ or really followers of any religion. I’m a “gotta see it, to believe it” kinda person. I wish it came easy to me to follow what a book says and have faith in a higher power, but I just can’t. I feel silly doing it.  I often think those who follow are also silly and foolish. That being said, most religious people I know personally have much better mental health and kind perspectives of others.   I guess I envy them for allowing themselves to depend on this higher being for help and guidance. The way I see it, that help and guidance will never come. You have to do it yourself.  Maybe it’s because my dad died when I was 9. I literally had to talk to the phone operator bc the person I was with couldn’t speak English enough. Now why would god put little 9 year old me in that position?  I do see now, how that hardship made a butterfly effect. My sister was pushed out of a bad relationship, my mom got to explore life in whole different ways and is now remarried, and I grew up to be not as spoiled as I would’ve been. Either way, it does not justify his death, especially if god dictates it.   I just wish I could blindly have faith like you guys do.

1npqqwt,1758754717,2025-09-24T22:58:37Z,offmychest,trauma after being cheated on,"this is gonna be really long so I apologise    i’m (20F) in a fairly new relationship with this amazing man (21M), like absolutely amazing in every single way - he’s gorgeous, works on himself, treats me to things, i’ve met his family (which is something i’ve never done with someone before), he took me to a cricket match with them… etc. Absolutely adore him with my whole heart but the trauma from my last relationship is honestly so debilitating and exhausting.  My last relationship lasted almost 3 years before my ex bf cheated on my the first week in uni. This happened a year ago and while I am over the man who did this, I still have episodes of crying outbursts, panic attacks, and i’m so so scared it’s going to ruin this relationship I have with my bf.   There’s nothing i’m directly doing to sabotage it, it’s just i’ve never spoken in detail about my past relationship and how it’s affected me and this relationship but it’s more for the obvious reason of, why would I talk about a guy from my past yano. It’s more like intrusive thoughts of ‘this man is going to hurt you like the last one did’ but nothing he does points towards it, it’s like the relationship is so good it feels like it’s not true? but it does, but like I have doubts but then when i’m with him the doubts disappear. I completely trust the guy fullheartedly and i’m also a believer that if a man wants to cheat, he’ll find a way to do it- nothing you do or say to prevent it will actually prevent it because it’s not a problem with you it’s a problem with them. And I suppose because this man is so much more secure with himself I feel reassured but I suppose cheating is traumatic as i’ve realised over the past year.  The problem I had with my last bf was I loved him unconditionally, even tho my mother told me you should never love anyone except your children unconditionally. I’ve never been the type of girl to feel untrusting of my partner, i’ve never for one second doubted anything they do, who they meet up with, where they go, yet now I feel so fucking stuck because I still go about things the same way like never saying I feel off about someone or asking where they’re going bla bla bla but I have these lingering awful doubts like what if this is all too good to be true   I spoke to my bf tonight about this for the first time and mentioned how I might want to bring it up in therapy tomorrow, but i’m in therapy for my eating disorder so I have a feeling they won’t care for the conversation. Anyway I basically said that I think I have trauma from my past relationship and it’s making me cry because I feel so so scared of getting hurt again even tho it’s irrational and I trust you… he responded with ‘I don’t know what I can do to help’, to which I said that’s fine i’m not saying this as an ask for help i’m just telling you. we then just moved on the convo and that was that. Feels slightly unresolved and he left the call 10 minutes later and I cried for yet the third time today. i’m like so pathetic jesus christ I just wanna have thick skin and be this ‘perfect’ girl that he had in his image when he first met me (he actually asked me if I was one of those crazy emotional insane girls because I like hello kitty and I told him no but like, yeah stupid stereotype but I am emotional and FEEL crazy all the time).   that’s it idk what this post is for rlly i’m just like, traumatised and I read that apparently the trauma from getting cheated on takes like 5-8 years to get over and even then ur never really over it and it changes u, and it has. and I wish it never did. The main thing I worry about is whether my bf will take me saying i’m emotional over getting cheated on in the past as a way of saying i’m not over the relationship because I am. He said he understands that that’s hard to get over and that’s all the reassurance he gave me, he didn’t say anything else- which is like fine I don’t expect him to ‘fix’ me, I just want some reassurance I guess sometimes :/    .",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npqqwt/trauma_after_being_cheated_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npqqwt/trauma_after_being_cheated_on/

Lo and behold he had to be the one who found them in the couch cushions where they must’ve fallen from my pocket.  Figures.

He's gone from being the most kind, patient, and available man to the most volatile, angry, and borderline scary person I know. He can literally go from being all smiles and laughing to screaming the house down over something as small as accidentally spilling a glass of water, and we're all exhausted.  Growing up, I had to be on constant high alert because you truly never knew what would set him off. I learned how to tell someone's mood by their footsteps, how they closed a door, or even a sigh, and prepare accordingly. Being in constant fight-or-flight while my brain was still developing has had a catastrophic impact on me. I'm depressed, always anxious, and terrified of people, because in my mind, everybody is unpredictable and one mistake away from completely losing it on you. This has affected my school and work performance, and my relationships with people. I have next to no friends because I'm constantly walking on eggshells around everybody and automatically expecting the worst.  We've ALL made it abundantly clear that his anger is a problem and seriously negatively affects us, but it seems like he couldn't care less, because he makes no effort to better himself. He doesn't see a psychiatrist, he doesn't go to therapy. All he does is apologize after his explosions, like he expects ""I'm sorry"" to be magic words that will just erase all the damage he does, so that he doesn't have to change his behavior and take accountability. No matter what we say to him, nothing works. He still won't get help.  My brother (17M) both avoid him whenever we can. We've learned that it's just easier to hole ourselves up in our rooms and ignore him as best as we can...which has led our dad to the conclusion that he's this poor, unappreciated victim whose children are being cold to him on purpose.  He and my mom have been married for almost 25 years, and even she once admitted to me that she's glad to have me and my brother, but when it comes to my dad, she wishes she ""would've made a different choice,"" but feels like there's nothing she can do about it now, because it's been so long (sunk cost fallacy). She's an angel of a woman who deserves so much better, and so do us kids. We deserve a better role model and father, but I know we'll never have that, because mom is extremely religious and doesn't believe in divorce.  I'm tired of walking on eggshells 24/7. I want to get out of this house just so I don't have to deal with him anymore, but I'm disabled and completely reliant on him for financial support, so I don't know what to do.

I’m trying to find any good news about denuclearization around the world (and specifically involving Russia), because I genuinely cannot sleep anymore, and I get extremely paranoid whenever me or my family leave the house because “what if a nuke happens”.

It really is as the title says-- I (15F, if that matters) hate myself. My looks, my personality, etc.  My hatred of my looks is really shallow, to be honest. I just wish I were more cute and feminine.  I think that my mental health has really taken a nosedive recently, and I'm not really sure why. I'm in my junior year right now, but that's not really placing any stress on me. I have, however, not been getting along with my mom very well recently, so that may be a contributing factor.  Since about a few years ago, I've had some fairly awful things happen to me. My father disowned me entirely and we haven't had any contact in 3 years, though now it's getting closer to 4. I never stopped hurting. It's making me extremely bitter. I've also had a few extended episodes of extremely poor mental health, which I've yet to seek help for.  I feel horrendously annoying. I rapidly oscillate between being an ass and being a massive pushover. I'll go on and on and on about something or other that upset me in a way, only to instantly 'flip' my mood so as to not drag down anyone else (though I know that this is ineffectual). I feel like people hate me for it, and it makes me just feel like a bad person, even if I'm told otherwise.  I often find myself afraid of people deciding they've had enough of me. I can't describe why it happens, but I always feel I've pushed everyone in my life to the edge. Whenever they show potential signs of being annoyed/upset at me, I lose my everloving shit and end up spiraling. I have no issues with direct confrontation, and am able to remain in at least decent control of myself. I wish people wouldn't be so fucking vague about everything, and I wish they wouldn't act like I'm going to get into a tub and slash my wrists because they said something I did annoyed them.  I don't really have much else to say here, so. Take this as you will.

I've been living with my adoptive mom in rent-assisted public housing. Last week my family staged an ""intervention"" for me. My brother, sister, aunt, and mother were all there, and they all took turns talking about how I'm lazy, spoiled, and wasting my life away because I have no job (I genuinely cant find one, I've put in over 35+ applications just this month) and just sit in my room playing videogames. They told me it's too much for my old mother to handle and that I need to start being realistic. They said that I'm an adult and I need to grow up and stop expecting my family to hold my hand through everything, then said that I have a month to fill out an application for public housing and leave, or else my mom will have the police forcibly remove me from her home, however the minimum wait times for my town's public housing is usually around six months minimum. The other issue is not only do I not have a job, I have a pretty severe mental health history, and was just recently released from a psych hold following an attempt. I also have ADHD and severe Tourettes Syndrome, which is probably another reason I've had such a hard time getting a job. I'm terrified, not only of being homeless, but also of the fact that I'm genuinely not sure I'll even be able to take care of myself if I do manage to find my own place to live. I'm not lying when I say I don't have anywhere else to go, as the only other family I have in my town is my abusive father. I don't know what to do, I've always been the black sheep in my family, but I kinda thought they'd give me more time, or at least a more of a realistic notice than just a month, maybe I'm being unreasonable, but it just feels so unfair, especially when my other siblings have done nothing to help my mother, but then want to shift the blame on me for why her health is declining and why she can't afford her bills and groceries. I understand wanting me gone, I can even get behind that idea, as obviously I don't want to live with her forever, but this just feels impossible. I just finished filling out the forms for public housing but as I said the average wait time is six months to a year, and even if I do get one I have no source of income and no idea where to look for a job, I live in a small town and I've pretty much applied to every place I possibly could qualify for.

First off, I’m 25f and I have been struggling with my mental health since I was 12. My mom got sick, I started binge eating from anxiety and things went downhill.  My mom died at when I was 14. After she died my dad had a new girlfriend within 1 month. She absolutely hated me and still does, she and my dad made my life miserable after that, he even told me once my mom was gone he wasn’t really “apart of the family”  So I have no contact with pretty much anyone. I never had a big family, most have passed. My dad lives with his girlfriend and their kids 8 hours away. And they guilt me for not coming to see them and deny it all  When I was little I dreamed of being an actress.. I worked really hard for all these years and failed miserably. I spent every penny I had on it and even went into debt. In 2024 I FINALLY got an agent.. everyone else I know was signed within 2 years, it took me 14 years of applying to every agent monthly.  Finally get signed and can’t book to save my life, however I booked the lead in a movie. It was non union, so not enough to change my life and hardly an accomplishment for the years I put in however.. I spent 15 days on set and it was absolutely an incredible experience. I got hair and makeup, wardrobe and they ordered me a coffee and breakfast every morning. I was on cloud 9 and I’m so grateful. It’s almost like the universe was giving me something so I could “live my dreams” for a few days before I ended things, without giving me something big that would keep me alive.   I haven’t had an audition in a few weeks, and if I don’t get one by Friday then I’m taking that as my final sign since I won’t be waiting to hear back on anything.  Also, I’m so incredibly broke and everything I own is starting to break all at once.. my laptop.  My transmission on my car is literally on its last legs and I can’t afford a new one. Nobody will care about me or be sad, which is comforting for me to know my death won’t really matter.  It just feels like I’m at the end, and I’m fully ready.

1npsxns,1758760792,2025-09-25T00:39:52Z,mentalhealth,How do I fix this?,"I don’t really know how to say this best, which honestly is pretty good foreshadowing for what I’m actually going to be talking about. I suck at communicating- point blank, and it’s really starting to piss off the people I care about in my life.   The main thing is that I don’t communicate at all, even when I want to, and when I do, it’s meager at best. Even people I’ve known for years, I barely speak a word to, and it’s really not that I don’t want to or that I’m not interested in their life and what's going on in it, it’s that I physically feel like I can’t.   Every time I try to speak, I have to do damage control before I say a word, thinking about how it could be interpreted and how the person may react. In fact, I expect people to respond negatively, even to mundane questions like “how was your week?” I think about how to formulate my question so that I can minimize the chances of an adverse reaction all while trying to work up the courage to say something. Sometimes it’s not extremely hard to do but other times I think it would be easier to put my hand on a hot stove.   When I finally get the courage to open up I feel better in the moment but as more time passes the more i feel regret and unease at the fact that i gave someone that information, even if i trust the person it as if my body does not. Another problem I have is that often I “play” responses in my head forgetting somehow that I'm actually supposed to verbally respond to people and that they cannot hear my thoughts.  I think this may also partly stem from the fact that “thinking” feels so much safer and controlled than speaking which is riskier. However I know that this almost mute like personality does no good for my growth as a human being in fact it directly suppresses it.  The worst part is that the rational part of me knows how stupid it is, like why should I care if someone responds negatively? But it really feels like an instinctual freeze reaction that I’m “stuck” in. I know that this lack of communication appears to others as disinterest, self-absorption, and probably a great deal of ungratefulness which may be the case, I don't know. All I know is that if it were easier I’d probably be a lot more social but part of me still doesn’t really understand why my opinion/engagement is relevant. I mean, I know rationally it’s not fun to do all the talking to what is essentially a human wall, truthfully it’s probably very unsettling.   Of course I'm aware that people aren’t hyperanalyzing every response I say. I’m not that delusional. Every person has their own lives that they are absorbed by. Still, I feel that people often make conclusions about everything you say, even subconsciously, as if everything you do and say becomes part of a subconscious or conceptual picture/ interpretation of yourself. Maybe the fact is just that I really hate being perceived, I hate that people know things about me that shape a picture of me in their minds, I hate having an actual physical body that people can “read” expressions on, I don’t have a poker face, so when I’m upset people can tell even if I wish they couldn’t.    I don’t know how can I fix this, I know trying to brute force my way through this hasn’t been helping and l think I should probably get therapy.

I'm going to be a brief as possible but this is kinda the combination of a lot of complex thoughts and traumas, so sorry if I fail lol.  Over the last four years I have been in 3 relationships, all of which weren't very good in retrospect. They've imprinted the jealousy and toxicity that my exes refuse to acknowledge, and made my anxiety worse. I find that it wasn't until I left that I realized I stopped a lot of the little things that made me happy. I was fully planning to be single for a while when my now boyfriend seemed to fall clear out of they sky. (We are in the same friend group but never knew we both had feelings, etc etc) Due to both our not the best experience, we're taking things very slow and seeing where the road takes us.  I have *never* been so happy in all the years I've been alive. I've never felt so wanted or seen or appreciated, I've never felt so relaxed and I'm never waiting for the other shoe to drop when he's near. I didn't know you could actually get lost in someone's eye, I thought it was a phrase. I have has such personal growth too! My anxiety has been better, I've started writing and doing my makeup again, I don't worry about saying the wrong thing or tripping up (at least when he's there); the tide has really risen all ships.   ***HERES WHERE THE QUSTION IS***  My only issue is this: I'm so worried so constant about bothering him, or saying the wrong thing, or making the wrong decision; about being around too often or not enough; about not having big enough ambitions etc. I know it's not true because I can talk freely with him always and he tells me so, but that doesn't stop the spiraling. I feel like I have to just have blind faith that he loves me and all is, and will be, good and just.....idk exist?  Sorry y'all, that's a rambling mess. Just miscellaneous thoughts a can't seem to unravel and that seem hell bent on pulling me back down again.

Paranoia has been getting to me and I really need advice... Here are the biggest issues right now.  -Noises: I used to live in a small town and moved to the city a few years ago but I still had this problem back home as well, just more severe in the city. I constantly feel on edge and every little noise makes me nervous. Every rumble, deep noise, planes, cars, sounds that are unidentifiable. Especially rumbles and deeper noises. I keep feeling like something horrible is going to happen or it's the end of the world or I'm in danger.  -Being out alone: I feel scared to walk to school alone. It got so bad last year that I stopped attending classes. Since switching majors, I've been getting rides to school every day and it's helped me so much but I really think that this fear is holding me back from experiencing so much. It's also embarrassing to be dropped off at school when everyone else walks. At this point I just say I live far away if someone asks.   -Building collapsing: This sounds really stupid but it keeps me up at night. Since moving, I've been living in a tall apartment building. It's terrifying. Sometimes I'll feel vibrations and I feel like the building is going to collapse. I feel like I feel swaying every day but then I realize it's my heartbeat or me swaying but it still scares me. I keep imagining the building falling down or collapsing somehow.  I realize all of these don't seem very logical when typed out, but I literally can't stop worrying about them no matter how much research I do about architecture or whatever my concerns are at that point in time.

I usually take it on my left arm but after consistently getting lower readings I was curious and tried my right arm, my right arm has significantly higher blood pressure readings…  Example:  Left arm 110/68  Right arm 128/74  Not exact but from memory it’s about that, 110 and 120…  I have an at home blood pressure monitor from a brand called Thomson, from what I’ve read it’s not the most reliable. Some of these at home monitors only really give accurate readings on one arm ect ect- I really tried making sure it was in the same place on each arm and I was in the right position with it at heart level but I keep consistently getting different readings in each arm…  I also remembered whenever I have my bloods taken they find it near impossible to find a vein in my left arm so always just go to the right.. I get pain in my left arm like a weird hot cold burn up it, it’s not severe just unusual? I’ve had pins and needles, severe pain, and weakness in it before but after a ECG and all that we concluded it was likely my costochondritis or other shitty fucking muscle problems.   I can’t stop worrying something may seriously be wrong now… I’m trying to remain rational and remind myself I can’t make any assumptions without getting it checked with a reliable blood pressure monitor and with a professional guidance to make sure I am doing it 100% correctly…  I have such bad heart anxiety that I deal with on and off I hate when something comes along to trigger it again….   It’s hard when there are legitimate tangible evidences like blood pressure readings those are so physical and literal..  but like I said I use an at home one that isn’t known to be certified, its possible the arm cuff isn’t fitted to me properly because I am a smaller individual.   I hate running to my doctor everytime I get anxious but is something I legitimately need checked. I’ll probably go for another ‘reason’ then ask if I can compare my readings at home to hers because I keep getting weird readings.

Their responsibilities extend beyond observation; they are often the first to notice subtle changes in a patient’s mood, behavior, or engagement. This hands-on involvement allows the healthcare team to adjust treatment plans quickly and effectively.  In daily practice, MHTs help create a safe, structured environment where patients feel supported. They may lead group activities, encourage participation in therapeutic exercises, or simply listen when a patient needs to talk. For individuals with depression, having consistent and empathetic interaction is essential in reducing feelings of isolation and hopelessness.  MHTs also ensure patients adhere to their treatment plans, such as attending therapy sessions, practicing coping strategies, or taking prescribed medications under supervision. Their ability to build rapport often motivates patients to stay engaged in their recovery journey.  By combining clinical observation with genuine human connection, Mental Health Technicians provide the stability and encouragement depressed patients need.

I came here to share my humble but uplifting journey and I hope yours will end as well as mine!  2023 and 2024 were filled with panic attacks, severe depersonalization and impending doom, I was so miserable all of time, i felt sad, always wanted to cry, felt somehow nostalgic, had terrible intrusive thoughts i couldn't control and I always thought I was seconds away from dying or losing consciousness, it was BAD!  Thankfully, I've used my judgemental personality to good use for once and decided to scrutinize my symptoms and note them to a t. After analyzing them through these episodes of extreme fear, unexplainable sadness and pain, I finally was able to note two things:   A) My stomach was always super acid the day before weeks long panic attack.  B) My head always felt like being squished during the panic attacks.  C) i drank HUGE amount of caffeine through tea, i could down 1L of black tea or Oolong in one go. I drank at least 3L of tea per day, that was insane levels of caffeine!  And thus, instead decided to severely lower my caffeine intake and yet, it didn't work! Weeks passed and these panic attacks were still just as bad and it made me even more scared!  Then, I asked my GP for dexilant, a proton pump inhibitor. What comes next is incredible, i kid you NOT: IT HEALED THE PANIC ATTACKS! MY PANIC ATTACKS WERE CAUSED BY MY IDIOT STOMACH SINCE THE BEGINNING!!!!!  My last panic attack was on September 23 2024, the day before I began taking Dexilant. I took it for like 2 months and since then, I was panic attack free! I have to be careful about diet, I can't eat things that cause GERD but I'm so glad it's over! And yes, being an idiot, I wanted to test my hypothesis and began drinking more tea and eating more spicy, oily and fatty food and, yes: slight panic attacks returned, so i stopped eating GERD causing food once more and the panic attacks never returned.  I hope you, too, can have a good ending.

I was looking for symptoms every day for 7 months, hours a day which exhausted me.  Since then I experienced a plathera of symptoms:  - Cognitive fog like thought blocking, cognitive issues and memory gaps  - some mild to moderate confusion where sometimes i get confused of how to do the basic normal things. It overwhelmed me.  - harm/delusional/bizzare intrusive thoughts and urges along with them: ""ehat if this car is following me"", ""what if I punch this person rn"" etc. I have insight and realise them but they all feel real and give me distress - feel like my common sense and intuition partiality eroded and I feel like I want to do stuff that sometimes don't make sense, like cross a personal boundary or ask someone an inappropriate question. ***for example*** i had a situarion where i sneezed in a bus and for a second for some reason expected a stranger to say ""bless you"" but then i understood it was wrong. Another example is i was watching a movie with my friend and it was getting late. Usually id get the cue for us to end the watch session but lately i started to knowingly, sometimes unknowingly push boundaries and just so he can stay longer and continue watching. again I realise it but it feels partially natural to the point where I legitimately question my sanity.  - scanning for hallucinations (thank God haven't had one). Of course couldn't forget that one  - as said I have harm thoughts and sometimes I'd hear my own voice inside my head that says the thoughts in 2 or 3 words.

I now know that was the sound of my ACL tearing. I struggle with anxiety in my daily life, however, medical situations (doctors offices, hospitals, surgery, needles, etc) are probably my worst trigger. I have a history of fainting -aka vasovagal syncope- and nearly fainted today when my doctor told me my diagnosis. This situation with my knee is causing me a lot of stress and I’m very overwhelmed. I’ve had a pit in my stomach for days just thinking about needing surgery, the recovery, missing work, all of it. I live alone with my boyfriend and our animals, a little over two hours away from my family. Should I have my mom plan to come stay with me the day of my surgery? I feel so alone and unsure. My mind is racing with every question imaginable.  Is there anyone on here who has had this surgery and can offer any insight or words of wisdom?

I (20F) and my bf (20M) have been together for almost 3 years, but im really starting to doubt if this relationship is going to last. To put it simply, I just don't think we're compatible anymore and its really starting to bother me. Like he wants kids and I know for a fact I don't, not mention that I get apprehensive at any mention of marriage to begin with! I get it, I know im only 20 and haven't got my life figured out, but I've been maladaptively daydreaming of something happening that would irreprably break the relationship so I could break up and escape. I tried to just brush it aside since I maladaptively daydream all the time and yes its a bad coping mechanism and I always thought I would get over it and I always did enjoy my time with him. I never thought about it much afterward and would just kind of forget about it, until the cycle restarted. Its only been within the last month that these thoughts really started to hit hard, and its really affecting my mood and how I behave around him! I have to almost fluff up some behaviours of mine just to make him feel like things or normal but its getting harder for me. He hasn't even done anything wrong thats the biggest thing too!!!

We have an assignment to make an advertisement, that will actually be used during school sports events, for an actual business that supports the school.

I sat in class all day both today and yesterday just trying to figure out what to do because I can't send that email. Emails stress me out, but that is a lot less of a problem then the fact I don't feel comfortable reaching out to an actual business to do this. Like, it comes off to me as ""Hiiiii I know you're busy and trying to make money and just trying to do your job but can you go out of your way to humor my high school project."" It feels annoying and rude, which is twisting me up inside just thinking about it.  I really don't know what to do. I'm thinking about asking my teacher for an alternative assignment or asking to be allowed to make an ad for a fake business or just taking a zero even though I know that'll bring my grade down significantly and I won't be able to get higher than a C.

If there truly is a way that I can feel how confident, how unapologetically myself, how much more outspoken and assertive I feel on Prozac naturally, I swear I would do it. I would quit it.  Prozac lowers my inhibitions -- not to the point of recklessness -- but at the same time  makes me careless about certain things that I should care about. I feel the sting of a missed commitment way less than I would have if I weren't on Prozac for example.  On prozac, I am way less driven by impulse to return a wave from a stranger than I would be off Prozac. Off Prozac if someone waved at me, I would instantly wave back to not hurt that person's feeling. On Prozac, yes I still feel the need to wave back, but if I mindfully say NO DONT WAVE BACK just to practice that uncomfortable feeling of minor confrontation, I am way less uncomfortable whereas off Prozac it feels almost impossible and extremely scary. I would almost feel ashamed and guilty for leaving that person hanging. It is almost as if my nerves are much more calmer on Prozac. and I LOVE IT, except the it makes me careless part.      If there is a way for me to naturally produce these awesome effects of Prozac while preserving my concern about certain important things (commitments to people, etc) without being on Prozac, please let me know. I swear I am willing to do anything, ANYTHING it takes to do it because I am beyond fed up.

Basically , my mum is an alcoholic weed smoker who borderline neglected me (bathing me once a week, never teaching me proper cooking/self care skills, getting blackout drunk and passing out, sometimes before events she was meant to be at with me for school) and my dad wasn't there to actually do anything about it.

I lock myself away in my room and don't come out no matter what.  In another setting, I once went to a local town with my friend and we were just walking around looking at shops, but then a group of teenage boys around our age started throwing food at us and shouting at us. Now, I can't go anywhere in that town alone or without a guardian because I'm too scared to, even thinking about it makes me sick. Even when I do go up for shopping or something like that, I very VERY rarely leave the car, and when I do I get super shaky and I'm just constantly on the lookout, like I'm expecting something bad to happen. Even without being in town, this specific group of boys now just totally scares me (roadmen) and whenever I see one or a group of them, I immediately start to have a panic attack and do everything I can to avoid them.

It sucks, because everyone in my life is so dependent on me because of my strength and resilience in the face of insurmountable odds, but fail to recognize that I’m not as strong as they think I am.   I suffer from bipolar disorder, complex regional pain syndrome, hypertension, disability, sleep apnea, insomnia, idiopathic acute pancreatitis, and yet I put on such a positive front that it is infectious, not even my spouse recognizes that I am probably weaker than he is. I’ve tried therapy, yet it only makes me further realize the odds stacked against me and how much my life actually sucks. I’m not suicidal as I feel that on my part, it would be a selfish act. My bipolar is in check as I am not rapid cycling, but my situation feels hopeless and I’ll explain why.   I was born with a football sized arteriovenus malformation and have been taking opioids for pain since I was 13 years old. We finally found a surgeon who could excise it without amputating my leg when I was 21, but as a result of the damage the AVM caused, and in combination with the surgery, I developed CRPS. I now go through very painful nerve blocks each week and use around the clock opioids in an attempt to lessen the pain.   A few years ago, I started using ozempic in an attempt to lose weight so that it would lessen the strain on my leg, and would further reduce the pain and strain on it. Well, about 6 months ago, as a result of my ozempic use, I developed idiopathic acute pancreatitis and I am likely stuck with it for the rest of my life. The last time I had a severe flareup, not even 2mg IV dilaudid every two hours even touched the pain. I don’t cry regarding pain, but that last flare up caused me to cry. It hurt. I was in a program to become an electrician and was working full time prior to that, now I am simply too weak and sick after work to continue that program and was forced to drop out. I can’t stop working, because I need money to support me and my spouse. He works as well, he just doesn’t make enough to support us both.   Then back in 2013, after my brother and I finally reconnected and we were going to meet up. He was proud of his car and wanted to show me it, well a week before we were going to visit him, he got into a tragic car accident in the very same car that brought him such joy. I think in that moment, something just died in me and has not returned since.   It sucks to say, but I feel it’s only downhill from here and I’m just bracing for the next terrible thing to happen. It’s not that I don’t still hope for a positive future, it’s that I no longer dream for one. I’ve felt like this now for over 6 years, yet with every small victory comes a big failure.   Well here is to a better tomorrow, but I doubt there will be a better tomorrow. My health is never going to improve, it can only get worse from here, but I will continue to fake it until I make it! Doubt that I’ll make it, but you never know right?

1npxrds,1758775452,2025-09-25T04:44:12Z,offmychest,Being bad at math is the reason I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"Okay *logically* I know this is a little silly, but hear me out.  I (F20) have been an extremely academic my entire life. I was homeschooled in elementary and middle school and came out the other side highly excelerated in most of my subjects compared to most of my peers. In high school I was thrown a ton of rewards and titles about being smart my way that I didn't realize didn't mean anything at the time, and now as a Junior in college professors and peers compliment on how passionate, analytical, and eloquent I am. I am BY FAR not good at everything (not even close) but in all of my studies and school work there is only one basic academic life skill that I am downright worthless at. Dancing. Just kidding. But not really. It's math.  I don't get it. It doesn't click at all. If you were to ask me a math question that's above a 9th grade level I *will* get it wrong.  I think it started in homeschool when my mom who put the ciriculum together (very well might I add) and was guilding my teaching, also didn't like math and never practiced much of it in her feild even as a nurse. So yes she could walk me through basic concepts but if I had any questions about why I got a certain question wrong it was extremely difficult for her to help me. I remember getting so frustrated, going through my unit for the day and getting every single question wrong.  I switched to public school in 9th grade and was placed with who many other teachers considered to be ""one of the best math teachers in the state"". Still sucked. The class was graded on completion, not accuracy, and there was a crap ton of homework every night. If you finished it you got 5/5 points, but if you finished it and got most questions wrong he gave you a 4.9. Guess which grade I got every week.  I got Cs and Ds on tests but because he dished out 3+ hours of homework every night I guess the homework grade balanced it out, so even though I didn't learn anything I still passed the classes with high Bs. I tried tutoring. Didn't help. The only other help they could offer apart from that was time after class to work on homework that I already didn't know how to do.  COVID hit the end of my Freshman year, and because of that I literally wasn't taught geometry. Like actually. My geometry teacher was the most idiotic, laziest piece of shit teacher I've ever met in all of my 15 years of education and he didn't feel like teaching the class after like halfway through the semester.... I don't really hold not knowing geometry against me lol  Algebra II was when the panic attacks started. When I was 15 I started Algebra II and my teacher was so good at math he made for a lousy teacher. I would get so upset that I didn't understand whatever bullcrap he was trying to teach us that I would have panic attacks almost every day in which I would start crying, screaming, and over all just feeling like the world was ending. (Still during covid, half of these classes were online at home) I remember very specifically sobbing for like 2+ hours one evening because I had like a 79% in Algebra and that was too low of a grade for me, and by some miracle of God I pull myself together enough to finally walk out of the bathroom, look my dad in the eyes and say ""Dad, I don't know what's happening to me, but I feel like I'm dying"". I remember how my Dad looked back at me and for the first time realizing that all of my outbursts weren't just teen angst. There was something wrong. He paused having dinner with my siblings, took me on a walk, and scheduled me an appointment with my doctor the next day. As it turns out, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and have likely had it since I was 11. I've been treated for it ever since and it's all because I was bad at math.  My Dad pulled me out of that class so I could emotionally recover and for the following 9 months the thought of a math question would make me sweaty and sick to my stomach. When I started my junior year I was *finally* able to find a math teacher that could teach me math. Kinda at least. I survived the class.  Flash forward four years and I haven't had to do any math at all until now. I'm required to do this stupid Reasoning class that's basically just to make sure they're not passing any 22 year olds that don't know what an exponent is I guess. Thankfully my anxiety has been in check so I have not felt like I'm going to die or the world is ending. I go into the class with a good attitude, ready to learn and work hard. Nope. Still can't do math. I understand concepts just fine but in execution I will always make at least one silly mistake.  What is wrong with me? I genuienly feel like I might have a learning disability. It's like numbers don't ""fit"" in my head. I've got to be the only person in the world who was so bad at math I had to start taking anxiety meds because of it.  It doesn't help that my boyfriend is a math wiz and the best person I know at math. He makes it look so easy.  What is WRONG with me?  PS thankfully the career I'm going into does not require any math outside very basic algebra that I can do",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npxrds/being_bad_at_math_is_the_reason_i_was_diagnosed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npxrds/being_bad_at_math_is_the_reason_i_was_diagnosed/

I could make it to my sports practices only some days, and only if I binge ate so much I felt sick.  I lied to my parents about the reason why in coming home. I told them it’s because my school scheduled my exams for the same days as my national sports competitions, but it’s actually because I literally have not attended any class and will fail unless I take a leave of absence and drop before Oct 6.

Being able to accept their bodies and share that positivity for other people to see that they can also feel good about themselves is a great thing!  On one hand, some people have little or no control over their weight because of health conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Hypothyroidism, Prader Willi Syndrome, Menopause, kidney diseases, etc. Or because of certain medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics, diabetes medications, etc.   On the other hand, if someone struggles with binge eating disorder, or eat excessively due to depression, anxiety, adhd, etc. Then hating their body makes this struggle worse so they keep overeating.  Being fat is not going to become the new beauty standard, people are not going to start gaining weight to the point of obesity because they saw a happy fat person on instagram. It's ridiculous to pretend this is a threat in any way.  Yes it's not healthy to be overweight or obese, we all know that. But neither is bullying people online telling them to ""go to the gym"", making fun of them, to ""stop glorifying obesity"" just because they exist. People who do that justify being assholes to these people because they ""care about health"", but that's bullshit, otherwise they'd say the same to people who posts pictures with alcohol or drugs. But it's always towards fat people. Just let them be happy, you don't even have to like them, just mind your own business. You have no idea if they're doing their best to lose weight, if anything being comfortable and accepting of themselves is a great step, people who practice self love are more likely to take better care of themselves.  And if someone doesn't want to lose weight or has no interest in taking care of their health, then that's their problem, it's not going to affect you.",64,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npyop6/fat_people_posting_pictures_where_they_look/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npyop6/fat_people_posting_pictures_where_they_look/

However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it.   Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing.

This is the story of my life over the past three or so years.     At 23, After having suffered some losses (death of a friend, a breakup, unfulfilling experience in college due to COVID lockdowns), I decided to start my life anew by moving to a new city for a volunteer service position. This was a huge risk for me, I've never done anything like this before. I was incredibly nervous; I carried a lot of anxiety, low esteem, and negativity with me into this experience, Despite knowing that it would be difficult to manage, I decided to take a chance on it. It was a journey full of successes and failures, but by the end, it turned out to be an experience I cherish dearly. I helped many of the people I worked with. I learned so much through the work I did. I grew more and more confident thanks to my accomplishments and failures. I made lots of friends, some of whom were the kindest souls I’ve ever met. I found a sense of belonging in a city that allowed me to express myself. I accepted more of myself (the good and bad). I eventually felt content and comfortable with being single. I felt proud and accomplished.  I felt so connected with my sense of self.  However, in the midst of my service year, I was given the offer to move abroad to Japan after my service year had concluded. I’ve always wanted to go to Japan, it’s been a dream of mine for years. Given how much I accomplished and how much I grew throughout my service year, I felt that I was ready to take a chance and move abroad, but I hesitated because I grew very attached to my new home. It would hurt a lot to move away, it felt like I was leaving behind a place that I could truly call home. But my friends encouraged me to take advantage of this opportunity. They had a lot of faith in me and my abilities. It felt like a once in a lifetime opportunity that I couldn't pass up. It was the most difficult decision of my life, but I decided to accept the offer and leave for Japan.   About a month after my service term ended, I hopped on a plane to Japan and started anew, again. Despite being terrified about the challenges that lied ahead, I remember feeling so much excitement about the move. I cherished the memories and growth I had cultivated from my previous experience, and used the excitement and open-mindedness that I had attained during that previous experience in my new experience. As a result, the first few months here were truly special. Although I stumbled through a lot of the experiences early on, my strong sense of self was able to reassure me with self compassion and patience. I met a lot of people. I had a lot of unforgettable experiences. I surprised myself with some of the things I was able to accomplish. I even met someone while I was here, and began a fun relationship with them. Looking back on it, I really did accomplish the life and dream that I wanted.   I was living the dream, but I did not feel that I was living up to who I wanted to be. Somewhere along the way, as I felt the mounting pressure build up, as I felt that I was not growing at the speed I 'should have' been growing at, as culture shock started to set in, as I started to feel homesickness and regret over my decision to leave my previous life behind, my internal self beliefs and emotions began to spiral out of control. The inner parts of me that made up my low self esteem began to take over like before, but I didn’t have the same support network I once had to counteract the negativity. My girlfriend at the time provided me with support and comfort, but the trauma from my previous relationship had left me feeling very numb and hesitant to connect deeply in my new relationship. I also did not feel that I belonged in my new friend groups or at work. In my everyday life, I counted the amount of disappointments and mistakes in my life while consciously ignoring or downplaying the successes, and replayed those disappointing moments over and over again in my head. My sense of self began to give way to other parts within me, parts that were highly self critical and emotionally unstable. I couldn’t be kind to myself anymore. I became despondent and helpless over every aspect of myself. I’d emotionally shutdown around my friends, my mind would create narratives that everyone around me thought less of me. I kept blaming myself for being too anxious, or for not putting in the right amount of effort, etc.  ""You're not doing enough"", ""you're too needy/dependent"", ""you're too selfish"", ""you're avoiding opportunities again"", ""everyone is justified in thinking less of you"", ""you don't deserve her affection/love"", ""you're doing the bare minimum, don't indulge in the praise/positivity directed towards you"". These are the things that the self critical part of me would repeat over and over.  The cruelty I subjected myself to soon began to affect others. I started expressing apathy towards the people around me, including my girlfriend at the time. I started to put up distance between me and other people. I started to disregard my feelings and the feelings of others. I’d say offensive things, and eventually, do offensive things. Not before long, I would end up destroying the trust my girlfriend and had given me, and would fail to tell her the truth about what I had done when we eventually broke up.   Cut to the present. I have been living in Japan for a year now, and have committed to another year. My girlfriend and I have been broken up for several months now. I hold a lot of regret over how I squandered such a lovely relationship and failed to stay true to my self (tell the truth). My situation at work is miserable: I'm terrified of interacting with just about everyone, and I’m treated like a social pariah who no one can comfortably communicate with (due to the language barrier, and my stand-offish demeanor). I ghosted several of my friends back home, and they hate me now for it. I’ve treated some of my friends here very poorly by violating their trust. I have failed so many people.   I’ve hurt my friends. I’ve been a bad partner to my ex. I lied. I cheated. I gossiped. I projected my own insecurities. I ruminated too much. I disassociated. I let my emotions control me. I’ve been too ungrateful. I’ve been kicking myself this entire time in order to prevent me from becoming what I fear most, but I’ve unfortunately allowed it to happen. I feel broken. I feel trapped. I feel helpless. I feel like an awful person. I’ve sabotaged my own happiness and success.   Despite how hopeless this all feels, I can feel myself still inside here. My sense of ‘self’ still exists, and it wants to pull me out of this. My sense of self wants to set things right, it wants to tell the truth, it wants to practice self compassion. But is that the right thing to do? Telling the truth to my ex and setting things right will destroy all of my friendships and relationships here. But it also feels wrong to practice self compassion; why would I want to be compassionate towards someone who has lied to and hurt others? I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel comfortable being myself. I’m scared of what I might do next. I’m scared that I’m going to continue to hurt others, but I’m also scared that my emotions and beliefs will continue to hurt me. I’ve been hurting really bad for so long.   I want to be understood, but I also want to understand others. I need help, but I also want to help others. I want to accept and process my emotions in a healthy manner, but I also want to help others process their emotions. I want to express myself, but I also want to encourage others to express themselves. I want to be happy, but I also want to make others happy. I want to feel connected to others. I want to feel like myself again.   There’s only a few reasons I’m still holding onto any semblance of hope. I'm hoping that I won’t wrong the few friends I still have; I want them to feel cherished. I'm hoping that the work I’m doing with my current therapist (who is so wonderful and so helpful) will lead me closer to self acceptance. I'm hoping that I can transform my current predicament into something that will bring me and others happiness. But most of all, I hold hope that my sense of self will return one day. I really miss him. I really need him right now.   I wanted to share this because I want someone here to understand me. I want to be heard. Somebody, please give me words of encouragement. I want to finally feel some kind of catharsis. It's been too long.   If you've made it to the end, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1npz20k/ive_let_a_lot_of_people_down_including_myself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1npz20k/ive_let_a_lot_of_people_down_including_myself/
1npz2wr,1758780284,2025-09-25T06:04:44Z,mentalhealth,"I am 19 years old man, and I was recently diagnosed with depressive-anxious disorder and complex personality traits. Right now, I feel very confused and I don’t know what to do.","English is not my first language.  One month ago, I went to a new psychologist after a night when I realized that the thought of disappearing — which had already been recurring for a while — no longer made me feel any discomfort. At that moment, I remembered that I hadn’t been bothered by that thought for a long time. This realization scared me, so I made an appointment with the psychologist.  Three weeks ago, I had another session. The following week, I had one scheduled, but I didn’t want to go, so I skipped it. After that, I spent a week in my hometown with my family because I had a week off from university.  I’m confused because I know, intellectually, that these thoughts are wrong — but I don’t feel that way. I’ve had some of these thoughts since I was 12, and even traces of them before that. So it feels like they’ve always been there. I grew up with them, so they don’t feel wrong to me.  I feel so dumb and embarrassed when I try to talk about my thoughts and emotions.  The psychologist had me take six tests: two for depression, two for anxiety, and two for personality disorders, and I feel unsure if those tests are enough. The results showed major depression, moderate anxiety, and personality traits slightly above the healthy range or normal range, I don’t know.  The psychologist wants me to take medication prescribed by a psychiatrist, but I don’t feel comfortable with that. He only had me take tests for all of that, and I feel unsure if those tests are enough, and I don’t know how I will feel after taking the medication. I know it’s meant to help the chemical balance in my brain, but I feel insecure about the idea of losing control over my moods.  So, I’m lost. Is this the normal process with a psychologist? For those who take medication, what has your experience been? How do I separate my thoughts and emotions from those I grew up with? How can I recognize which thoughts are harmful? How do I commit to treatment? How can I feel validated that these thoughts are actually wrong? Is there any way to stop feeling stupid when I talk about them — or to stop thinking that someone with my life experience shouldn’t feel this bad? I know I haven’t had a perfect life, but I also recognize that I haven’t lacked material things either. And can anyone explain to me what complex personality means?

1npz5ds,1758780545,2025-09-25T06:09:05Z,offmychest,I Don't know what's happening to me,"I will get to the point right away. I have always worked alone and never wanted friends or family attention. I never enjoyed functions, farewells, or social gatherings. The only thing I ever wanted was knowledge. For a long time, everything seemed like it was going well — I was preparing to go abroad for higher studies. But then, suddenly, my mind started asking questions about love, and that’s where my downfall began.  I started remembering my school days. When I was around 13, I was overweight and people used to call me “white fat boy” in English translation. Nobody wanted me to sit with them, but there was one girl who treated me differently. She never insulted me, always helped me, and I really liked her company. I felt attached to her, but I never expressed my feelings, because I was scared of losing my only friend. In fact, from that day until now, I have had no friends. When school ended, I left without even saying goodbye to her. Now, at 21, those memories have returned. I sometimes think about finding her again, but I fear I will look like a freak.  What triggered these thoughts again was anime. I spend a lot of time watching anime as an escape. Recently, the character Momo from Dandadan reminded me of that girl from school — her personality, her kindness, and the way she made me feel less alone. It was like reliving those memories, and it made me realize how deeply I still carry that attachment. While anime comforts me, it also makes me long for connections I don’t have in real life, which sometimes worsens my loneliness and even leads to panic attacks.  I am lonely now, and although I try to accept that, my mind keeps telling me that unless I find someone like her, I will never be at peace. I live in Kashmir, where people are beautiful in appearance, but when it comes to relationships, there is emptiness. I saw this even in my brother’s marriage — things looked fine before, but after marriage problems began and everything changed. That makes me afraid the same fate could happen to me.  Another thing that makes it worse is family and relatives. I look good on the outside, and because of that, they constantly assume I must have a girlfriend. On every occasion they ask me, “When are we going to meet her?” This makes me feel pressured, misunderstood, and even more isolated, because the reality is I don’t have anyone.  The hardest part is that I really don’t have anyone to share these feelings with. So I keep everything inside, which makes me feel even more alone. Overall, I feel stuck. I don’t know whether my problem is my past, my loneliness, my future, or the pressure of relationships. I feel like my life is filled with confusion, emptiness, and overthinking, and sometimes the emotional pain becomes unbearable. I am worried that I may have depression or possibly bipolar disorder, and I would like your professional opinion.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npz5ds/i_dont_know_whats_happening_to_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1npz5ds/i_dont_know_whats_happening_to_me/

When my last girlfriend and I were breaking up, she came over to talk some. It had already been ugly up to that point but while we were eating, she admitted that she slept with someone immediately after we broke up. At this point I went into the bathroom and threw up. I lost weight because the entire breakup experience made it difficult for me to eat for a couple months.  She called me wanting to reconcile a month ago (she ended up changing her mind but that’s besides the point). I went to hear her out and the second I saw her I felt nauseous again. Almost so much so that I could have thrown up. I held it back and after a few minutes I felt normal. I assumed that this was specific to this particular ex.  The other night I was out on a date with a very nice, very pretty girl. Halfway through, I had to stop eating my burger because the excitement I was feeling about this person was starting to make me feel nauseous again.  Just tonight, I exchanging some flirty and explicit texts with a girl on a dating app while I ate dinner, and even THAT started to get to me.

I constantly checked how I felt and any small sensation of my body caused panic. But Wednesday was the worst. I couldn't get my mind off of it and it was hard to breathe. When I also woke up on Wednesday I had only slept for 3 hours, my heart was racing and pouding and I feel scared. The first thing that went to my mind was ""Did I die"". I then went to school and I couldn't get rid of the feeling. I fell asleep after I got home but it was a short sleep, shout 2 hours then accompanied by fear. Then during 12am-5am was probably the worst I ever felt. My chest felt tight and I couldn't sleep no matter what. Nothing was taking my mind off of how I felt. Then I started feeling sleepy around 5:30 but this is how it went. Part 1 I started to fall asleep but quickly jolted in pain as it felt like my heart stopped. Part 2 I was at the edge of falling asleep but then again it felt like my heart stopped. Part 3 at the edge again and I quickly jolted as I felt like I was falling when I was about to fall asleep. Part 4 I waited till 6:30 then I finally fell asleep for 5 hours. But when I woke up I felt extremely scared. Around 3 hours after I woke up I fell asleep again. Around 1 hour later I woke up feeling extreme fear. If anyone can tell me that what I'm feeling isn't crazy or that I'm not going crazy that would be very much appreciated. I also need some help or tips that can help me get through this. It's really been affecting me a lot.

I wish there was a more mature or professional term to define this. Wouldn’t be surprised if there was but even if there is, I don’t know what it’s called.  It’s due to my mental health and natural personality but as we all know, social butterfly’s are also the most loneliest people ever. For anyone that doesn’t know what this is, it’s person that doesn’t have any close friends but friends everywhere. I hate it.  A few years ago a friend of mine confessed she was actually into me but, when we were out at a party she could see that I was saying hi to all these other friends everywhere and could tell that I’m just not one to stick to one small group of friends.  How do I get out of this? Do I even want to get out of this? I always figured it was great that I seem to have so many friends everywhere and everyone always tells me that it’s a true privilege. But how it it? I see them constantly coupled up in relationships or even really close friends that they’ve known for decades and I’d love to get that but how? When I go out, I always find all the people around me to be amazing.

As a teenager, I didn't take university seriously, had a lot of mental health-challenges and dropped out. I am now in my early thirties, always had very poor mental health and been very unhappy, been institutionalized and what has always lingered is this regret that I didn't prove myself academically. In highschool, I was a straight A-student, never had to study that much, I could ace tests I barely did anything for.   Now here I am, I have a degree, but it's something that basically anyone could do. I have fallen on hard times and wanted to go back to college to get a serious job worth respecting. I needed financial support for that, but nobody in my family thought it was a good idea. On top of that, due to traumatic events, my mental health and focus is really poor. I probably wouldn't be able to handle large syllabi anymore.   Coming to terms and being honest that I'm not who I used to be: an overachiever who could study fine and took a lot of pride in my intelligence, I am feeling so defeated. I am enrolled in evening classes. It is something I have an interest in, but it's not something I can do something with professionally. It breaks my heart, because I would have loved to study this in college and prove myself, but I am just not good enough. I don't judge others over not having a degree, but I judge myself a lot and feel like a loser. People had such high expectations for me, which adds to the shame. I am mentally weak, not in terms of brains, but my attitude and depressive state. I am not a motivated person. I am just burnt-out. I lie to people I respect about having a college degree, because I don't want to feel judged.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq15ge/i_feel_terrible_about_not_having_a_college_degree/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq15ge/i_feel_terrible_about_not_having_a_college_degree/
1nq15yo,1758788454,2025-09-25T08:20:54Z,offmychest,"Epileptic roommate clashes with hygiene, what to do?","I apologise in advance for my grammar mistakes, but please bear in mind that English is not my mother tongue. This is going to be a long post, and I am not sure if I'm just venting or asking for an advice.  I(36F) live in a 3-bedroom flat with my wife(30F) and another flatmate(28F). I've been living there with this third girl and another flatmate before dating and marrying my wife; she(my wife) moved in around a year ago. My wife is currently waiting for her visa to be processed in order to then look for legal work, and I have decided to go back to school to change my work field. Before that, I knew that this would be my plan and I chose to keep this flat because it is relatively cheaper on an unemployed person's budget. Bottom line is, neither of us have a work contract and where we live, it is mandatory in order to apply for a rental. We don't want to risk it with illegal rentals.  This third girl is simply hard to share a flat with. I now bring myself down for not moving out when I used to have a work contract before starting this training that I am in, because it simply grinds my gears. I will also add that she is epileptic from birth so some behaviour patterns might be because of low mental health, so I tried to be understanding. When I used to work, I was spending long hours out of the shared flat so I guess I simply didn't notice them as much.  Cleanliness and hygiene represent a big chunk of what I have to talk about. As we share the flat and we are all on a budget, we clean the shared spaces ourselves. I noticed that she is not as particular about making sure she cleaned everything when it is her turn to clean the bathroom, for instance (like forgetting to clean the floor, misplacing our stuff on the counter). No biggie, I would either tell her or do it better myself when it was my turn. Just that it became a habit. We tried talking to her, she agreed to be more careful, but then she forgot and got back to her old habit after a few weeks.   She is also very talkative, she's like one of those people that talk a lot without saying much. And the problem is, she talks very fast, doesn't let you finish what you would have to say, and follows you around the flat to keep talking at you. The other flatmate I used to have and I, we simply don't have the same character, so sometimes we just needed silence, and we realised we had to shut ourselves in our room for that. Again, we addressed this, she said she was fine, but she didn't really apply what we agreed.  My then other flatmate left as she had enough, which prompted the owner to bring an older man (in his 50s) as a flatmate because he could not find anyone else, saying it's for 2-3 weeks. I agreed only because it would be for a short stay. The guy ended up staying for a few months, and at one point I wanted to point it out to the owner because it was not what we agreed. The girl flatmate said she would write a similar message because she had the same feeling. I went ahead and wrote what I had to say to the owner, and when I asked her for updates she said she decided not to say anything anymore, because her mom advised not to, saying that the guy didn't actually do anything. I was enraged because maybe if the owner saw that the guy being there is bothering both of us, he would take it more seriously. The guy was not cleaning anything around the flat, was smoking, watching tv very loud, and best of all, snoring his guts out every night, which made it hard to sleep because I could hear him loud and clear. I already was on unemployment, so luckily I could catch up on sleep during the day, but also it meant that I could not move out, so I felt super stuck.  After like 5 months he ended up leaving by himself (hooray) and that's when my then-fiancée, now wife moved in. She noticed a lot of times the flatmate is simply not cleaning well after herself, and as we spend more time at home, we end up cleaning more often because we have the availability. Examples of what she does (proceed at your own disgust):   She spends a lot of time sitting on the toilet, and then leaves a huge stink after leaving. I don't know if it's because of her health issue or the meds she takes, but it's quite disturbing as the toilet is separated from the rest of the bathroom and we have only one of each. This is how flats are built around here, so when sharing a flat with someone that hogs the bathroom for 30-40 even 50 minutes you end up needing to just go pee somewhere - we end up going in the shower.   Bonus point, when she leaves the toilet after having grown roots in there, if the bathroom is not free she just goes and washes the poop of her hands in the kitchen sink, even if there are dishes in there. It is quite frustrating because, as it turns out, we had to use the shower to pee, so we would occupy it specifically because of her being in the toilet for so long.  I also noticed a few times she doesn't properly clean the toilet after using, and I talked to her about it, although I'm super uncomfortable, she apologised and said she will pay more attention, but like with other things, it just keeps happening again every once in a while.  She very loudly blows her nose every time in the shower, we don't need to pay attention to hear it, and it makes me think that her boogers might go everywhere on the shower cabin.   While cleaning the bathroom, she once washed the toilet brush cup and she brought it to the kitchen to place it on the dish drying rack. Luckily I was in the kitchen and I told her absolutely not to do that. Similarly, one day when I came back home, I found her washing the fridge shelves in the shower cabin, and I told her she should not. It makes me horrified of what she might be doing when we are not home to interfere.  On another day, she said she would clean the living room, because she hadn't participated in cleaning in a few weeks. I saw her dusting off the surfaces, and then my wife and I went out to do grocieries or whatever. We came back home and we realised she didn't clean anymore after we had left. We found it very disrespectful, but we didn't say anything; we decided to simply give her the silent treatment, as talking seems to be like her favorite activity, so not having a conversation partner seems like a fitting response.  I can tell that she does not have a lot of friends and not much going on in her life, and sometimes I feel pity for her. The fact that her own mom stood up for the guy that overstayed his welcome with us  rather than her really opened my eyes to how little support she must receive from her family. I know she goes to therapy to undo years of not getting the assistance she needed as a child. But I also know that she sees immigrants (bonus, my wife and I are immigrants) as the source of downfall in her country, and probably she sees us as inferior to her because of not being nationals. Would that justify the fact that she basically lets us clean her filth?  My wife and I's situation will improve in a few months and we will move out. Should we try and talk to her about these issues that we see? I fear that she will simply forget and get back to how she is in a matter of weeks. Should we be understanding as they could be an effect of her mental health? I find her behaviour disturbing and outrageous, and I don't think she should share a flat with people, but then again she is not the one bothered by sharing, it is us.   Thank you for reading this far, I sure needed to let it out.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq15yo/epileptic_roommate_clashes_with_hygiene_what_to_do/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq15yo/epileptic_roommate_clashes_with_hygiene_what_to_do/
1nq16j3,1758788514,2025-09-25T08:21:54Z,mentalhealth,Is this PTSD,"Because of the perfectionism I suffer from while studying, my academic performance has declined. I would stay for many hours and not finish any task, especially on exam days — I would get anxious when the sun set or when the thought came that I must stay up late even though I still hadn’t finished studying for my exam, and sometimes the exam would be the next day.  I stayed like this for a very long time, about ten years.  Now, at university, when the clock strikes 9 p.m. I start to experience symptoms like heaviness and tightness in my chest, intense anxiety, a desire to cry, wanting to hug someone, and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness even though I’m with my family and sometimes I don’t even have an exam. I feel generally uncomfortable and I can’t concentrate because of the chest tightness, so I escape to social media to browse. I can’t study anything while those disgusting feelings are present, especially my feeling of loneliness, and I literally have to go through this every day. The problem is I can’t bear these dark feelings any longer. There isn’t a really good psychiatrist in my city — they’re all awful — and I can’t get an online consultation right now.  My question here: is there anyone with a condition like mine or who has gone through this experience? Is this PTSD? Because every time I don’t finish studying the exam material I feel extreme distress, terror, get bad grades, and fear criticism and embarrassment after the exam.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq16j3/is_this_ptsd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq16j3/is_this_ptsd/

1nq1d9v,1758789275,2025-09-25T08:34:35Z,mentalhealth,I'm a pathological liar and can't trust my own thoughts anymore.,"Before I tell what happened, a bit of background about me: I have diagnosed ADHD, ASD, anxiety disorder and depression. I also have un/selfdiagnosed dpdr intrusive thoughts and the reason for my current state of mind: I recently came to realize that I'm a pathological liar. I live in Germany, finding a therapist here is hard. I can't afford one out of insurance.  Over the last 3 weeks I made over 250 calls to over 80 therapists. I have an appointment for an assessment in about 2 weeks.  I want to understand what's wrong with my brain, I want to work on myself, I want to change and stop the behavior that causes me to self destruct and hurt my friends.  So, here's what happened 2 days ago:  My partner who I want to move in with on the upcoming weekend asked for some time and space for themselves. Due to my anxiety it took me way too long (over a week) to accept that. My partner mostly stopped responding to my messages. On Tuesday I got a call from my doc that my prescription wasn't picked up. My partner was supposed to do that during their appointment. So I left work immediately to make it to the doctor's office and on the way I called my partner to ask what happened and if I should pick up their prescription too. They apparently thought the appointment was a day later and they were still on a train back here from a trip they took. I picked up both our prescriptions and later my partner called again. They were trying to make smalltalk, but the harsh cut in communication over the last few weeks caused some unwarranted resentment to build up within me, so I tried to keep some emotional distance until that wore off. Later that day my partner send me their arrival time at our train station without any context. I answered ""I won't pick you up"" mostly because I was under the impression that they'll still stay with my best friend, but also because I still wasn't feeling ready to talk in person. They answered with ""I wasn't implying that"" I then called my best friend for something unrelated, but we talked about that, and I realized that the message to my partner was hurtful and they definitely wanted to be picked up by me. So I texted my partner, asking if they actually did imply that.  I don't really understand what happened in my brain next, this is put together from what my partner and best friend told me, as well as my own memories. My best friend told me during the call that the stress of the situation between my partner and I caused them a lack of sleep, I said that I didn't get much sleep lately either and we joked about how we might lose our jobs because of it. But in that moment, my brain decided for some reason to only make the ""were about to lose our jobs"" part available to me (I only remember the rest of the communication because I was told about it later)  So I messaged my partner, telling them that I should pick them up because my best friend is about to lose their job bc of the whole situation. My partner answered with something along the lines of ""do you think I'm stupid, why are you lying, do you think we don't talk?"" I tried to find them at the train station, but didn't, so I went to my best friends place to talk to them. When I arrived there, we talked for about 2h in which they told and proved to me that I'm a pathological liar.  Now I'm completely overwhelmed by every thought, stuck in an endless cycle of ""is the thought im currently thinking real or does my brain just make that up""",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq1d9v/im_a_pathological_liar_and_cant_trust_my_own/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq1d9v/im_a_pathological_liar_and_cant_trust_my_own/

Due to my age it’s costing me £500, and that alone has crippled me for the next few months as it’s wiped my savings and eaten into bills money. That alone caused me a lot of stress but I tried to get on with life.  The insurance company have given me a courtesy car, but as it was a Friday and they don’t work on weekends my mum rushed me to collect it. This greatly upset me and I was a nervous wreck driving the 15 minutes back.   On Monday I had to pick my brother up from school but I couldn’t get in the drivers seat without having an anxiety attack.   My mum was confused and slightly annoyed by this response. She’s of the opinion that since it was a small accident that hardly did much damage I shouldn’t be having such an extreme response.   I’m usually a really confident driver and my bodies response to the accident is pissing me off since it’s affected so much already.   Almost every waking thought is going over the accident, I’m not sleeping right, I’m struggling to eat and Ive slipped back into a really bad depressive episode.   What’s upsetting me more is how my mum is trying to force me back to driving. I know it’s like getting off a bike but I’m terrified.  What if next time I’m in an accident it’s worse and people get hurt? I had a passenger with me at the time so I’m even more scared that I’ll hurt those I care about.   But whenever I try and talk to my mum she claims she’s not annoyed but her language, actions and face tell me otherwise. It’s clear she’s angry at my over this stupid reaction.   I don’t know what to do, my family rely on me a lot for transportation and now Im not even good enough for that.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq21d1/im_having_anxiety_attacks_about_driving_after_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq21d1/im_having_anxiety_attacks_about_driving_after_a/

1nq2khq,1758794019,2025-09-25T09:53:39Z,offmychest,Life feels like it hates me,"(TL;DR) Life feels like it hates me. How do you keep going even if life throws one obstacle after the other into your way? I know life aint easy and there will be ups and downs. But I feel like while some people have a mild inconvenience every once in a while, other people get life altering tests of character back to back without rest.   2007 started my apprenticeship as a wholesaler, had really great grades which led to me being invited to leadership training to set me up for a good position after my exams. Two weeks before my exams I got fired because I allegedly stole money out of the register. Turns out my boss was afraid that I might replace him because the company was restructuring and a few old leaders already got replaced by younger colleagues.   2009  started my second apprenticeship. This time as an electrician because there's money in the trades.   2010 My parents decided to get a divorce, while they fought it out over my back they simultaneously demanded to keep everything hidden from my little brother to protect his grades. My dad moved out and under tears told me that my mom left him with nothing so he's going to move back in with my grandma (his mom) because the house needs some renovation and rework my dad was broke. So the good son i am took out a loan for him (he couldn't at that point because he was still tied to the loan he had with my mom) Well 2 weeks after i handed him the money he turned up with a brand new pickup truck because „we cost him so much now is this time to live“ (no more contact since that day)   2014 As soon as i finished my exams my boss sends me working all over europe sometimes for 4-6 weeks at a time. One night after 6 weeks of doing a 12+ hour shift and sleeping in bunk beds somewhere in rural Bulgaria I returned home. I had a ring in my pocket and planned to propose to my then GF of 6 years. Open the flat door and everything is gone. My clothes were lying on a pile in the bedroom. She took everything, cleaned the shared account and moved in with her new BF because „she felt left alone by me working so much“ (I worked so much to pay for her school)   2016 Was sick of the permanent fights with my family, met someone and moved out into the big city    2018 Life felt like I finally found some upwind. Decided to apply for an apprenticeship as a firefighter (been doing it voluntarily for 10 years at this point) Applied, got invited, nailed the interview, nailed the written test, sport test 4 weeks out was well in shape and confident to ace that too.  1 week out was doing a gym session, doing back squats and some idiot wasn't paying attention came around the squat corner and knocked the bar of my shoulder (130kg) needless to say o collapsed under the bar, cracked one vertebrae, herniated 2 discs and dislocated my shoulder. There was my dream of being a firefighter down the drain as well as working construction anymore. So there I was unemployed and physically disabled.  As soon as there was no more money coming in my GF shifted and didn't want to support me and found a better guy. No job meant no money meant me not being able to pay my debts. Which leads to a whole nother bag of problems. Which finally ending with me filing for private bankruptcy (45.000€ in debt still paying ex gf and her new bf furniture and dads truck)  2019 Spend all my remaining money on doctors and therapy hoping to fix my back. Nothing worked so I underwent surgery. Went great 89 weeks later and was even able to work again although I had to hand over most of my money because of the bankruptcy. I was back at work for 4 months when I was hit by a cyclist who wasn't paying attention. I fell which led to my back flaring up again. Had to undergo a second surgery late 2019   2020 At this point I was a mess mentally and decided to go into therapy. Went into therapy got diagnosed with adhd (which explained a lot of my past) Came out of therapy, motivated and hopeful. Since I was going to become a dad I applied for a program to get another degree since construction was out of the question and I wanted to build a life/career to give my son what I never had and set him up good for life.  2021 got accepted into the program and moved in with my then GF. My son was born and it felt like everything was finally falling into place  2024 Finished the program as a certified construction draftsman. I immediately found a job which at this point I thought was perfect and had everything I wanted from a job.  2025 Over the last 4 years there came more and more strain into the relationship. She had to compensate financially because i didnt get that much support while doing my certification.  She also felt like she missed out/wasn't where she wanted to be because the whole focus was on me.  Spring 2024 I get laid off without any warning. Didnt find a new job as fast as i wanted.   She decided she didn't want to support me anymore. So she broke up and I had to move out.   And those are just the big events where each one came with its own bag of problems. And the ratstail that followed the problems problems.  Now I have moved out sitting here in my empty tiny flat 3 degrees not a cent to my name (but at least almost debt free) I’m out of shape and gained 20kg.  My liver numbers are of the charts because I spend the last few weeks binge eating BK and downing a bottle of whiskey every other day (Stopped doing that now)  Although we have shared custody and my son is with me every other week, I miss him, I miss her and I  miss the family we had.  To be honest im not sure If i´d even be typing this i fit werent form my son.  It's not like I don't like life. But I'm tired of falling down and getting back up again.  I find it harder and harder to find a silver lining and keep going.  Redditors that also feel like they got fuddled over by life again and again, Did it get better? Where are you today?

And then I tried this one simple technique that actually made a difference.  Whenever the anxiety kicks in, I pause and imagine my best friend coming to me with the exact same fear. Then I ask “What would I say to them right now?”  It sounds simple, but it’s kind of magical. The anxious voice in my head softens. Instead of piling on more worry, I end up saying things like- “It’s okay to feel nervous” or “You’ve gotten through tougher moments before.”  The cool part? It feels less like I’m trying to “fix” my anxiety and more like I’m giving myself a warm hug through words. A little reset button for my nervous system.  There’s even a whole exercise around this called “Be your Friend” it’s about practicing self-compassion instead of self-criticism. Honestly, it’s way kinder than trying to fight anxiety with pure logic.  How do you usually talk to yourself when anxiety shows up?",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq30wk/anxiety_hack_be_your_own_best_friend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq30wk/anxiety_hack_be_your_own_best_friend/
1nq325o,1758795826,2025-09-25T10:23:46Z,offmychest,Struggling through life,"I’m up at 5 AM because I slept all day somehow. I’m on leave from work because I had surgery a month ago. I’m depressed. I go to therapy but talk therapy isn’t working. I’m really struggling. I can’t explain this feeling to anyone. The people around me don’t understand. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t see any value in living. Sometimes I do but I always end up right back here. I’m blessed to have shelter, a job, a man that loves me, and food everyday but I’m unhappy. People want me to appreciate what I have in front of me but it’s not enough.  They want me to stop complaining. They want me to “trust God’s plan”. At some point I did but I don’t believe in that anymore. My job doesn’t pay enough and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I’m in debt. My account is currently over a hundred dollars negative because I’m on STD but yet to receive a payment & even when I do, it won’t be enough for rent at the end of the week. I don’t have any family support. My boyfriend supports me as much as he can, but he has his own financial difficulties. I hate my job and my life. Even myself sometimes because of ADHD and struggling with executive functioning. I hate that I’m this way and wish I was different. I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs over the past 4 years and have gotten no where. All rejections, and that’s my fault because I got an English degree in college. I’m unhirable and I fucked up. I am a writer and tried to pivot to creating my own web series. I’m failing at that too. I’m 28 and I know I’m not a complete failure. However, when you aren’t “winning” at life and have been dealt a bad hand, it looks a lot like failure. I don’t want to seem like I’m ungrateful about what I do have in life. I just needed to get this off my chest. I know I’m depressed but I’m not sure how to get out of it. I’m not sure how to change my life. Changing your life seems to involve money and I don’t have that. Idk what to do anymore. I use to be an optimistic person who always believed every problem has a solution but what happens when you’ve run out of solutions. Does life get better? Truly. Will there be a point where I’m no longer in survival mode or staying up all night crying, hoping, praying for relief? Idk what I’m looking for. I just needed to get that off my chest and Reddit is a place I come too sometimes to read about other people. I’ve never posted in this forum but I opened the app and it was the first thing I saw.

My tongue feels tingly or sharp pains in almost any part of my body. So many things that I never experienced before or at least I can’t remember if I did. I always ask my sister or my boyfriend if they ever experience these sensations and the response is always “maybe” or “no”. If that’s the case am I really just that hyper focused on any new sensation going on within my body? It’s so exhausting. I want to get better and there are moments of ease but it’s like it never fully lets up. I’m terrified of medication as well. I started lexapro a couple of years ago when things got bad and it literally felt like I was coming down from acid (HORRIBLE). I guess what I’m trying to ask is what helps you get through these moments. My boyfriend is very reassuring but I think it’s been going on for so long it’s not much of a comfort anymore ☹️ (I’m 23),1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq37no/health_anxiety_question_please_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq37no/health_anxiety_question_please_help/
1nq3829,1758796406,2025-09-25T10:33:26Z,mentalhealth,It's not getting better.,"It's been 6 months since my major depression first started and nothing has felt the same since. It's like my mind is constantly in brain fog and I barely remember things clearly anymore, like life is a hazy dream. I basically never have energy or motivation and am only able to do well in school these days because I'm intelligent and can get by without studying too much. The medication I'm on  (fluoxetine 20mg) only seemed to decrease my intrusive thoughts and anxiety a bit but did nothing for my depression. I am so sick and tired of trying therapy. It is completely useless to me as all they say is the same thing ""journal, breathe, do something productive"". The only friend I have is my mom who I love to the moon and back and has helped me through so much. I wish I was never born so she could have an easier life. I was also recently gr\*\*med online by a 20 year old man (I'm 15 btw), who pretended to be my friend and care for me and that was the happiest I had ever been in a while. But when I started developing feelings for him everything went horribly wrong. I realised he was not the person who I thought he was and that he was manipulating and taking advantage of me, and did not care about me at all. So I blocked him out of my life. I'm on school holiday and I'm trying my best to study and be productive but all I do most days is sit at home, play video games and scroll on social media. I know some of you might say: ""oh just go out and make some friends or do sports"", but that won't help me. You see, I do sports and theatre classes once a week and that's nice, but I cannot see myself suddenly becoming happy because of these things. I can be happy in the moment and then go home and feel completely miserable and numb. My biggest fear on earth is losing my mummy, seriously. She is the only person who truly loves me to her core and just to be embraced in her arms while I cry is the safest and best feeling in the world. I love her so much and if she's taken away from me too I might have to give up. I'm really trying, I am. Nothing feels good anymore. I know people might say ""you're so young! Why are you complaining! Wait until you have to pay taxes!"" But it's not that simple. There's a hole deep inside of me that nothing can fill. And I just see this world in a very miserable light recently. Like I have to finish school, go to university, get a job, and that all sounds so incredebly impossible for me. Even if I do it, I know it will all make me miserable. I wish there was another way. I wish I could just be a fairy living in an enchanted forest in the middle of nowhere with my fairy friends. I got a job at KFC today so I'm looking forward to that... maybe making some money will give me some worth. I feel worthless and unloveable because I lost trust in the only man who I really liked. Honestly, the only thing I am incredibely grateful for is that God has given me a perfect mother. I cannot imagine my life without her and I feel sad that she has to put up with me. I hope she gets peace one day.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq3829/its_not_getting_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nq3829/its_not_getting_better/

1nq4hgp,1758800583,2025-09-25T11:43:03Z,offmychest,My 2 year relationship was built on lies,"Hello there,  This is basically my first serious post on reddit, and its a long one, so im sorry for rambling/any mistakes. I(27m) have been in a relationship with my fiance(24f) for just under 2 years. The beginning of our relationship was a little rushed *more on her side but a little from both* I moved in pretty quick (really long story behind that and this is going to already be a long post so we'll skip that for now) after about 3-4 months? Well, after the 3 month marks the I love you's started, which i was okay with as 1.) I was the first one to say it. And 2.) Im all about the 3 month rule. Anyway, I said it freely, meaning it everytime. She, as I have recently learned, did not mean it until about 9 months in. Ive learned alot about the beginning of our relationship recently which is why im making this post. After I moved in it seemed like everything changed, she started hiding her phone, not really listening to my complaints on what made me uncomfy with the relationship. I.e she was talking to guys who openly flirted with her over text and in person and letting them flirt. I asked her to block them multiple times because I felt as though it was disrespectful to not just me but herself as well. The guys she was letting flirt/openly flirting back with them were also guys she had met on dating sites before we got together. So that also added to my feelings on her keeping them around I suppose. I knew she was talking to them and I just bottled it up and didnt say anything about it (wrong thing to do i know)  Eventually she told me she blocked them and all was good for a little bit.   Fast forward a month to my birthday and we go see sleep token in NYC (worship) I was still under the impression that she infact had her ex blocked. Turns out a few days later I asked her how she could afford a sweatshirt for herself. She tells me that her ex had sent her 500$ for the trip. Yeah, the ex she told me since the start of our relationship was blocked. So tensions were high again, I shut down, stopped being a boyfriend, started just existing. I became a really shitty partner, I was being mean, not giving her attention, all the bad shit. Well, instead of us sitting down and talking about it, she started unblocking people, hiding who she was talking to, the whole shebang.  Fast forward a few more months and I notice shes texting someone while sitting next to me. 4 letter name, I was pretty sure it was her ex's name but she was damn good at hiding her phone so I couldnt be sure, I shut down, basically had a mental breakdown because I convinced myself that she was lying for months about having him blocked after the concert. Well, we talked about it that night and she told me it wasnt him, gave me some random females name and I went to bed, next morning I wake up for work and I see that she has a notification from her ex on her lockscreen. I got mad and left, because she lied to me during a mental breakdown over something so small. I went through her phone that night after she went to bed (I led her to believe I was no longer mad, shitty thing to do i know but I needed answers) and found 3 days worth of sexting between them on snap. There were a few pictures between them as well but, my fiancé swears that they werent nudes/spicy but I still dont believe that aspect and i dont think i ever will. I wasnt going to share what was said in the messages, however it's a really big issue in our relationship for me and my entire reason for making this post is to talk about the issues somewhere. The sexting started off pretty mundane, they each talking about wanting to have sex (no mention of with each other, just normal talk between two friends) then he started getting more direct about it, ""remember xyz time we did this?"" ""Oh yeah I remember that was fun."" Well by the end of the first night of their chat they werent speaking directly about one another however, it was alot of ""id LOVE for someone to do this to me👀."" The next day it continued, but now they were just speaking directly about each other. They talked about the things they liked that the other did, what they wanted the other to do. Then, it turned into, what my fiancé says was ""her boosting the wrong man's ego."" I am not the longest noodle in the pot of spaghetti, im not the shortest, however I'm definitely not the longest. I struggle alot with insecurities based on past relationships and sexual encounters. My fiancé was always one to tell me how good I was, and how I was the perfect size for her, and how he ex was uncomfortable because of his size. Well, during the second day/night of sexting, she told him ""You please me better than he ever could."" ""Youre so much better than him and I love that."" ""God i just love how big you are"" among a few other compliments I'm just not really wanting to talk about. She told him that she was playing with herself thinking about what he was going to do to her, told him I was up sleeping in the room so he could come over if he wanted. The third day of sexting was mainly them just setting up a hook up. A few sexual comments here and there from both sides but, ended with them setting up a hook up.  Then came August, 7 months into our relationship same month I found out she was sexting, just about 2 weeks into the month now. I found out a few more times that she had lied about not blocking someone/still talking to them when she promised she wasnt. It finally hit a boiling point, we got into a huge fight in the morning, she ended up having an interview that day, she ended up not coming home after the interview. Went over to a guy's, who she met on BFF, house to ""get to know him better."" At this point in the relationship I stopped going through her phone because I wanted to stop finding things that she was doing, so I never read their chat, although I can guess some of the things he was talking about to her. Things escalated, he kissed her, oral was given to her. She told me she was into that, and then he assaulted her. She went back and forth about telling me or not for over a year because she wasnt really sure if she got assaulted. She told me she wasn't into it, but she didnt tell him no. She stayed silent as things developed, which, silence is not a form of implied consent for you creeps in the back. The big issue I have with this event, is we have a child together, and when she did the math on conception, it turned out that our son would have been conceived right around that time. Based on some things from my last relationship she was very adamant on the fact that there was no possible way our child was not mine.  About 2 months later, we got into one of the worst fights we ever had. I ended up moving in with a buddy of mine back home, for about a month? Her and i still talked every day, she was pregnant at the time and i wanted to be in my baby's life even if her and I couldnt make it work. Being away for that month was hard, but things seemed to get alot better. I ended up moving back at the end of the month.   Fast forward over a few smallish issues, and we get to today, 2 weeks after I was told/reminded of things. We were arguing over something dumb, talks of breaking up happened. The way she told me about that night in August was ""I fucked that other guy."" I beat myself up now because, well, she didnt fuck that guy, she was assaulted. I wasnt nice about the entire situation, I wasnt supportive. She told me the other day about the assault. How some was consensual, and other parts werent. She told me that, she wasnt actually in love with me until I moved back in in October, and that ruined me. She let me believe that the feelings were mutal for over half of our relationship. So I was mean, I was unsupportive, and im a terrible person for that. She's in solo therapy to work through her issues, and what happened. We're looking into couples therapy. We're trying to fix what we have.  I guess I should finish here, thank you so much if you read my fucked up story on my love life.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq4hgp/my_2_year_relationship_was_built_on_lies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq4hgp/my_2_year_relationship_was_built_on_lies/

Getting my body moving, even if it's just a quick stretch or stroll.      restricting my incessant scrolling when I'm feeling overloaded.      conversing with a friend rather than withdrawing.

We have similar strong personalities, but I was just a kid dealing with my own issues, neglect from my mom, and verbal abuse from my grandmother. My aunt would explode when she didn’t get her way, gossip, and trash-talk everyone (especially my mother). I’ve always resented her for that.  As an adult, I finally got away, built my own life, and worked on healing from years of chaos. But after my grandmother passed, I decided to move back home to save money, go back to school, and help my aging grandpa.  Coming back has been hell. The house is a mess—rat droppings, roaches, dog smell, piles of junk, and my aunt contributes nothing. She works a part-time job, drinks every day, gossips nonstop, and spends all her time with some new woman. Meanwhile, I’m juggling a full-time job, full-time college, taking my grandpa to appointments, and trying to keep the house livable. I’m exhausted.  When I asked her to simply give my grandpa his medication at night (since I work late), she blew up. I finally snapped back at her, and now we don’t even speak. She wakes up miserable, leaves messes everywhere, lets her dog shit all over the yard, and refuses to clean. It’s draining my mental health.  When I vent to my mom, she just says, “Well, you decided to move back home.” But I feel trapped—if I leave, my grandpa will be stuck with her. She pays no bills, does nothing but wallow, and I honestly can’t take it anymore.  I told myself after my grandpa passes I’m cutting this family off .   TLDR: Moved back home to save money and help my grandpa, but my aunt is lazy, toxic, and the house is disgusting.

What do I mean specifically when I say ""nature of anxiety""?   My anxiety used to be this hidden monster that only jumped at me whenever I was told to do something that triggers me. Like making a phonecall or visiting a new location. Those anxiety spikes were much more intense to the point they paralysed me. Normally it was around 10% active during the day but skyrocketed in stressful situations to around 70-80% and at that point I couldn't do anything. So I retreated to my shell.   Few years forward. Due to journaling and some serious self-reflection I finally managed to get out of my comfort bubble and started going to school again to continue my education. I faced what I was scared of the most. People. And I've noticed that my anxiety levels got ""equalized"" after jumping over that barrier. I don't have those paralysing spikes but now my anxiety levels are constantly on 40-50% no matter if I'm near a stressor or not. I'm in this constant alert state. Even when I'm not at school and I'm just vibing at home, trying to relax. The monster is not assaulting me out of nowhere anymore but now it's sitting beside me and awkwardly looking at me every minute like a salty girlfriend.   It's true that I feel braver and going out to the world isn't that much of a problem anymore which I'm happy about... but the price is that I'm having more trouble sleeping which wasn't an issue before. And it's interesting because it's purely a physical response. I managed to quiet down my thought patterns... but it's like my body itself didn't get the memo yet.   Is that a normal thing to go through? I'm suspecting it's just my body ""updating"" itself and trying to adapt to a new environment or something. Right? That would make sense to me. I'm just hoping it's a temporary change because existing in this constant alert state is much more tiring.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq4xxk/nature_of_my_anxiety_is_changing_after_facing_its/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq4xxk/nature_of_my_anxiety_is_changing_after_facing_its/

My last therapy session is today.   Around 2 months ago, I met someone I really like [20 F]. I was hungover and we hit it off pretty much immediately, next week we go on date number 5. We have the same humor, similar but different interests and love to hear each other talk about those interests. They study music and I find their course so fascinating, and they find the fact I’m a student nurse fascinating (albeit mildly disturbing at times lmao).  I really like this person, I can’t stop thinking about them. They consume my thoughts and I just want to be with them. Even just messaging is enough, we have such a healthy dynamic where that if one of us needs to do something or needs to reschedule, that’s totally okay. We’ve made it clear to each other that saying no is alright, something I’ve never had in past relationships.  I’m so scared that one day they may move on to someone else, they’ve said (unprompted) they’re not messaging or speaking to anyone else, but I don’t see myself as being worthy of someone so attractive, kind, gentle and understanding.   I don’t think you’re a Reddit girlie, but if you see this, I really like you. If you asked me to be your partner, id say yes before you finished the sentence. <3",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq639o/im_scared_to_be_loved/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq639o/im_scared_to_be_loved/

I've done all the things--meds, CBT, meditation--you get it, you've done it, too.  It's challenging but I manage my anxiety fairly well.   Well, 2 weeks ago my home flooded from a broken pipe. Most of my home is currently unusable and down to the very studs for repair. (Don't worry, I'm not about to ask for money.  Insurance will handle it).  I realize how much my home forms a safe base for dealing with my anxiety because my GAD is back, vicious, and spiraling to depression.  I'm mean, half panicked, and hopeless.    I know I need to go back on Effexor, which has worked well in the past. I feel like such a failure.  I thought I had this managed.  I know I would tell anyone else they aren't a failure for using meds but I can't stop judging myself for it.   I guess I just need to hear from others who understand. Do you have angry spells when your anxiety is spiraling?  I'm ashamed.  I'm also interested if anyone has other drug options that may work--effexor works well for me but it's a tough ramp onto it as well as off of it, and the side effects can be troublesome (especially the weight gain).

From there on everything changed.   Every single day, even when I’m not anxious or thinking about anything. This weird sensation comes to my head that I can’t describe. It’s like a pressure and it makes me feel lightheaded and like I’m going insane or I’m going to break out into a massive panic. It’s manifested itself in multiple ways over the past months.   It’s given me chest tightness, vertigo, nauseous and now a feeling of a lump in my throat.   At this point I don’t even think it’s anxiety and I’m scared I’m going to die. Has anyone else experienced this? I had a chest xray and bloods ago about 3 months ago that all came back fine. But this feeling just can’t be shaken.   When I first had the huge panic episode I felt extremely heavy on my chest and suddenly I was shaking, having hot and cold flushes and just felt disorderly and like I was dying or something bad was happening.

1nq6fl8,1758806015,2025-09-25T13:13:35Z,Anxiety,"Even if i become a normal person one day, it wont be anytime soon","i am 22 years old and have been struggling with anxiety for a long time.  For as long as i can remember, i was a shy, quiet child. Until high school, i didnt really care; i just lived my life. i had computer games and my family, and i knew nothing about life. When i started high school, i realized how troubled i was. Being in class made me anxious. i couldnt make eye contact. i had very little interaction with people. if someone asked me something, i would give evasive answers with a smile. As you can imagine, i had no self-esteem. i still smile at everything. i hate it because i dont do it because i feel like it.     i dont want to make this it longer. if you are reading this, im sure you can empathize.  Turning in my story was when i started college. i was too embarrassed to go to classes and dropped out college. i was around 20 when this happened, and i fell into a deep depression. My body couldnt handle that much humiliation. Then i became an alcoholic     When i was drunk, i felt like a normal person. The more it worked, the more i wanted to drink, so i drank more. After a year of this, i actually managed to bring my anxiety down to a reasonable level, but i was still far from being a normal person. One day, i went to a psychiatrist. it was a big step for me. i went treatment for a year. after paying too much to him for this treatment. One day, i stopped taking the medication, and nothing changed. They were as ineffective as i had thought.     i no longer drink alcohol or take medication. i have a job now and i can go to work. i can go to the supermarket and shop without any difficulty. i even take the bus. My quality of life has greatly improved. But there is one thing that has not gotten better, and that is my social anxiety. When i have to talk to someone, i cant control my hands, i want to run away. My voice gets quieter. i say stupid things.   This morning i saw a girl sitting on the grass. i was very scared. When the thought of going to talk to her crossed my mind, i wanted to punch myself. i walked around twice, gathered my courage, and went over. i asked if i could sit down. She said yes.   i asked her name and where she lived, but then we ran out of things to talk about. When it got quiet, i panicked. i had crackers in my hand and i said, “i will eat these crackers and leave, you dont have to feel uncomfortable.” i quickly ate the crackers and got up.     i didnt want to be such a freak at 22, but i am. im slowly starting to accept everything. Even if i become a normal person one day, it wont be anytime soon. i want to shut myself off and live in my own world. i dont even know why i wrote all this. i hope you dont regret reading it",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq6fl8/even_if_i_become_a_normal_person_one_day_it_wont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq6fl8/even_if_i_become_a_normal_person_one_day_it_wont/

1nq7bg9,1758808229,2025-09-25T13:50:29Z,Anxiety,Is this GAD or Depression and would therapy help?,"Hi everyone,   I have been diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago, I am 41F. However I am wondering **if what I have is rather anxiety (GAD?)** at first which then turns into depression when it spirals and does not get treated. I having very specific symptoms and I am wondering if any of you has the same or similar ones and if you every found a way to treat this with therapy.   I am currently back on Effexor, now for 4.5 weeks after having been off it for about 7 months. My symptoms usually go like this:  * I have trouble filtering any kind of stimuli, especially noise, it feels like I have very thin skin and everything pours all over me * I hence get irritated easily, I feel on edge and have problems concentrating, cannot handle the slightest stress * I also feel tense, get short of breath, feel hyperaroused, do not get sleepy in the evening, always feel vigilant * I also have IBS (always had it already as a child) and often have pressure / feel of fear in my chest * I also tend to ruminate and catastrophize * I cannot fall asleep without something sedative, I cannot seem to shut my brain down, even if I do not think of anything specific * Oftentimes, I can't even fall asleep with something sedating, this then exacerbates, I feel more anxiety the next day and then on days, I have not slept, I am starting feeling depressed.  * What happened when I tried to fall asleep, the moment I realised, I dozed off, I got an adrenaline rush/ cortisol rush and felt intense anxiety. It was horrible. * Basically, it feels like my nervous system does not work properly and is always in fight or flight mode, like I have no shield  I have had this since my mid twenties at least, maybe earlier and it got more intense over the years. It started to increase when I started work after I finished studying. A couple of years ago, this went on for 2 years or so and then ended in Major depression. This is when I got put on Effexor. It worked and I took it for 4 years. Since I thought my problem is depression back then and I felt like I have solved the things for me I was depressed about before, I got off of Effexor. It was fine for like 3 months, but then about 4 months later I started not being able to fall asleep again, even with Mirtzapine. I got really bad sleep anxiety.   Finally, my doctor let me know that the sleep problems are usually a sign that the depression came back and that it is often the case after 3-6 months after coming off an SSRI / SSNRI.   I went back on Effexor and can now sleep again and feel more calm. But I also want to start therapy and I am wondering what kind of therapy would help with these symptoms. I am also wondering if therapy only would ever be enough, since many of my symptoms are very physical and not so much cognitive (except maybe the rumination part).  1. **Does / Did anyone have successful therapy for this?**  2. **Or would you say this definitely requires an SSRI / SNRI?** 3. **And would you say, this sounds like depression or anxiety / GAD?**  I have to say I also have some specific phobias, like spiders, fear of height and a little bit of health anxiety, fear of future.  I know the Effexor works, but my doctor says I should be on this infinitely because I have been dealing with this so long and this scares me because I might live another 40-50 years and I am afraid of long-term damage from these drugs. I am of course aware that anxiety and depression are also not great for my health.

1nq7fny,1758808519,2025-09-25T13:55:19Z,offmychest,I can’t live like this anymore,"I apologize if this isn’t exactly the right place to post this, but I didn’t know where else to post. I (25M) got broken up with by my abusive ex (29F) a little over 3 years ago, ending our 5 year relationship. After the breakup, I roughed it on my own for about 4 or 5 months, working a lot. My parents eventually convinced me to move to Houston and to move back in with them. After the breakup I struggled with severe depression and anxiety.   The issue with my parents is that, even though I know they want what’s best for me, they don’t understand me at all. My dad growing up only had one small time job before immediately getting into his career, facing success at almost every corner, so he doesn’t understand how hard it can be to get a well paying job nowadays, and my mom only had to work as a teacher for a year and a half before she became a stay at home mom.   I became depressed when I was 14, not long after I found out my uncle who understood me better than anyone committed suicide. I remember telling my dad one day on the way to school that I thought I was depressed, to which he responded “You’re too young to know what depression is”. When I turned 16, my 10 year old sister had a brain aneurysm and I watched her die in the hospital, which my parents never got me any therapy or counseling for. I was also born with severe clubbed feet (a condition where you’re born with your feet basically attached the wrong way) and I had 7 surgeries growing up as well, causing arthritis that only gets worse each year, making it harder and harder to walk and be on my feet in general.   Now that the backstory is out of the way, I can’t stand living here with them. I know they love me and care for me, but we are not alike in almost any way. Whenever my anxiety would get bad, during the first 1 1/2 years after moving here, my dad would get upset with me. I remember him telling me one time “You’re 22, you just moved here, you have no job. You have no excuse for acting like this” which only made me feel more like shit than I already did. Eventually, I put myself into therapy, and after a lot of arguing with my mom about how he treated me, she eventually convinced him to mellow out. Nowadays, he seems to try to understand, having gone to a therapist once to ask about info on anxiety and depression, but he never will understand. That’s not a diss to him, because depression and anxiety aren’t things you can understand unless you’ve dealt with them. My issue stems from the fact that my dad is a “fixer” type. There is no “ranting” “complaining” or just getting something off of my chest, because he will always turn it around and basically say “So what can you do better?”, trying to find a fix instead of ever just listening and talking.   Both of my parents are also EXTREMELY republican. I view myself as independent, believing both sides have points to make, but I’m more left leaning. They would never treat a gay/trans/etc. person poorly, but behind closed doors they are very homophobic. If I ever bring up any evidence for anything that is against what they believe, they immediately treat it as if I’m just a kid and don’t understand what I’m talking about.   When I first moved here, I had no fears of driving and was good at it, but after moving to Houston I was immediately in a wreck and it has made me fear ever getting on the road here. I’ve been trying to save up to move back to Georgia, but most jobs haven’t been calling back, except for one today which I completely fumbled, which is what set me off to make this post. I was on the way to the interview and nearly got hit by a car forcing its way into my lane, making me slam on brakes and nearly getting rear ended. It sent me into a panic attack and I had to pull over, missing the interview.   My home life consists of me staying in my room almost all day, or sitting in my car somewhere, because I can’t stand sitting on the couch watching tv for hours all day every day, which is all my family does. When I was in Georgia and on my own, I was depressed, sure, but I was actually building something for myself there. I wasn’t afraid to drive a half hour to a job or to my friend’s places, and I was working towards a future. Ever since moving here, my life has only gone down hill, and gotten worse and worse. I can’t live here, in a big city like this, it’s just not ME and I can’t handle it. The constant anxiety with crime rates and wrecks is ruining me. Not to mention the fact that all of my friends and other family members I’m close with are in Georgia still.   I’ve mentioned multiple times to my parents that I hate it here, that I wish I never moved back in with them, and that I want to move back to Georgia. I have a friend in Georgia who’s family I used to live with and they are so loving and caring, and they always have an empty room that they said I’m free to rent out as long as I need, and in turn I’d take care of a lot of the house work for them on top of paying rent. When I brought this up, my parents (especially my dad) always goes on about how terrible of an idea that is and that I shouldn’t move until I pretty much have a full blown career going; but to me, that just sounds like a trap by him because if I get a career going, I can’t just move because I’ll be stuck here in the job I have. I constantly feel looked down on and feel like he just sees me as a little kid who only makes bad decisions. It’s only ever a good idea if it’s an idea HE’S come up with. It feels like he’s only supportive of me when I’m doing what he wants, and I feel like it’s only building self destructive tendencies within me because of fear of disappointing him, and feeling resentment towards him at the same time. I want to move, and I know I’m an adult and can just take my car and leave no matter what he says, but at the same time I’m so fearful of making him hate me or upsetting him because at the end of the day he’s still my dad and I love him.  Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but thank you for taking the time to read it. I just needed to get this out somewhere.  tl;dr: I want to move out and my parents won’t allow it (I guess, idk, I’ve never made a tl;dr)",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq7fny/i_cant_live_like_this_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq7fny/i_cant_live_like_this_anymore/

(She has a child too btw) when I got there we had the most beautiful night ever and were laughing a lot and at the end we even kissed. After that I went to a friends house and we drank a little bit. I was completely fine. We texted a bit like that we miss each other I should’ve stayed longer e.g.   The next morning I woke up and that’s when anxiety kicked in and I just started behaving like absolutely cringe af around her when I went back to hers. It was like I was doing everything wrong on purpose. Even her talking to me made me feel so anxious I guess I was just scared of doing anything wrong. I told her the next day that this was too much for me and I’d rather stay friends…. But the way how I did it was so weird I like made myself look really really stupid and told her all that I’m insecure about and that I will probably forever stay a little boy and can’t deal with relationships.

She said she hears people yelling in her head. Obviously thats very alarming and points to something serious going on  I told her to tell her psych doctor because she needs medication. She said she wasn't going to take medicine for it and likes being psychotic because her voices tell her stories and keep her entertained without tv/internet   Still very alarming, and I can get why someone wouldn't want meds if that is true  So the bs monitor officially started going off after her friend messaged me and told me to tell my sister to stop copying her symptoms   This girl has schizophrenia, and sure enough, after looking on her page and screenshots of their conversations, all her symptoms were near identical to what my sister is claiming   She also acts like psychosis happens like panic attacks she will say ""im having a psychotic episode"" only an hour later saying its over. From what i know, psychosis doesn't happen like this.  So I'm pretty confused. For one. I don't want to dismiss this as fake. But on the other hand, this is alot of evidence that gives good reason to not believe her, as well as her not wanting to take medication.

I have seizures caused by anxiety that started back in 2021 causing me to be out of work for two years.  I had been saving up to move out. My dad has Parkinson’s and ever since he was diagnosed has really milked it. He loves getting sympathy for it. He uses it all of the time to make others feel guilty.  My dad has also called me a selfish b$t:/, for having seizures because it took my mom’s attention away from him. He manipulated and guilted me into lending him the $5,000 I got when I sold my car, because I wasn’t driving because of the seizures. I was 19 yo when we had gone out to eat and a buddy of his that he used to work with came over and sat down in the booth next to him. You could smell the beer on him. After a little bit, his wife came over and said she was going to the bathroom and then she’d be ready to go. She left and he got up. He walked over to my side of the booth and almost sat on me because it was unexpected. I moved quickly but our thighs were touching so I moved over and he scooted closer, I tried to move over again and he scooted closer and reached over me as if giving me a side hug and making kissy faces at me. I looked at my dad who was laughing and taking pics with his phone. I said okay that’s enough and the guy released but caressed my knee under the table. As we were heading out he stood and held the door open. I didn’t want to walk through the door, but I did anyway and he smacked me on the ass. I told my dad and he laughed. When we got to the car my dad said, “don’t tell your mom, or I’ll have to talk to him about it.”  One night, I overheard my sister talking with him about it and he said that he was teaching me to stand up for myself.  When I told his mom about it, she asked me what I was wearing or doing.  Even if we clean or go grocery shopping, he complains that we didn’t clean what he wanted done or that we didn’t do it right.  My mom is silent and won’t stand up to him. She once snapped at me and said, “well, what am I supposed to do about it.”  When I started having less seizures I got a small retail job and I got passed up for a key holder position 3 times because the new manager didn’t think I could handle the pressure. So, I had to start looking elsewhere. I became a substitute teacher which is no pressure at all right? lol.  I really enjoyed it and got my temporary teaching certification. This year was going to be my first official year as a teacher, but I had a panic attack before the second day of school. I eventually had to resign because of the anxiety.

I (30F) have been with my husband (30M) for over 7 years now. 2 years ago, my husband got laid off from his job, so we got married so he wouldn't have to be without health insurance (COBRA premiums were way too expensive and he has chronic anxiety that he needs to take meds for).  The whole time I've known him, he's always been a bit lazy, but it was always in ways I thought he would outgrow if he needed to. For example, he never really cleans around the house unless I specifically give him a task or the house gets so filthy it triggers his anxiety. This has always bothered me, specifically because he'll complain about how dirty it is, but not doing anything about it.  A few months after he got laid off, he got a new job that requires him to go to the office M-F. The problem is he's been waking up late and getting to work late. His new job requires employees to tell them what hours they plan on being in the office (weird, I know, but a policy is a policy, and he's allowed to pick whatever 9-hour period of time he wants as long as the building is open) and he was informed by his manager at their one-on-one that his actual clock-in times have been super sporadic and that HR might get involved.  He's always had a hard time waking up in the morning, so I started packing his lunch the night before and setting the coffee maker to make sure he has coffee ready for him when he's supposed to wake up. I also talked to him about going to bed earlier, not doom scrolling before bed, putting his phone across the room at night so when the alarm goes off, he has to physically get up to turn it off, etc. Apparently, none of that has worked.  I recently found out that he will get out of bed (after I force him to turn off his alarm), let the dog out to potty, then fall asleep on the couch. I'm currently on disability right now due to a recently-diagnosed health issue, and I have been getting up around 10am since I'm not working and my illness makes me very fatigued. I've been shocked to find him still sleeping on the couch when I get up. My husband's reported hours are supposed to be 7am-4pm (he picked those times bc he doesn't want to work late and said traffic is bad if he goes later).  He tells me it's because he doesn't like his job and he doesn't like getting up in the mornings, but I feel super taken advantage of and I feel sooo mad. I feel like crap all day and would love to sleep 24/7, but I still get up, clean/vacuum the house, make sure all his meals are made, make his coffee (which I don't drink), and do my best to make his life comfortable, and he can't even get to work on time. If he loses his job again, I don't know what I'll do. My job has already basically said there's going to be layoffs soon because the economy isn't doing well, and my disability benefit won't last forever.   I feel like the only adult in my relationship and I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do at this point. It feels so stupid to be this upset by someone not getting up early, but I really feel so hopeless and lonely.",8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq9lfj/im_starting_to_resent_my_husband/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nq9lfj/im_starting_to_resent_my_husband/
1nq9q7o,1758813860,2025-09-25T15:24:20Z,Anxiety,Feel like I'm not in control of my own life,"For the past week and a half, I've gotten chronic deja vu. Like, every waking moment feels like I've dreamed it before. I feel like I've dreamed writing this post right now, down to the word. I felt like I dreamed having all the random thoughts I had this morning. I felt like I dreamed writing the essay I wrote yesterday, again, while I was writing it. I felt like I dreamed all of the events of 2 games of Stellaris. I felt like I dreamed every conversation I've had with family these past few days.   I know this is all in my head, I even made a post on r/precognition about this, but it's very clear this isn't what people typically think is ""precognition"" because I don't remember the ""dreams"" before my brain processes the event in real life. And every single time my brain HAS processed something lately, it's always felt VERY fucking familiar. It feels like I'm reliving entire days, or that my whole life has been predestined. I took my mom to a lake yesterday to get both of us out of the house and do something new. I couldn't have possibly dreamed that, right? I've never seen the lake before. But no, apparently my brain thinks that I have, because once I saw it, it just gave me the same eerie familiarity. Same with the pictures she took of us by said lake. Pictures she just took that I've never seen until she showed me.  I haven't felt the feeling of ""oh I haven't done this, this is a mildly new thing"" in a week and a half. I haven't felt...initiative, too, like ""oh I'm going to make this decision"". I make decisions and do things just fine, my executive dysfunction is at normal levels. But I feel like every decision I make, whatever it is, was already made? Like I'm just numb and going through the motions and don't really have any effect on my own life? I'm almost subconsciously aware that everything is fate and was ""dreamed"", but consciously suspicious that I don't remember having said dreams and they're obviously just false memories that my brain's had a field day creating every 5 minutes.  I've done research into this, apparently it's a symptom of a certain type of epilepsy, which I have no family history of, and...if I had it, this would've happened sooner. This is the first time my brain thinks I dreamed entire weeks to the last detail, as well as every minor decision, big and small, I've executed. I'm 16, yes, my brain isn't fully developed yet, but epilepsy I do believe develops right as puberty starts.  The other explanation aside from the spiritual is a minor psychotic/DPDR episode. Which would...make a lot of sense, apparently extreme stress can cause them in some people, especially in neurodivergents or people with anxiety and mood disorders. I've noticed that my ADHD's been ""flaring up""? Like, sometimes for most of if not an entire day, I feel out of it? Like I'm in a dream? Foggy, can't focus on anything, just off? Like not there? Yeah, I've had that feeling every day since I've been getting all this deja vu and internally freaking out over it because I get intrusive thoughts. ""What if this is fate, and what if your fate is to be a terrible person."" ""What if you're not wrong, you literally can't control yourself, and you are just here to suffer through a fucked-up life.""  So yeah, it's been great. Coming here because the psychosis explanation is the most likely. This past 2 months has been constant stress and bouts of panic attacks and guilt and unsurety. I don't know how my life is going to pan out, and it fucking scares me, especially recently now that part of my brain thinks that I don't even have control of my future, and I didn't have control over my past, either. My past, where I was an objectively terrible person who hung around objectively terrible people.  I know these episodes are typically brief, so how the hell do I claw myself out of this before I do something stupid and end up in a padded cell screaming about fate and my ""dreams""?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq9q7o/feel_like_im_not_in_control_of_my_own_life/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nq9q7o/feel_like_im_not_in_control_of_my_own_life/
1nq9s6z,1758813984,2025-09-25T15:26:24Z,Anxiety,Klonopin withdrawal and newly diagnosed with BPD,"Hello everyone  Prescription background: Ive been taking antidepressants since the age of 15ish, I started getting klonopin by age 24 since I started having severe panic / anxiety attacks and outbursts I couldn’t control. I took klonopin once in a while but eventually got addicted to it and started taking it daily for about a 1.5 - 2 years, dosage would vary 0.5 mg - 1.5 mg, then switched to Bondormin (which is part of the Benzos family here) and  Escitalopram 15 mg for 3.5 years, in the beginning of the year I lowered the Escitalopram to 7.5 and started re added the Klonopin again starting with 0.5 mg, as months went on the dosage went up, I’m 28 now and I’m taking Wellbutrin 150mg for 2 months, and 1 month of Trazodone 100mg.  About 3 months ago I was stuck in another country for a month with no access to any medications, and the nights were spent consuming alcohol to cope.  Since coming back 2 months ago I continued to take klonopin 1 mg but I haven’t been functioning, so much so that about a month ago I was admitted into a psychiatric ward. When I got there I didn’t eat for a week, and I was in deep depression etc. I was there for about two weeks and they got me eating again, and the biggest thing of them all, they told me to quit klonopin cold turkey.  Here is where the real story begins: I was not prepared for the surreal hell that I would go through. A nurse told me that I should quit Klonopin and the best way to do it is cold turkey is what he said, so I listened. The night that I quit was before the day that I was suppose to get released I didn’t sleep a second, and I felt my sanity spiral down, I was in bed since 22:00 PM and awake the entire time, at around 4:00 AM I went to sleep in the smoking area on the floor with a pillow between my legs, granting me 45 minutes of sleep until waking up to one of my worst moments, got trazodone later that day before leaving (life saver for sleep). I also got diagnosed with BPD, and I think the gloves fits and it explains a lot about my past life, and making an effort to learn about it.  Week 1: The first week of withdrawal was filled with intrusive thoughts and obsessive behavior towards them, constant anxiety especially when waking, and strong headaches, low appetite, racing heart beats, anxiety spike before/while/after eating, low blood pressure, and mood swings. It feels like the thoughts and obsession were the worst downside of this week.  Week 2: It seems like everything I mentioned seemed to get worse, plus it feels like my focus attention and general cognitive abilities were flushed down the shitter, windows seemed to appear less frequent then at week 1.  Week 3: Generally windows are more frequent even though anxiety seems to still linger, but when a wave comes oh so help me god, I go crazy, crying, drooling all over the place, I get aggressive I scream, it’s very exhausting. Besides that symptoms of week 1 are still valid maybe abut milder.  Conclusion: This is unbeatable I have moments where I want to end myself, the weeks are short but the days are long, I try to study or play my instrument and I feel like I’m handicapped. Will I ever be stable again? Is there anything you could advise me to do? Everything I tell myself “This is because of withdrawal” or “This is because of BPD” it feels like I’m lying to myself.

Almost everyday since May, I've felt like I'm not myself. Like I'm a liar even when I'm not, like I need to prove myself when I already have, and like I'm probably a bad person but just no one knows. I have felt like I've lied about things that I haven't and I have needed to get reassurance for those things from others to feel better, that was near the beginning. I still feel like i want to reach out for reassurance, it feels like im causing some sort of hurt or pain mentally to those around me by not telling them, like i owe them, thats honestly what upsets me the most. However i dont give into these feelings anymore and they go away eventually. Now, knowing that is an unhealthy way to cope, I feel I'm always being evaluated or watched. I feel I and everyone will remember all of my thoughts and actions and I analyze every single thought that comes into my head to make sure my intentions were right. Ignoring them works for a bit, but the uneasy feeling is still there and I'm aware I'm trying to remedy the feeling and that sometimes sends me into a spiral of feeling like if I wasn't a bad person or if I wasn't doing something wrong I wouldn't have to distract myself and it all starts over again. Also I will have memories about the past, sometimes not even memories just somethong will remind me of someone in my past, and i panic. I feel I'm doing something bad by remembering. Like there is a huge deeper meaning and I can't escape it. Of course, this makes the memories more frequent, so i do my best to let them come and go until they dont anymore. I feel I'm always checking if I still feel anxious. Looking back, I see a lot of things I did as a kid that align with compulsions and other symptoms of maybe OCD or some mental issue, like i needed to blow air in my eyes constantly and evenly, i felt my teachers were always going to tell on me fpr things i didnt etc. My current symptoms started in May though.

1nqaki2,1758815807,2025-09-25T15:56:47Z,offmychest,Am I a bad person?,"So, basically, all my younger years I was raised with a lot of drama around me. My sister, who is older than me and we don't have the same dad, and My mom would fight a lot and I would always try to comfort my sister the best I can. At some point my mom even managed to give my sister a bloody lip and My dad has told me about it.   Flash forward a few years, my sister moved out, but I knew that wouldn't stop my mom from trying to fight with me at this point. Everytime I refused to do something, she'd yell and scream at me to do it. Even it would sometimes get physical. I normally tried to stay quiet. But eventually I had enough and I try to fight back against it now, but that just makes it worse, and even when I stay quiet, that makes it worse too. I don't even know what to do anymore. She threatened me this morning that she will send me to like whatever a detention camp is I have no clue what that is. But generally I don't like to be told to do things. And it's possible I could have Autism and My mind is just different because of the fact I used to take epilepsy medication, but she doesn't even try to understand me or see where I'm coming from. She just thinks I'm defiant. Which I guess I am but I have mental problems that make me feel like I just can't do things sometimes but she doesn't even try to have any patience some days.   But more recently, my mom got diagnosed and we found out she had kidney stones, and she keeps accusing me of not caring because I'm more flinchy and whenever she comes near me in loud tones or sometimes in general get in a fight or flight mode, and I dont normally flight, so my mind chooses fight and I can't help it my body just remembers the past and I don't know what else to do in my mind. So, I have kicked at her a few times, but I couldn't control myself from doing so it felt almost like instinct.   But this morning, I woke up at 7 in the morning but I was still tired so I went back to sleep for a few hours after. I mostly woke up because I heard my mom and dad making noise in the living room like my dad using the microwave to hear up food and such. And when I woke up again, I just heard her screaming at me to wake up (I have online school at 10 in the morning that's why she woke me up) but I got scared in a sense and was mad because I got woke up from my slumber, but I heard her calling me an asshole to my dad because I kicked at her from my flight or fight response. But is it bad for me to say that I don't actually care? I feel bad for her having kidney stones sure but I don't necessarily care because of all I've been through with her as well.   Not to add, she does things to get me annoyed too, but I can get irritated easily but she does it just to start a fight with me. My dad annoys me too, but never tries to start a fight with it, mostly my mom starting fights.   And also, my mom starts unnecessary fights with my dad too. Like if he spends money and she doesn't agree with it or if he makes his own choices for once and she doesn't agree with his choice like for instance my dad chose an oven when our old one went out but my mom threw a fit because the oven didn't have a back to it so she could sit candles on the back of it like she did with the old one.  And there's more - My dog his name is Sparky bites himself perhaps from allergies or anxiety and my mom hit him this morning when he was biting himself. She has also hit the dog when the dog tried to bite at her when she doesn't realize he's there. Like that's not even the dogs fault you moved your foot near him cause you didn't know he was there and he didn't understand it wasn't a threat.   But I don't know, Am I a bad person for not caring about her when all my life she's never shown a sliver of care to me? She's also said emotionally harming stuff to me as well.. Like calling me lazy (I have diagnosed depression and she knows that.) But I don't know.. I just have to get this off my chest in some way..

It’s like my brain goes: “Something’s wrong, your heart is pounding too hard” and then my anxiety spirals.  I’ve had EKGs and checks at the hospital, and they were fine, but the awareness itself is what scares me. It’s exhausting.

I honestly think I needed help since I was little but I didn't receive it back then and after I turned 18, despite wanting to, I found it too overwhealming to actually make an appointment. For the last couple of months I though I was doing better but I think I was just lying to myself and pushing myself too much, and it broke me down. I haven't been this depresses and anxious in years, I can't function anymore. I ended up telling my mom about my anorexia in 2023 and 2024 and some thoughts she was convinced were OCD (my father is diagnosed with it). There's much more going on but she refuses to aknowledge it. She sent me to a psychiatrist anyway, though.  The lady was nice but I can't say I'm 100% satisfied with the visit and it's mostly my fault tbh. I was so scared that I found it hard to talk. I kept stuttering and changing topics and ended up shoehorning complains and worrying stories about my family every second question she asked, instead of getting to the point. I kept saying ""I don't know"" and was too unsure of myself to really state any issue. I forgot what I wanted to tell her, I even forgot to check the notes I made to remember. I mixed up a lot of stuff, it also seems she misunderstood some of the things I said. I'm sure she had good intentions but the way she pressured me to give her details I didn't understand or remember, didn't let me finish some of the things I was trying to get to and didn't give me enough time to think didn't help. She said I should see a therapist to learn to understand my emotions better but I do understand them, I just doubt them when I don't feel comfortable, especially in new situations and under pressure to figure it out quickly. She also suggested that I might've experienced abuse as a child, which I know and appreciate that she said it but now I feel guilty for talking about it.  She did prescribe me antidepressants, adviced that I get my blood tested and recommended me a therapist, so I can't say she didn't do anything. But I didn't get any real insight into what might be going on and I didn't share what I wanted. My mom isn't satisfied with how it went and wanted to send me to another psychiatrist and I wonder if that's a good idea. I could also try to talk to a psychologist or a therapist if that's better for my situation?

My boyfriend is super handsome, fit, and well-built. And then there’s me… average-looking at best, overweight, and my self-confidence is basically nonexistent. Standing next to him, I feel like people are automatically going to judge me and think, “what is he doing with her?”  To make things worse, he wants me to hang out with them every day while they’re here. I honestly don’t even know how I’ll survive one meeting mentally, let alone multiple. But I also don’t want to disappoint him, or seem like I’m being difficult.

1nqedbr,1758824461,2025-09-25T18:21:01Z,offmychest,I am in a constant state of missing the past and I'm not sure how to deal with this.,"I've been dealing with this for a LONGGG time, and I just recently realized that It's just me not living in the present and like begging for the feeling of nostalgia. I literally do not KNOW how to live in the present. I'm mostly wondering if I'm not alone in this. I've been seeing a therapist for a few years and I'm seeing a psychiatrist soon to manage my depression and anxiety, but this definitely doesn't help with it and I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way and if anyone knows how to manage it?  Some examples of me trying to feel nostalgic are listening to music that reminds me of a certain time in my life, I have multiple playlists for this, reading through old messages of people I used to talk to / some people I STILL talk to, looking through old videos and photos, TikToks and snapchat memories, anything that I can get access to I like get an urge sometimes to look through them even though I've looked through them a million times. It's like a weird drug that I crave. Yesterday I was at work and it was super slow, so I went through my old messages with this long distance talking stage I had earlier this year. Reading through all of them gave me the exact feeling I felt during that time. I cant describe if it was a good or a bad feeling, I just knew that I was craving to feel that way. What was also weird was I knew later my boyfriend was going to pick me up from work and we were hanging out for the rest of the night and we were gonna have another sleepover. and the second I got in his car and we got to walk around the mall and I got to talk to him and hold his hand it felt SO good knowing I wasn't talking with that freak who's messages I was reading through earlier in the day and I'm confusing myself wondering why I enjoyed that as much as I did. and I knew I wasn't reading through the messages because I missed the guy, he owes me money and was also really weird and creepy which is why I stopped talking to him in the first place.   The one thing that confuses me about all this the most is the fact I like looking at stuff from good and bad times. I love watching my old TikToks from when I was like 11 and when I was happy all the time and lived life, but I also like looking through the ones where I was insanely depressed while with my toxic ex. I have a few times in my life that I specifically REALLY like the feeling of. Some of those times include fall of 2020, winter 2020, fall 2021 / spring 2022, a bit of summer 2023, and fall 2023. I didn't really have that many huge things going on during this time. Fall 2020 was when I got with my toxic ex (obviously before I knew he was toxic) and I started my freshman year of high school. Winter 2020 I just talked with my friends a lot and played a ton of video games. Fall 2021 and spring 2022 was when I got more into Rec Room and started a HUGE friend group off there. Summer 2023 was when I met my ex best friend (who I still miss very much even though he treated me terribly nearing the end of our friendship). And fall 2023 was when I got with my most recent ex. Some of these times in my life were TERRIBLE for me mentally, and so thats why I don't really understand WHY I miss that feeling. Like I cant live in the present at all. I'm constantly thinking about the past like its a drug that I cant live without. Sometimes I wish I could just go back in time and relive some of those old memories just for a day, or like talk to my former self and tell her everything.  I absolutely love everyone in my life at the moment. I have great friends, my parents are mostly supportive, my boyfriend is lovely, I have a stable job and DoorDash on the side, I'm working on getting a new car and on going to college soon (I am 19, 20 in April) and besides my severe depression that I'm working on getting treatment for, I live a pretty happy life for the most part. I don't understand why I constantly want to go back, even if it's just for a little.

1nqeh5a,1758824705,2025-09-25T18:25:05Z,Anxiety,Anxiety and depression has made my life miserable,"From what I can remember, I have always had anxiety from a very young age. In school I would hate being asked to read out loud or asked a question by a teacher. I would struggle to read in front of people and felt dumb when asked something I didn't know. In my teenage years it got worse to the point I would start sweating excessively in those situations and heart palpations. I always had a fear of school because I had to socialise so much, I just didn't realise it was anxiety at the time.   In my adult years, now 29M. Work has become the main cause of my anxiety while social interactions is still a close second. I am terrified of the responsibility, the mistakes, the tasks I need to complete and time to do so. I was unemployed most of 20s because of it. After college, I managed to find a job eventually which I lasted 2 years in some how I couldn't handle it anymore so I started a new job 2 months ago. Unfortunately my anxiety is still the same. It makes me sick every morning thinking about it all. I cannot relax, I am constantly thinking about work 24/7 to the point I wake up hours before my alarm in pool of sweat and heart racing. I can't enjoy or look forward to anything I plan and do outside of work. I honestly don't know how to work 35 more years like this. I feel so depressed all the time because of it I rarely want to do anything other than get into bed and wait for the next day to relive the nightmare all over again.  I have been off work the last 2 weeks with my anxiety and depression. The doctor finally gave me medication for it and recommend therapy which I am going to do but I feel it won't be enough to stop this. My boss knows and has been very nice and understanding about it. Work is such a necessary fundamental part of our life. If I can't manage to stop feeling anxious about it 24/7 then I don't know what other options I have other than being unemployed and depending on my fiancée which would cause severe financial stress on us.

So for example, if you say something to someone in a group of people and your friends that cut you off saved you from ruining something, it seems to me if they try to change the subject, don't just go quiet and not say anything else but to just roll with them.

1nqepdf,1758825229,2025-09-25T18:33:49Z,offmychest,"I’m stuck in a job I can't tolerate. I already had a hard time being around a coworker I had strong feelings for, but then he got promoted over me, and my managers have treated me badly for daring to ask why.","I've never done anything like this before, posting a long vent like this on Reddit. I was surprised at how long it took me to write it in a way I was satisfied with. All names are fake.  This job is at a very large non-profit establishment in the US, considered a hotspot for local arts. In the department I work in, there are around 35 people.  I began in January 2024 at the same time as two others, Luke and Lindsey. At that time, Luke was 22, I (F) was just about to turn 24, and Lindsey was 26. I guess we all considered each other cool from the start, but didn't immediately jump to hang out outside of work or anything.  In August or September, Luke was promoted to take on some more responsibilities, what I'll call ""Level 2."" At around the same time, he asked if I wanted his number so I could contact him about transport — he gave me a ride home often, if our shifts ended at the same time. He wanted to offer it even if we didn't work at the same time, saying that he could swing by work and pick me up anyway if he was free.  In December, right after I was also promoted to Level 2, Luke broke up with his girlfriend while they were still living together. She sounds like she was a real piece of work, but I won't get into that. It wasn't until January that he was able to move out. I helped him, and it was an interesting day. We had the usual moving woes, struggling with heavy stuff, playing Tetris to fit everything in the van, etc. We did also, unfortunately, briefly run into the ex. After 5 or so hours of hard work, we went out to dinner. He was buying, in exchange for my help.  When I got home, I was already kind of in a stupor from being so sore and eating a ton of food, and got stoned to unwind. I was on my couch, sore and cold and sleepy, and tried to think of how nice it would be to have Cole, another coworker from a different department I'd been interested in, there to snuggle... but suddenly, no matter how much I tried to imagine Cole, his face kept morphing back into Luke's. I couldn't stop thinking about the way the lights of the restaurant caught in his eyes, and how his top front teeth showed a little bit when his mouth gaped open when I got to the craziest parts of my college stories, and his snort! He hates that he snorts when he laughs, he gets all flustered about it.  I hoped desperately that this was just brought on by the coma-like state I was in, a harmless fantasy because sometimes you just can't help having those about friends, but once I'd sobered up the next morning, I realized I really did feel this way.  The next few months saw us meeting up many times outside of work. Once, in a spur of the moment thing, we went out to a coffee shop that stays open super late, and ended up talking about just about every topic you can imagine until 1 in the morning. I had dinner with him and my 2 best non-work friends on my birthday (February). He lives pretty close to the college I went to, so I gave him a casual tour in March. Most interestingly, over time, he stopped having a strong reaction when I pointed out his snort. At first, he was like, ""goddammit! No! Fuck! Stop! I hate you!"" but over time, he came to just nod, grin ruefully, and say ""yeah."" I thought that was a great sign, that he was accepting that I liked this thing about him that he was embarrassed about, as if he was letting me in.  One day in April, we were planning to go to the zoo, but then his car broke down at 11:30 the night before — and amazingly, I happened to know, just from casual conversation with her, that Lindsey and her boyfriend *were also going to the zoo that day*, and they were happy to give us a ride. I was so excited that this massive coincidence had happened, allowing us to keep our plans — I'm not a superstitious person, but that was really hard to not read into.  While at the zoo, Luke made a joke that really upset me: basically, he implied that I was somehow a bad person for having not heard of something he liked. Once Lindsey and her BF dropped us off back at Luke's house, we sat down on the couch, and I teared up and said, ""you know I really like you, but your joke earlier really hurt. I am not less of a person for not liking the same things as you."" He gasped and said he didn't realize that it would land that way. We had another long talk that veered into many different topics, including some stuff like the environments we grew up in, and showed each other some really old selfies, *and he straight-up said I was cute in one from 5 years ago.* Then we went out to eat again, and then parted ways.  Over text, I later suggested that I could make him dinner at my place for our next time hanging out, which I was worried was a little too forward... but he said it was fine, and we set a date. Unfortunately, a couple days later, he sent me a text that said ""after looking over my schedule, I'm gonna have to back out - the past few months have been really demanding with work. I will happily reach out to you when I have the time and energy.""  Over the next month, I did not know how to approach him at work. I didn't know if he needed space there, too. There were times when I wanted to cry just from being in the same room as him because I was so confused, and how can someone sitting right next to you feel like they're on the other side of the country? He was promoted to ""Level 3,"" and I didn't know how to congratulate him. I don't think I even mentioned it.  Finally, in early May, my therapist helped me draft a text that said ""I'm getting mixed signals and would appreciate knowing what your boundaries are."" Luke replied, ""I enjoy our friendship, but I need space as a person. I want to be able to build a life outside of our workplace (he's fairly new to town) and need to think about the boundaries that I have to build for that to happen.""  I was torn between three long responses, which boil down to:  1. ""I can't relate to that, I don't understand how to have a friendship that only exists in one place, so I think we should just keep it professional;"" 2. ""I actually have feelings for you, and what I want would DEFINITELY be against your idea of boundaries, so I think we should just keep it professional;"" 3. and ""I can't relate to that, I don't understand how to have a friendship that only exists in one place, but I have learned to adapt to situations I don't understand before, so that's fine!""  I wish I could have sent the first one, but I was desperate to keep him in my life however I could. So I picked the third one.  The next time I saw him was at work on his birthday; I'd gotten him a novelty T-shirt of his favorite actor, which earned a snort. I asked if we were good, and he seemed genuinely surprised and said ""yes! We're friends!"" and pinky-swore it.  Looking back on it, I do think that we were more or less on the right path to eventually develop something, between his acceptance of me making him snort, his willingness to discuss really deep or personal topics with me, and a couple other remarks he made that stuck out. But when I teared up and we had that long heart-to-heart talk, I think that kind of set off an alarm for him — ""I'm seeing this person at work, I'm getting vulnerable with this person outside of work, am I ready to have this person so present in my life? After I just got out of this awful relationship?"" — that made him back out.  And it still hurt working with him. It hurt knowing I would only see him there, and it hurt seeing him laugh and be happy with other coworkers, because now there was nothing that made me different from them.  Finally, on June 11th, I decided that the line had to be drawn. I asked Luke for 5 minutes' time after our shift. Outside the building, I asked if there was any other reason that he had wanted to pull back to just work friends, as my last shot at exploring how he felt. But, ""yeah, I was really overwhelmed at work and needed to make some space. I do consider you a friend, though.""  ""Okay. Well... I think we should just keep it professional, because the truth is, I have feelings for you, and I don't think things are going to go in that direction... I'm sorry to do this to you, since you do say you still want to be friends, but I think it's the healthy thing for me, and I guess it does play into the whole thing about your boundaries, so I hope it does kind of work for you. But I just think this is the only way I'm going to heal.""  ""Wow, thanks for saying that. Um... yeah, feelings are complicated.""  ""Yeah.""  ""I'm... sorry I didn't pick up on that sooner, or anything.""  ""It's okay. It was out of your control.""  ""Oh, my Uber is here — I'll see you at work.""  ""Yeah, see you at work.""  *fistbump, initiated by him*  Then he said, ""Take care of yourself, okay?""  All I could do was nod, because if I opened my mouth, I'd start bawling. And then he got in the car and it drove off.  To say the rest of the summer was awful is an understatement. Various parts of my brain tried to convince me that I'd done the wrong thing, trying to convince me that I could somehow bargain my way back into his life, as I kicked myself for throwing away someone that wonderful. My friends told me that what I'd done was brave, getting it out there, but being brave is a good thing, so why didn't I feel good? I had previously cried in therapy maybe once or twice, but then I started doing it every week.  On July 3, five days after I nearly got my face ripped off by a dog, I had a crash on my scooter. I suffered a concussion, a decent bang on my shin, bit the inside of my cheek quite badly, and absolutely shattered my phone. Now, I am a hypochondriac, and I had also just seen a certain older relative for the first time in a couple years who had seriously declined, so the concussion was making me panic, barely able to think about anything other than developing dementia. As a result of my brain being a little rattled, and continuing to rattle itself with all these awful thoughts, I made a bad decision.  I made a little note and slipped it into Luke's backpack at work (in its external pocket for water bottles, as it was hanging on the same wall as everyone else's backpacks and jackets). It said,  >""IDK if you've heard (seems to be the office gossip), but I had a pretty good scooter crash lately. I'm mostly-ish unharmed, but it made me think about what could've been left unsaid if that hadn't been the case. I've been meaning to say ""sorry I had to say what I said while you were pressed for time"" anyway, since you didn't really get to respond. Having an adult conversation about what happened feels like something we could both benefit from. If you agree, please know I'm not asking for you to put aside the time and energy for this immediately, it can wait until you're ready. If you don't, I get it, and all I want to know is if you liked the song I gave you.""  (One of the last things I did before realizing I had to break off with him was give all my friends little cards with the name of a song and painting that I felt had their energy. It was mostly an excuse to tell him that he reminded me of a certain very gentle, sweet song.)  Weeks passed, and nothing happened. At first, I was just thinking that he needed to figure out what he'd say to me, but then I came to realize that I had probably done the wrong thing, and that he was upset at me for dragging this out and violating that boundary. There are a lot of things wrong with that note, but I think the worst part is ""an adult conversation."" It's like I'm implying that if he doesn't want to discuss it, he's being childish. But I was the one being childish by trying to contact him that way, and not being able to see in the moment why it was wrong to do. The concussion doesn't excuse it.  At the beginning of August, shortly after my doctor proclaimed me recovered from the concussion, I interviewed to also become Level 3. The interview was conducted by Sandra, our manager, and Maria, the department head (so, Sandra's boss). They offered me the job before the interview was over, and I was happy to accept.  At the same time, someone else from the office, Rachel, was leaving. Rachel was what I'll call a ""junior supervisor,"" a position that reports to ""senior supervisors,"" who in turn report to Sandra. Another junior, Jerry, was going on extended leave. This left the office with only 1 junior, which is bad because there's supposed to always be one present while we're open, and that was not doable with that person's schedule. Two hours after the interview, Maria came out of her office, *walked up to me, and told me to my face that I should apply for the junior supervisor position.*  Over the next couple weeks, Sandra and the senior supes said repeatedly, to everyone, in our daily meetings: ""No prior supervisory experience is required; training will cover everything. You don't even have to be Level 2.""  And so, two weeks after my successful interview for Level 3, I was back in the same conference room, and Sandra and Maria and I were in the same chairs as before. This time, they did not offer me the job immediately, which set me on edge. I scoured their schedules (everyone's is viewable on our scheduling software), and found no interviews besides mine and one other, with Chad, a really wonderful guy who'd been around much longer than me. I tried to convince myself that it *had* to be me and Chad, because I couldn't find any evidence of other interviews, and Sandra and Maria both seemed to have really wanted me to apply from the start.  Three days later, I encountered Chad in the breakroom, learned that he'd gotten the job, and offered my congratulations. I went down to the office, and asked Sandra lightheartedly, ""heyyy, you got any interesting news to share?"" She seemed hesitant, and said we should go into Maria's empty office to talk.  ""So, as you may have figured out since you haven't gotten any communication... we did not decide to go forward with you at this time. We think you're a good worker, and it was a hard decision, but we just think you don't have enough experience in Level 3 yet.""  This was a complete and blatant contradiction to how Sandra and the other leadership had been advertising the position's requirements. But that wasn't what was on my mind.  I swallowed. ""I need..."" I was tearing up. ""I need... I need to know... if one of the other people selected... was Luke.""  ""Um... yes, Luke has very limited availability, but he is one of the people we've selected.""  ""I see. Look, I... Luke and I... we used to hang out outside of work a lot... and I got feelings. I told him... I had to break it off. I'm uncomfortable with... reporting to him directly.""  If Luke and I had both remained Level 3, that would have been disappointing for both of us, but still a billion times better than having this imbalance where face-to-face communication would now be required. (I acknowledge that Luke would feel the same thing in my place, but he, I, and all other workers have to be honest about when a workplace situation makes us uneasy, and I just happened to be in that situation instead of him.) Sandra nodded, said she knew that these things happen sometimes, and offered to schedule us around each other. I declined, not wanting either of us to suffer a cut in hours.  When I got home, I burst into tears in the shower, then again when I got out, and I managed to explain the events of the past months to my roommate. ""I don't even know who to be mad at. I know logically that it's management, but every cell in my body is saying Luke, Luke, because I think sometimes our brains just don't know any better than 'this person is the reason I'm hurting.'""  The next day, I managed to put together some of my thoughts about being rejected for the job, and sent them to Nick. Our workplace is unionized, with the junior supes being the highest position represented; Nick is our business agent.  I explained to him that I was confused about why I'd even gotten the chance to apply for supervisor. It wasn't like I was going to catch up to Luke's additional few months of Level 3 experience in the two weeks between my application and the interview! If my lack of experience was going to be a problem, why did I even get the chance to interview? I felt like the whole thing had been rigged, and that we had been given conflicting information regarding how much prior experience was needed, and I wanted Nick's input on how I should voice my protest.  One part of the email I sent Nick was, ""To be clear, I don't think that Luke starting Level 2 and Level 3 before me is an inherently bad thing, just as I don't think any less of Lindsey for still being Level 1.""  Only a half hour after I sent that, I got into work. I logged onto the computer and checked my work email. There was an email from Sandra to our department, congratulating the three people who'd been promoted to supervisor. Luke, you already know. Chad, you already know.  The third was Lindsey.  Lindsey, who was still Level 1, when Sandra had told me to my face not 24 hours ago that my lack of Level 3 experience was the big deal.  I stood up a little in my seat. My jaw actually dropped, and I felt my temperature rising. I genuinely felt like I had been slapped across the face. I went over to Sandra's cubicle, and said in a tone I was fighting very hard to keep calm, ""You told me last night that I didn't get promoted because I didn't have enough Level 3 experience. Why did Lindsey get it, then?""  ""I don't appreciate you bringing that up in front of everyone. Come on, let's talk."" So we went back into the empty office. I have no explanation for how I was able to keep myself from saying, ""And I don't appreciate being lied to.""  Sandra completely walked back everything she had said the previous night. She claimed she hadn't meant to give the impression that my lack of Level 3 experience automatically disqualified me. So, just to recap, first it was ""no prior experience necessary,"" then it was ""lots of prior experience *here* necessary,"" and then, since Lindsey's time as a supervisor at a previous job was apparently the clincher, ""no prior experience *here* necessary, but lots of prior experience *elsewhere* necessary.""  Now, here's the thing: **I have supervisor experience from a prior job, too.** I have more supervisor experience than Luke, and more experience at this place than Lindsey. And, unlike Lindsey's, my supervisor experience *was at the same kind of place as this one.*  I expressed that I didn't feel like I'd been given enough time or questions in the interview to discuss this prior experience.  ""Okay. Well, when Maria is back in town, we can have a meeting and talk about it,"" she said.  ""Good. And I'd like for Nick to be there."" I then apologized for ""coming in hot,"" which Sandra was gracious about (""it happens""), and that was that.  Nick was also out of town for a time, so I had a few days to suffer by myself. I walked into therapy the next week, ready to explain everything that had happened, but my therapist, who I was seeing since November 2023, started off by saying she had some bad news. She was starting to shift more toward working with kids, and wanted to refer me to someone else. Of course that had to happen that week.  Losing Luke had been agony on its own. But losing Luke, upsetting him, having him swoop in from left field and get a job I really wanted, and then having Sandra go back-and-forth on *why*... that's something I've never felt before and never want to again.  Finally, on September 5, I was able to get a phone call with Nick. I restated everything that had happened with the supervisor job, my utter confusion, and the conflicting messages I was getting. He agreed that it was a strange situation, and said that I had the right to be upset.  Then he said he'd already been emailing with management to figure out a meeting time, and something else surprising: this meeting wouldn't be with Sandra and Maria. It would be with Maria and Bella — one of the directors of the whole organization. *Maria's* boss. I'd never spoken to her before in my life.  Two days later, after I saw Nick anyway at a monthly union meeting, he told me about some emails that had been going around between Sandra, Maria, and Bella. He had been CC'd into them as a result of my request that he be in the loop. And there was some incredibly unprofessional and flat-out untrue language in them.  In an email to Bella, Sandra apparently used a sentence that I will never forget for the rest of my life: ""I was given the impression that \[my name\] is trying to bully her way into the position.""  For years, I have struggled with the idea that others might find me intimidating, due to my height and unusual features stemming from health issues. I thought I was on the right track when it came to overcoming that image of myself, but Sandra's implication that I was trying to intimidate her brought it all crashing down. I have never said anything meant as an attack on Chad, Luke, or Lindsey, who are all fine people and good workers.  And I was bullied quite severely all through elementary, middle, and high school (yes, it was in part due to my appearance), and I have NO TOLERANCE for hearing that word used like this. Bullying is when two boys tickle you from either side so you can't get out. Bullying is when a guy tries to convince you that he went to your house on lunch break and killed your turtle. Bullying is when someone says ""hey, I just pulled a \[your name\]!"" after doing something they regretted. Bullying is when people make you twerk in the locker room. Being upset because you feel lied to and like you didn't get a fair shot? Not bullying.  Sandra claimed that I was ""confrontational"" during BOTH of my approaches to her. You read how I talked to her when I first asked if I'd gotten promoted; you know that is flat-out untrue. She also said, ""Based on nov21throwaway's approach to the situation, I'm confident that we made the right decision."" In other words, ""nov21throwaway was upset that she was given conflicting information about why she didn't get the role; this proves that she was not the right person for the role.""  My name has been dragged through the mud, in official communications to the second-highest person in the organization, for the crime of being visibly upset at being given wildly conflicting information multiple times.  The requested meeting finally happened on Friday, September 12. Nick, Howard (an older Level 3 worker who is in training to become a union steward), and I sat down across from Maria and Bella.  Maria's response to me saying ""you told me to my face to apply"" was to just go into a truly incredible ""I was just upholding DEI"" routine where she said, ""well, I think it's very important to tell people who aren't cis white straight males to apply for jobs."" Well, if you really cared about that, Maria, you wouldn't constantly misgender my trans coworkers, and you would hire more than one non-white person per year.  Bella said, ""It was not Sandra's intention to give conflicting information. You admitted to bringing up the topic kind of abruptly, and we aren't at our best when we're caught off-guard."" Howard would later say to me and Nick, ""They interviewed 4 people to fill 3 spots. HOW were they not prepared to have SOME kind of conversation where a person asked why they were left out?""  Maria went on a long rant about offering to ""coach"" me, and said that someone else had once said directly to her, ""I'd like to learn how to do what you do, and run a place like this."" She claimed to have put that person on the right path to a promotion. Maria ultimately did not give that person a promotion. That person was Rachel, the old supervisor whose departure kicked off this whole thing. As I was reminded by a former coworker via Discord later,  >""Maria openly scorned both Sam (former assistant mgr) and Rachel, up to and including telling Rachel to her face that she wasn't promoted because she 'didn't have any leadership skills.' To take credit for either of their success is somehow yet another layer of cruelty on top \[...\] I am not shocked that she is taking credit for either person's success. She has a lengthy, thoroughly documented history of mistreating staff that she doesn't personally get along with \[...\] while pretending to champion diversity in the workplace, and pretending to celebrate the success of marginalized employees when they manage to escape her. She's actually just happy to not have to work with people she doesn't like on a personal level.""  There is no logic in how people were chosen for this promotion, or how the qualifications were explained. Nor is there logic or honesty in how I have been spoken to, and spoken about, since learning I was not promoted. I do not feel that I have been given a fair opportunity, and I have realized that I am not going to progress at this place under this kind of ""leadership.""  I am done working at this clown show, but I can't find a way out.  The day before the big meeting, I had a Zoom interview at a similar place, just a quick thing with HR to go over the basics. I was invited to a second interview the next Sunday, the 14th, which seemed to go really well, with the person I would actually be reporting to. I was told I'd hear back by the end of the week, but there was nothing. My emails have gone unanswered. The week hurtled by because I was just waiting, refreshing my email, unable to focus on anything else. Why can't they just extend me the dignity of a ""no?"" It was a really good job, too, the full-time version of the one I just missed out on, with benefits and everything. Saturday the 20th saw me having a panic attack in the work bathroom and calling my therapist and begging her to take me back, which didn't work.  Luke is in training for the junior supervisor position now. Pretty soon, I'm going to have to report to him. I'm going to have the whole mess about promotions rubbed in my face by walking past a cubicle that has his name on it in official signage. I'm going to have to see him a lot more than I do now.  I can't do this. I would dearly miss most of my coworkers. Lindsey is a delightful presence, and Howard is such a strong and uncensored supporter for our rights as workers (and he approached me directly to say he was surprised and disappointed I didn't get the job, long before the meeting was even arranged), and there are so many others that weren't relevant to this post but are so kind and funny. But I cannot be in the same room with Luke without wanting the ground to open up and swallow me, I have no faith that that will ever improve, and I cannot work for managers that treat me like this.

As a kid, I asked constantly for my parents to help me or defend me against him. Either they blamed us both or told me to ignore him. I advocated for myself and got labeled the ""argumentative one."" Eventually I became a high-functionng but hypervigilant and anxious people-pleasing adult. In my 20s, I asked my mom why she never defended me and was told ""I knew you'd be ok, but I wasn't sure he would.""

I wore crawler earrings and she acted like they were obscene. I refused to give in to her and  insisted on my right to dress how I wanted within reason. I was the argumentative one. Now she's been divorced for a decade and is finally picking things she likes instead of what feels safe. She bought herself crawler earrings for her second ear piercing recently.

My first symptoms of derealization and depersonalization appeared when I was in middle school, and my life has never really been the same since. Even though those dissociative episodes don’t always last long, I am rarely in a “normal” state. The last psychiatrist I saw said that even if I treated some traumas, I’ve been like this for so long that my brain is now “used” to dissociating, and it shifts into dissociation after every small feeling of anxiety. I’ve seen many specialists — psychologists, psychiatrists, hypnotherapists… nothing has really worked, and as I get older I feel more and more swallowed by anxiety. It’s existential anxiety, to be precise: terrified thoughts about life, death, and the universe. Sometimes the anxiety becomes so intense that it feels like my brain is about to collapse. I can feel okay for a moment and then suddenly a panic attack hits and I’ll even have vomiting reflexes. I can’t sleep without light and background noise. I can’t go to the gym or do any activity alone without being invaded by dark thoughts. I can’t watch sad or philosophical movies/series. I can’t meditate or stay in silence — my thoughts race too fast and I get lost. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1nqfnsz,1758827414,2025-09-25T19:10:14Z,Anxiety,The dentist has traumatized me once more,"This is going to be super long, so I apologize in advance.   So recently, I went to the dentist to get some work done on my mouth and I’ve always had a lot of anxiety going. It didn’t help that I went to a new one, but they were closer to my new home, so I decided to check it out. I’ve accumulated quite a bit of trauma from dentists in the past. With already having anxiety disorders, emetophobia, GERD, and TMJ, it is an absolute nightmare sitting there for god knows how long. This appt ended up being 2-3 hours. It was so bad to the point that I was crying when I was checking out.   The next day, randomly, I started having massive anxiety at my desk at work. This popped up out of nowhere, and I didn’t even think of it at the time, but I’m assuming this is what caused it, as it happened only a day before. This has been going on for over 2 weeks now, and I am so over it. I have come a long way with my anxiety, to just be back where I was several years ago. I feel hopeless. I just had a baby this year, and she’s really one of the only things keeping me going. As it is, while I was out on maternity leave, a lot of drama happened in my department, and things just have been very tense all around. But, I trucked along, didn’t let it get to me, and I have two great coworkers that we just vent to. The fact that I have been back to work now for 4 months makes me think it was this dentist appointment that triggered it this time. For a bit, I was thinking it was due to all the tension in the department.   The way my anxiety happens is very strange. I have been able to notice a pretty predictable pattern. When I come into work, I am completely okay. I usually get there around 7:45-8:00. My anxiety typically starts around 9:30-10:00. I would say that it peaks between 11:00 and 12:00, but a peak would indicate that I come down from it. No. It just gets worse and more frequent as the day goes on. I do have social anxiety, so thought that maybe the more people left as the day goes on, I would be better, but I’m not.   Also, my anxiety is being manifested as needing to burp. But my brain is interpreting it as I need to puke instead. This is where the issue of my emetophobia comes into play. Just for context, my emetophobia developed due to throwing up in front of a bunch of kids in my school. So the vomiting  has always been the major issue with my anxiety. I’ve had panic attacks in the past, but thinking I’m going to throw up in front of everyone is what makes it worse. And I know it’s not regular nausea, because that wouldn’t go away when I walked away from my desk. But as soon as I walk away or step out of the building, I’m fine. Ugh. I just don’t know why my anxiety is being associated with my desk at this point. Today, I actually had to go out into a conference room to get away from that bad energy.   It is super frustrating. And just gives me a reason to hate dentists even more. I don’t know what I’m hoping to get from this, but just wondering if anyone has had anything similar, or any techniques. Believe me, I have tried many things - getting better sleep, walking, drinking more water, taking deep breaths, eating healthier, etc. A lot of it helps in the moment, but not when I’m anxious.

Well, that is me at the moment.  I had one rule about dating men: they had to be my age or older. This is due to several reasons, like maturity levels and my weird ick about dating younger men, even if they were a year younger. Probably from the years of reading YA novels. (Women do not follow this rule, but that is not important)  Anyway, I have low standards, and that bit me a few times in my backside. To say I am unlucky in love is an understatement. My last (and only) partner was ten years ago in high school. We dated for a month before he told me I was too boring for him.  Tried and failed through university. I attempted a few casual relationships, but always chickened out before I did anything. Not my vibe, it seems. And online dating was an absolute wreck. Never again  Anyway, last year I joined a Church and have Bible study once a week. One day a guy pitches up with our leader. I thought nothing of it. I knew he was younger than me, and because of my rule, I did not even consider him a possibility.  But four weeks ago, we had a quiz together and the way we just sped through the questions together made me feel things that I hadn't felt in a while.  Over the past few Wednesdays, my feelings for him have only grown. He is a cat person, agrees with me on queer rights, views on science and evolution and we are both absolute nerds. I haven't had a conversation with a potential partner in years where I didn't want to slap the nonsense out of their mouths. And being in a conservative-leaning church group where I am surrounded by interesting viewpoints, it is difficult to feel like I belong. He makes me feel like I belong.  I don't know if he is ""the one"", and nothing is worse than bringing out the ""God told me that we should be together card"", but it actually feels right, like he is here in my life at the perfect time. Except I am 25 and he is 22, and he is an accomplished gymnast, circus performer and dancer, and I resemble a rejected Teletubbies character..  I suddenly have severe insecurities. My SH scars, chubby legs... not to mention I live quite a bit further away than my groups of friends. They do stuff together at a moment's notice because they can and bond without me. What if he finds one of my best friends more attractive? Or what if he is a closeted gay man and we are only close because he feels safe with me and I have misread signals altogether? Or he has hang-ups about, as my friend so delicately put it, ""a couger"".  I am so scared to be rejected, because statistics are not on my side. I am afraid that the rejection might be the one that sends me to a psychiatric clinic. I haven't been eating due to this anxious tightness in my belly.

1nqfu0k,1758827802,2025-09-25T19:16:42Z,offmychest,I don't expect you to read all this lol,"**TRIGGER WARNING**  This is the story of my life – so far. I’m Ollie, and I’m 15m now. All the ups, the downs, the times I felt alive, the times it almost ended, the times I felt like I was merely existing. The unfairness, the trauma, the ecstasy, the need, the want, the emptiness. All here.  On the 13 of May, 2010, I was born to my mum Chloe and father Alex. My mother, with her long history of drug abuse and playing the good girl, was unsure about parenthood. Being only twenty-two, I can’t exactly blame her. My father, Alex, who also was a regular drug user and had been abused by his freaky psycho mother his whole life, was a schizophrenic only one year older than my mother. He had broken up with my mother about seven months into her pregnancy.  I obviously don’t remember the first two or three years of my life, save for a few strange moments. I remember telling my mum that a girl from my nursery, Ella, I think she’s called, was being mean, snatching toys, being rude, etc. and my mother brushing it off. I remember complaining that another girl, Ruby, was doing a similar thing and my mum said, “You know she has autism.” Teaching me that just because Sapphire was autistic meant that my feelings didn’t matter.  When I was about six, my mum got with a guy, Dan. I remember he was quite nice to me, but got my mum into swearing. So, so did I.  Growing up, I never really had any friends. When I was three, my mum became vegan and made me vegan too, which I was fine with until a few years later (which I’ll get to in a bit).  When the time came for me to go to school, she decided to take me out at the last minute because she had a bad feeling, and proceeded to home educate me. these where the best years of my life, and my mother often talks about how she wishes she could go back to them. I don’t want to go back to any part of my childhood, because she never saw the damage it did me. I’ve never told her, and probably never will.  When I was seven or so, I became angry with rules. I started eating things.  When I was about 8-and-a-half years old, I first heard about Covid-19. I remember sitting at my grandmother’s table, sipping her signature soup. On tv, the news reporter spoke about the rise of a new virus  which had killed about fourteen people in the last week or something. I was (obviously) a little freaked out, which my mother got mad at my grandmother for watching the news because she didn’t want me to know about Covid yet. At the beginning of the pandemic, my mother was cautious, but never gave me masks. At first, if we went out, we’d strip down and put all our clothes in the washing machine as soon as we entered and we’d put hand sanitizer on every fifteen minutes or so.  After that, my mother began doing some research, in which she discovered a whole menagerie of conspiracy theories. She fed these to me, of course. Told me that masks have nanobots in them that you inhale to make part robot. That the covid vaccine has dead embryo cells in it. That covid swabs had, you guessed it, nanobots in it. She got us “fake masks” with the filter cut out. She even got us “medically exempt from masks” lanyards in case someone asked us to wear one. In reality, she freaked me out more than if she just accepted covid. I was surrounded by conspiracies and people angry at the WHO and Governments, which instilled fear into my little 9-year-old head.  At one of the conspiracy-theorist meetups, (which she took me to, yes) she met… drumroll, please… Matt. Matt was about 15 years older than my mother. But my mother was in love. I didn’t like him. Back then, my mum was the person I was closest to, the one I always wanted to be around, and here Matt was, taking huge chunks out of our time. all she spoke about was him, his hair, his laugh, his body (which I didn’t need to know!). I remember rolling my eyes when he came over, feeling angry that I had to share.  Also, then Matt began to sleep in me and my mother’s bed. I had always slept in her bed, cuddling up to her and being soppy, etc. I did have a room, but the mattress was bust from where I had jumped on it. If Matt was there, I had to sleep in my own bed, which I had hardly ever done before. Plus, the springs genuinely hurt my back and made it ache, which wasn’t a priority to my mother and Matt. And, as the cherry on top, Matt slept naked, which was gross to me but my mother didn’t care.  I remember waking up in the middle of the night to hear my mother’s bed creaking REALLY loudly and my mum moaning REALLY, even louder. I knew exactly what it was, even though I hardly knew what sex was. I must have been about ten. And what does a ten year old do when she hears her mum having sex?  She cries.  I had burst blood vessels under my eyes that day. I felt hollow. But I hadn’t stopped them from having really fucking loud sex another three times (that I heard),  even at 8 am.  Another time, me and my mum had stayed up after Matt had gone to bed. We read a book or chatted or even just cuddled, and forty five minutes later we went to bed. Matt was mad at my mum for spending time with me even though he’d spent the whole evening with her. Apparently he expected her to go to bed with him. He screamed at her, and she screamed back. I was genuinely scared, I might have pissed my pants right then and there.  Alas, my mother stayed with him.  Matt (ever the conspiracy theorist) believed that the borders where gonna shut down and that there was gonna be mass inflation, and that we had to leave the country. My mum believed him and invested about 5 thousand pounds into silver (?) because that would stay the same value. Matt somehow managed to convince her to give up our flat, our stuff, our gorgeous cat Noel, everything, to move to Portugal. Apparently, there was a guy called Miles who was setting up a retreat space and offered to let us make it with him. We didn’t even really know him and it could have been a cult for all we knew. It actually might have been a cult, I don’t know. I agreed, as well, though, but I didn’t know better.  The day we left our house was 19 July. I said goodbye to my friends and off we went to France. We travelled through the Pyrenees’ through to France and Matt was really mean, punched some signs, almost punched a box of me and my mums stuff and my mum still stayed with him.  When we got to Portugal, my we were ghosted by Miles for ages. We didn’t speak the language and didn’t have any food or Wi-Fi. In the end, another mysterious friend called Nolan about three hours south, and my mum and Matt decided it would be a great idea to “visit” this man we had never even met. Luckily, he was nice and nothing bad happened.  Nolan actually introduced me and my family to a community (which I won’t say the name of) and we ended up moving there. it was really nice, at first. Matt was still mean and my mother took up a job in the kitchen, where she worked for a while for ridiculous hours. I was quite lonely there, because the closest kid to my age was four and and the rest where adults. I wasn’t allowed to go to school even though I wasn’t getting sufficient education, and I wasn’t allowed a phone or technology. In the end I raised about 400€ to buy a second hand phone, and since my mum couldn’t really take it away, I had my fun.  I would chat to people online, play games, watch p0rn, catfish people, stuff like this. Looking back, I crossed a line, but in fairness I did it safely. I pretended I was an 18-year-old girl and got photos of girls to send to people. I’m gay so I liked talking to guys. But I never sent photos of myself or my bits and I felt pretty responsible. I learnt about the act of sex when I was 7, heard it at 10, and saw it at 11. My mum and matt kept talking about it but wouldn’t tell me, so I looked it up. I remember clicking on the website and trying to understand.  Another thing I should mention is that at the community, there where three men who… took a liking to me. I haven’t told my mum or Matt about one of these.  First, Matt’s friend, lets call him Tiago. I would just be eating my lunch, I’d look up, and he’d be watching me. it gave me the creeps and I remember feeling uncomfortable. Another time I was walking past him and in the reflection of a window I literally saw him checking me out. I sh!t you not, he did the thing in movies where they nod and smirk. I was eleven and I went and told my parents, who shut me down. They said Tiago was a nice guy and that I saw it wrong. I knew what I saw and I didn’t forget.  Another time, my parents tried to protect me from the wrong thing. An old guy asked me to put sunscreen on his back and I did it because I didn’t think much of it. It ws weird and I was uncomfortable, but due to my social anxiety I thought anyone would be uncomfortable. I told my mum because I thought it was funny, and I didn’t think it was important and she got super mad with him and apparently had to stop Matt from punching him? Save the anger for when it matters.  I never told my mum about this, only my cousin, who’s my best friend. So, another guy was my Aikido teacher, Xander. He was cool at first, but I was the only kid there. I was talking to him after a session, just light chit chat, but he said “oh, in Australia, we call that a G-string. You’d call that a thong. Do you know what that is?” My skin crawled and I nodded. Another time I was playing cards with my friend Leonardo and Xander, and his daughter who was about thirteen. I started dealing out a new game we hadn’t played and Xander asks, “Oh, I’ve played this game. Isn’t it strip poker?” I look at him like, we are all children, of course it’s not strip poker. His daughter doesn’t even seem fazed, bless her. I can only imagine what it’s like for her.  That wasn’t even the worst. During a session of aikido, he asks me to demonstrate a move. This is kind of like an honor because idk, its fun to demonstrate. I left aikido after this, though, because he got down on the floor and asked me to straddle him and pretend to choke him. This might be a real move, might not, but I was really uncomfortable and then, to get me off, he did a pelvic thrust. I felt super confused and upset.  Since I never told my mum, because I as scared she’d shut me down again, I simply avoided him and separated myself from the situation. I learnt to protect myself where people wouldn’t.  At another time, Matt himself actually said something weird. We were playing a game where we called each other stupid ridiculous insults, and he called me a fluff muff? I was confused because one, he literally commented on my body in a way I was uncomfortable with, I DO not have a muff, and my mum was right there and laughed. I didn’t like that.   when I was 12-14, I really struggled. I was upset because I had no friends, no opportunity. I was bored. It felt like groundhog day. I almost unalived myself 5 times. I remember literally writing bye bye notes and holding a knife. I didn’t do it, though, and I don’t have any scars.  Also, Matt only got worse. He drove fast on winding roads, smashed plates, punched walls, even punched himself in front of my mum. I got used to screaming.  Then my aunt died. She had five children and was the “housewife” that looked after everyone and everything, the kids, the house, the shopping, the laundry. My uncle-in-law (?) did nothing really, except making money. My aunt who was only 38 died of a heart attack.  So, finally, me and my mum went back to England. I was happy for a while. My problems were minor; I suddenly had two friends my age, my cousins. While my uncle was an angry man, I was used to it.  Things got complicated on my 15^(th) birthday when my other cousin Chester lowkey started flirting with me. I was open because I push boundaries too and I didn’t give a fuck and was happy for attention. I didn’t think he was cute, but why would I? he was my cousin.  And before I knew it, I was curled up on him, my hand on his chest, his arm hooked under my legs, hand on my hip. My mum told me to get off him and I did, but he said, “but I’m cold”.  A few months later, I realised my uncle-in-law-thing was only nice because he wanted to sleep with my mum. When she turned him down, he relinquished all responsibility and began sleeping all day. it was only a matter of time before I found an empty baggie. My mum also found one, and a cr\*ck pipe on the children’s bed. My mum and my uncle got into a huge argument and he kicked us out. We went to my nan’s and my mum told my nan that my uncle was on cr\*ck and they called social services. They called me a “lifeline” to my cousin because I had her number and she was my best friend. My nan and mum controlled my conversations with her and I felt used. They constantly asked me whether my cousin had texted because “they had to know, in case.” They were being nosy, because I told them, if I ever get a bad text, I’ll tell them.  However, things got better. My cousin was doing better and coming around to see me. I finally started school and made a friend. I performed in a local production of Romeo and Juliet as Benvolio. Me and my friends are planning to go as stranger things characters on Halloween. I’ll be Eddie. I’m writing my story and its going well finally got a phone number on my 15^(th).  Life is looking up for me.  Sorry but no conclusion on the drama between me and Chester yet, and things are still weird between us but what can you do.  As far as I know my uncle is still on it.  Thanks for getting this far if you did. <3",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqfu0k/i_dont_expect_you_to_read_all_this_lol/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqfu0k/i_dont_expect_you_to_read_all_this_lol/
1nqfw9f,1758827949,2025-09-25T19:19:09Z,mentalhealth,Control Issues/ OCD,I feel like I tend to fall into the same issues in my life because of my control issues. I’ve been going to therapy for a while but have been taking a break for a bit and I feel like oddly enough it’s given me clarity. Whenever I’m stressed I try to control everything in my life and when I can’t I feel really unstable. Silly things like my partner being around when I sleep or feeling like people only agree with me because that’s what I wanna hear. For the most part the side of these tendencies that are productive (high standards for life and school) bring me a lot of praise from others but I feel kinda crippled by it. My therapist says it’s OCD related and that OCD is a disease of doubt and I feel that a lot.   But I’m here now because something so silly has flared this feeling up for me. When I left to class my boyfriend sends me a pic of his hair cut. Honestly I think he looks great but changes outside of my control always make me feel uncomfortable. My brain just spirals over thoughts I don’t believe. He cut his hair before and I can’t lie I did not like it but he told me before hand which helped me feel stable. This time around that wasn’t the case but my brain immediately jumps to “well he knew you wouldn’t like it so that’s why he didn’t tell you” which is not true. He probably just spontaneously went and cut his hair but the feeling of not having control makes me wanna just sleep through this feeling so I don’t have to deal with it.   Idk how many people on this sub relate to this but how do I even start working on this? How do I talk about it? I worry so much about being burdensome and he is so busy right now I don’t wanna give him something else to have to worry about. Especially something he has no control over now. I have no idea how to make myself feel better.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nqfw9f/control_issues_ocd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nqfw9f/control_issues_ocd/

I have been in therapy since 15, I have been on medications, I have been admitted. It doesn’t matter- I commit to getting better and then I lose it. I want to get better and then I wake up wishing I was dead. I don’t want fleeting moments of happiness, I don’t want to just “savor the good moments”   I want to feel happy and I don’t want it to take until I’m 40, 50, 60. Being told I’m not doing enough, or I’m doing things wrong, just hurts because I try so hard to be ok. It always comes back to rage or sadness- drowning in ways people have hurt me, drowning in ways I should’ve reacted better.   I don’t even feel passionate about the career I’m in school for anymore- but I have 100k+. The only reason I’m still here is because of my family, but even they don’t make me feel emotionally supporter, I just feel too guilty to put them through grief.   I feel like my entire life has been trying to be a good person, getting screwed over for it, then being blamed for being less of good person. I feel things so deeply, and I try my best to control it.

1nqg4nv,1758828488,2025-09-25T19:28:08Z,offmychest,I realised my feelings for a friend too late…,"I’ve been friends with this guy for a little over a year(I know it’s not that long, but I moved abroad not too long before that so I don’t really have long term friendships where I live).We got close fast and used to hang out almost every weekend, often going to bars together and just chatting shit for hours. We had a similar sarcastic sense of humour and there was just a natural chemistry there. People even assumed we were dating on several occasions. I thought my feelings were completely platonic (I had come to associate liking someone romantically with anxiety and difficulty talking to the person, but with him it was easy so I thought that meant I didn’t like him like that), and I unfortunately made it quite clear that I saw him as a friend, talking about previous instances where guys had pretended to be my friend and then made a move out of nowhere, leaving me feeling blindsided.   But at some point something changed. There was a drunk night, and he got , uh kind of ‘touchy’, putting his hands on my waist in a club. I gently shut it down without saying anything (just removing his hands), and we never talked about it after. I reacted in that way because I felt taken aback in the moment, but less so by what he was doing, and more so by the fact I realised I liked it. But he was pretty drunk, and I felt comparatively sober, and in the moment I was overwhelmed and didn’t feel like it would be a good idea to cross that line without talking about it sober in the light of day. But after that night I found myself thinking about him differently. I wanted to bring up how I was feeling in person but I was super nervous about it, and then life circumstances (travelling, family visits) meant that we didn’t see each other for a couple of weeks. When we saw each other again, he told me he was seeing someone.   I’ll skip a bunch of things that aren’t relevant, but basically now he is in a relationship that seems to be going really well. Of course I’m happy for him, but at the same time it hurts feeling like I fucked up and missed my chance to tell him how I felt. Based on several things I feel it’s pretty likely he did like me at some point. I also feel like I’m losing him as a friend. Some of the contexts we used to hang out in don’t feel appropriate anymore. I’ve felt him pulling back a little, and I’ve been trying to do the same and focus on other relationships and areas of my life, but despite my efforts to de-center him in my life, I just really fucking miss him. He’s still in my life, but I’m finding it hard to accept that things have changed, and that I’m no longer as important to him as I was at some point. I don’t think he has any idea how I feel, which I’m glad of, but it’s also hard to engage in a genuine friendship when I can’t let him know about this thing that’s been eating away at me and majorly affecting how I feel about our relationship.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqg4nv/i_realised_my_feelings_for_a_friend_too_late/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqg4nv/i_realised_my_feelings_for_a_friend_too_late/

I’ve been managing it better than I had over the summer but literally just five minutes ago that kind of ended.   I’m supposed to be eating certain things and staying on my diet because I found out eating a lot of sugar and processed foods contributes to my anxiety. But for the past few days, I’ve been binge eating snacks just because I sort of missed being normal and not having to worry about what I eat.   I was in the middle of making something that I wouldn’t really count as healthy, and out of nowhere I started getting this uneasy feeling in my chest. It wasn’t painful, but at the same time it was uncomfortable, and it was spreading from the left side of my chest to my back on my left side. I’ve been trying to ignore it because I know paying attention to it will make it worse(been there done that). But I just can’t help but shake this feeling of something possibly being wrong with me.  I feel scared and now I don’t even wanna eat what I prepared because what if it makes the pain worse? What if this is a heart attack? but I also don’t wanna waste food. I might just give it to my brother. I’m too scared to eat anything thats at least remotely unhealthy.  I wanna cry because I’m only 17. I want to be normal. I wanna be able to eat what other teenagers are eating without feeling like this. I wanna be able to go on walks and go to school and just go outside as a whole without feeling like I’m in a video game. I want to be able to live my life without worrying about whether or not something’s gonna kill me. The most I’ve had was scoliosis and my spine at the time was pushing on my organs, but I got the surgery when I was 11 years old. I’ve also had a small spike in my cholesterol, but it went away. I don’t know how to feel like I’m not dying every second.  I was just doing so good. I’m so scared. I don’t have my dad right now. I hate talking to my mom about this because she makes it abt herself…And my siblings make me feel like I’m burdening them. I just want to be normal.

To make things clear, I am not diagnosed with anxiety but am quite confident that I suffer from it. I overreact to the smallest things, feel nauseous when I wear earrings and the thought of them being pulled off and ripping through my skin crosses my mind. I try to take a moment to tell myself that everything is fine and that just because I didn’t perform to expectations doesn’t mean that I’m worthless and good for nothing, but the idea is infectious. I don’t know how to stop myself, and usually I don’t. I feel a weight on my chest and sometimes an unbearably uncomfortable feeling in my throat as if it’s expanding. I don’t know if this is normal, to feel everything the way I do. If I think for a moment that somewhere on my body could succumb to some kind of injury, my mind latches onto the thought and a tingly, beating feeling grows right in the area where the imagined injury would be. Maybe this isn’t anxiety, maybe this is something else. I just need advice for how to relax. I’ve tried breathing. I’ve tried going to a quiet area to just silence everything, but it doesn’t help because I’ll go right back into where I was before just to feel exactly what I was trying to avoid. Just for a moment I might feel relaxed but then I suddenly get this explosion of billowing sensation at the center of my chest as though my body is more predisposed to panic than my mind. That feeling quickly does reach my mind, but it always starts with something physical. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Usually when this happens, I don’t have a chance to really get away from it all if it’s something outward that’s bothering me. Other times, I just can’t retract my mind from an all consuming idea that slithered into my head. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to control that, but at least figuring out how to calm down despite an environmental factor being the problem would mean everything to me.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nqgnmy/advice_for_cooling_off_when_you_dont_get_a_chance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nqgnmy/advice_for_cooling_off_when_you_dont_get_a_chance/

I always thought that pepole were being too dramatic or didn’t went through enough shit to be worth claiming they were depressive. I went through a ton of shit in my life that were ""objectively worse"" than every single person I knew, and always thought I was sm better for not talking about it and moving on so easily without making it my whole personnality and never claiming that I have traumas. The irony is that now, after finally having managed to escape the chaotic life I had before, and having EVERYTHING I prayed for, I simply feel numb. Except when it comes to get angry or sad, everything just feels bitter and weird. It’s been more than 3 months now that I am in that constant state of denial, blaming it on the weather changes, capitalism, or anything really, except my mental health. But the very obvious truth (which even an 8yo could understand but apparently not me until now) is that traumas are subjective. Like, someone seeing their whole family get murdered could be SUBJECTIVELY AS TRAUMATISED as someone watching a horror movie. Depression, traumas, everything is just so random. It just sucks.

1nqh78b,1758831000,2025-09-25T20:10:00Z,depression,Boyfriend having a major depressive episode and is isolating and shutting me out,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years but we've known each other forever, 2 months ago he opened up and told me he was feeling very depressed we talked I advised him to try therapy again (he had been through that before and had a very bad experience with doctors therapists and meds) at the time when we talked he was slightly open to the idea but things happened and now he is deep down into the rabbit hole and its gotten worse.   We got into a huge fight I tried to fix it, I gave him time but not enough, when he was opening up again I pushed him a lot and we had another fight about a looot of things he basically said that I was being aweful to him and pressuring him too much, I admit I did try to push the more I tried to help the more it impacted him negatively, insisnting he does things to feel better insisting he goes to therapy, so now hes not talking to anyone, I am usually the only person he opens up to completely and hes not talking to me either, he is saying he feels a lot of pressure and wants to just escape everyone and isolate. He still goes to work and pushes himself but hes not eating well at all, not sleeping well, and not going out unless its work related.   I am worried about his state, I want to help but I can't do anything since I realized that me trying to help was me trying to control him and ended up pushing him away even more, now I am completely lost and I have no idea what to do, I thought doing nothing and letting him isolate for a while was gonna benefit him but we talked briefly and he said he wasnt doing well at all, and sounded worse than when we left things.

1nqh7ru,1758831036,2025-09-25T20:10:36Z,offmychest,I love my girlfriend but I keep questioning my attraction to her looks,"I need to write this because these days these thoughts are giving me strong anxiety. It’ll probably be long, but I want to give all the context.  I (23M) met this girl (23F) on a dating app about 7 months ago. On the first dates, there wasn’t any kind of “love at first sight” — also, I don’t believe in that, since love is never at first sight. Anyway, in the beginning I didn’t feel a strong attraction. She wasn’t really my type in terms of style and, in general, body type. But I liked her. I still think she’s beautiful — she has a beautiful face, eyes, and hair. Still, from the very start, I had some doubts about her physical appearance. Personality-wise though, there was nothing wrong. I liked spending time with her, she made me feel secure, and I never felt uncomfortable with her. She was also the first person I really felt comfortable opening up to. She taught me a lot of things — how important it is to communicate, to express how I feel — things I wasn’t really used to, since I never had that kind of connection with anyone before. I really think she is important to me. I think an important detail is that this is my first relationship, and everything I am living is new to me.  The first part of the relationship was a bit difficult, because I’m more introverted and closed off, and she was more diffident (because of her last relationship). But we managed to build what I consider now a healthy relationship: we listen to each other, we support each other, and every time she’s sad, I’m there to make her feel better, because I really like to see her happy.  But here’s the thing: as I said, I’ve always had some doubts — all concerning her appearance. I still think she’s attractive, and the sex has always been really good, I genuinely enjoy it. We’ve even done sexting a few times and I liked it a lot, I really desired her in those moments. We never had any big problems from that point of view. For these reasons, and also because the relationship has always been good, I’ve always tried to overcome these stupid thoughts and accept and love her the way she is, even though she’s not exactly my type. Because I really think it’s shallow to end a healthy and solid relationship just because someone isn’t exactly your type.  But it’s like an up-and-down cycle. Sometimes I think everything is fine, but sometimes I think it’s not. Sometimes I feel like I’m trying to convince myself to like her, like I’m analyzing all the good things just to find reasons to like her. And that makes me feel awful. Still, when I even think about breaking up with her, I can’t stop thinking about all the good moments we’ve had together, how important they are to me, and I end up crying. I don’t want to hurt her — she doesn’t deserve that. I honestly think she deserves the best.  I also think a relationship should be something you feel more sure about. Instead, I don’t feel that security. When I think long-term, I just don’t see her in my life. All of this makes me feel terrible, and part of the reason I feel this way is because I’m afraid I might be fooling her.  I feel really confused. Lately I can’t stop thinking about all of this, and I’m constantly anxious. I don’t know if it means I should end things or if these doubts are normal in relationships.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqh7ru/i_love_my_girlfriend_but_i_keep_questioning_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nqh7ru/i_love_my_girlfriend_but_i_keep_questioning_my/

1nqh9mq,1758831153,2025-09-25T20:12:33Z,mentalhealth,My inability to understand romantic relationships is ruining my friendships,"I don’t know how to explain it but I lack empathy when it comes to romantic relationships of others. I’m 21 and never dated, never kissed anyone or gone further and I have no desire to do so. When I picture my future I’m alone. I don’t know how to stop project that mindset onto others. Every time my friends talk to me about their relationships I get uncomfortable, I cannot talk about Sex with getting anxious shivers and getting teary eyed. I don’t have any trauma relating to dating or sex so idk where this might come from.   I lost a friendship when I wasn’t able to offer any comfort to my friend going through a tough phase with her now ex-boyfriend, I cared so deeply about it but it’s like I froze when she talked about him. She thought I don’t care about her feelings when it was genuine the opposite.   My best friend who is my favorite person and the person I care the most went through a bad phase in summer. She asked me if I liked the guy she liked and I told her that I don’t. I listed the reasons and unfortunately I was spot on with my statements. Now I regret saying it, I think it drove a wedge between us just because I couldn’t understand why she might like him. She’s not been doing well and I think that’s partially because of me and it’s sending me into an absolute spiral. She doesn’t text me first, doesn’t initiate meetings and doesn’t really look at me. It’s tearing me apart but if it’s the reaction to my own actions I’m more than willing to give her the space she needs. I just don’t know how to approach it. It sounds so stupid but we used to tell each other everything and now it feels like I’m being shut out.   I have a text in my notes that I thought about sending her but I’m so scared. If I’m right and it’s about my reaction to the guy and her relationship with him then it’s the second time I’m having friendship problem because of the same thing. Then it would really mean that I’m the problem.  Im not really looking for advice just a place to rant that’s not my note app but if you have something to say don’t hesitate to do so.
