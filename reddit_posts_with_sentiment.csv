depression,kcbaxe,My religious parents won’t let me get any sort of mental health treatment,"I’ve been trying to convince my parents to get some sort of treatment for my depression for so long but they keep telling me to “just pray” and talk to my youth group leaders about it (I’m not comfortable doing that bc I have social anxiety). My doctor first strongly suggested getting help for my depression and anxiety when I first started 6th grade (I’m in 9th now) and she keeps pushing for it and my parents still won’t budge. I’ve literally stood in front of them sobbing, begging for any professional help and sometimes they say they’ll do it but I know they won’t and if they do they’re gonna try and find a religious counselor/therapist and I can’t handle that bc I have religious trauma (bc of them). Idk what to do as I’m too scared to get outside help as my mom can get really verbally (sometimes physical but not extremely) abusive (she’s a narcissist and might be bipolar too). My grades are going down (I was a straight A student in the past) and Im back into my old habits of disordered eating, and self harm.

depression,1noo41m,struggling with my mental health due my education & career,"hey all. I'm 32M from South Europe I'm finishing this year my BBA but I got nothing no internship no job no experience and not network to land a Product Manager role. 

I'm considering medical schools since is other of my passions since I feel very stuck with my BBA degree (unless you have the network you'll stuck in the business/tech industry). My issue with medical career its that is gonna take 2 years to enter medical school, 6 years medical school, then another year to get into residency. So I'll start residency and my 1st salary at 42/43 years old while people at that age usually already have kids (I don't want kids btw), houses, cars, dogs, etc. I feel I put effort when I decided to study my actual career but I didn't get anything back aligned with my goals (i.e become PM). I feel behind everyone else even If I put the effort to study I got no results.

Now I'm really stuck with 2 careers paths. One trying to get into PM with a Master degree (still 0 network), or medical career that means I won't start an adult life until 42/43 years old earning my 1st salary.

My personality is also ambitious driven, I like many things, I have many dreams that obviously doesnt align well with the reality (stuck with my degree, wanting to pursue medical career). This is destroying my mental health: I struggle to sleep a lot, I got anxiety pretty much every day, I'm suffering from making mistakes thinking I made a big mistake studying my current degree.

depression,1ndz6e3,Mental health resources for an autistic adult?,"Mental Health Resources Specific To Autism?

Hello. I am wondering if anyone knows of any mental health resources specifically for people with autism? 

Long story short, I was receiving services paid for by vocational rehab in my state from the organization called AANE (the specific program was called LifeMap Coaching). Unfortunately, vocational rehab cut this service due to budget cuts in my state. I was told by my states disability services department that they cannot fund the service for me as they have a grant that says it’s for autism ONLY individuals, and unfortunately I have autism and an intellectual disability. Because I lost this service, I am feeling very lost and uncertain how to move forward, and it is definitely impacting my mental health. I am in therapy, but I only see my therapist once a week. I am also on medication but I don’t know if it helps enough. So honestly I’m just struggling a lot and it is impacting my anxiety a great deal. Some days, I honestly felt the life coaching was helping me even more than therapy! Basically, I met with the coach once a week and we would work on different goals and skills related to my autism and to help me become more independent. And now I don’t have access to it at all! This really sucks to say the least! 

If I am being honest, losing coaching feels very “unfair”. (Well, that’s probably not the best word to describe it, but it’s the word I can come up with in this moment.)
When I had coaching, I was learning coping skills for being a recently diagnosed autistic adult, and now that I no longer have coaching, I suppose I don’t know how to cope in this world, especially since it seems that this world is not made for people who are neurodivergent. It just plain stinks. That’s all I can say.

Furthermore, I can’t be the only person receiving disability services in my state that has both Autism and an intellectual disability. I am sure that there are other angry/upset families out there being impacted by this. 

Anyhow, I just feel really lost (and kind of depressed/anxious if I am being honest) without the support that life coaching with AANE provided, and I am trying to explore every possible avenue I can to get it back, as not having this service is taking a toll on my mental health unfortunately, and I am unsure how to move forward…

The BEST way I can describe it, is that when I was working with the life coach, I actually felt like I may be able to accomplish something in my life, and I grew to love our sessions together. Now that I no longer have coaching sessions with the life coach, I just feel that I am floundering in life, and I am not sure how I can learn to be successful, especially as an adult living with autism. I also feel that if I was diagnosed with autism as a young child, I wouldn’t be having these issues that I am experiencing since I was diagnosed with autism only last year. And I feel that me being successful has been “ripped away from me” in some ways. I just don’t know what to do. I suppose therapy does help somewhat, but it’s kind of complicated because it’s not geared at people with Autism, even though my therapist is on the spectrum. I have more deep feelings on this too, but it’s hard for me to put into words since I am so upset. 

I can’t stress enough how much life coaching really helped me out, and I don’t know what to do now that I lost this service. (If I am being honest, I have felt more anxious since losing the service, and I am unsure what to do.) 

Furthermore, I hope that my disabilities (especially autism) don’t prevent me from living a “normal” life. Other than employment and learning to live on my own, one major goal I want to see for my life is being able to get married and have a family (sometime in the next 10 years or so). If Autism or any of my other disabilities were to make that impossible for my life, I think I would be absolutely heartbroken and devastated (and probably resentful too). So I really hope that’s not the case.

I will try and hang in there, but if I am being honest it is very hard, and I am unsure how to best move forward with this situation…I wish I had more answers.

I am twenty years old and I have been struggling with depression and anxiety basically my entire life. Since I was a small kid I was anxious and even then I felt like there was something wrong with me comparing to my peers even though I didn’t know what it was exactly at the time. I put some effort into changing my mental state, but I was unsuccessful. I have been twice to therapy, once when I was around 14-15 and second time when I was 18. It helped in the moment but in a long run it didnt do much. I have tried a lot of different medications ( ssri, snri, some anti-anxiety , one mood stabilizer and some low dose of antipsychotics ) and none of them really helped me. At one point I was taking 225mg of Effexor with 300mg of lyrica and even it didn’t have much effect on me just made me numb. My psychiatrist told me that I am the only one whom he is switching meds because mostly he tries once or twice and it works out for most people. He told me even that he doesn’t know what to do with me anymore because he is slowly out of ideas. The worst part is that I suffer twice, once because of actual symptoms of anxiety and depression and second time because it makes me unable to have meaningful social connection in my life. Although I don’t even blame people for that because it is hard to be around someone who tends to be negative and angry so frequently.

depression,1n2kgir,Recent weight gain is taking a massive toll on my mental health,"Hello all. Sorry in advance for the long read, but I felt it was all relevant information. 

—-Background—-

I (25F) have a mix of Depression, Anxiety, and CPTSD. I am have been on Effexor and Focalin for about 3 years, and I started Abilify (2mg) after a bout in the hospital last October. I am in therapy and see my psychiatrist once a month. Generally I am pretty stable and functional. 

I come from a family that is hyper obsessive on health. My sisters and I have always had difficult relationships with food. In high school, I was really skinny, maybe about 120 pounds and 5’2”. From 20-24, I moved away from home and I hovered around probably 130 to 135 pounds which I was happy with. I was rock climbing consistently, eating healthy, and barely thought about my weight. I don’t remember the last time I weighed myself but I do remember just having a really rough time equating my body to a number so I haven’t weighed myself in a very long time. I started a new bartending job maybe last November and have been around a lot more alcohol since then. 

I started noticing a change around maybe January or February. Some stuff wasn’t fitting right and I went to the doctor for my annual and my doctor asked me if everything was OK. She told me I had gained a “considerable amount” of weight since my last check up and I can only guess it was probably in the 150s. More currently, I’ve noticed a decline in my physical stamina, some decline in my mobility, and now about half my wardrobe isn’t fitting me anymore. 

— Currently —

I’m scared to try on half my closet, I hyper fixate on how clothes feel when I put them on and it takes me so much time and effort to get ready. I am in a large life transition at the moment and I’m moving across the country and I’m having to pick out what clothes I want to take with me and go through basically my entire closet. It’s heavily deregulating to me and I would say for the last few months my weight is on my mind probably about 75% of the time. I hyper fixate on what I eat, anytime I do any physical activity, anytime I put clothing on, anytime I look in the mirror, it’s constant. When I sit or lay down I am constantly feeling around my body for new folds or hyper analyzing if it feels different than the last time I did. I spent hours scrolling through old photos of myself and comparing them to current ones. I’ve been researching weight loss medication and trying to convince myself there is some reason to all of this but it’s driving me up a wall.    I’ve all but stopped going to the gym other than the times I wake up so upset with my body that I badger myself into going and I feel like I’m thinking about eating all of the time. I been drinking more. 

It’s. fucking. exhausting. 

When I move, I plan to get back into rock climbing again, as I fell off of it when my job started at the beginning of the year. I won’t be living at home anymore so I can control what I eat and I’m just basically sitting and waiting to start my new life. I’ve been trying to get an appointment with my doctor before I leave but haven’t been able. 

I can’t keep doing this. I can’t keep just being disgusted by my physical existence. I feel complacent. I want to just give up and stop forcing myself to go to the gym and just let myself eat whatever I want.

depression,1mgowhx,My mental health has led to the breakdown of my relationship,"I'm not really sure what I'm doing right now. I feel so much guilt and regret and numbness that I'm not sure what else to do apart from write everything down. I have lived with severe depression and anxiety for most of my adult life, I was on medications at different times but hadn't been so for the last three years. I work in social services which is emotionally draining and takes up a lot of my energy. We've had almost half our staff leave since March (high turnover) and the worst of it came in July when half of our remaining staff were on annual leave. I fell into burnout and this turned into a major depressive episode. I did not do anything apart from go to work and come home. Didn't see many people and when I did, masked as much as I could until they weren't there. I didn't cook, I didn't shower, I didn't clean. I felt like a void. All I did was cry all the time and felt a crushing pressure to carry on. My fiance lives with me and this took a toll on him. I knew it did but I felt so powerless in my actions. I felt a real inability to do anything to make it better and I didn't know what I needed either. I was stuck. Just going to work, coming home and rotting. Three nights ago, my fiance sat me down after work and said that he couldn't do this anymore. He said that he was not happy and he didn't see this relationship making him happy. He shared he'd been on edge for the past month, not knowing what to do and not knowing what to say and that he was exhausted. He said that I needed real professional help and he was worried about me but he couldn't do it anymore. 
That was three days ago. I am crushed and i didn't think I could feel any worse. I can't sleep, I can't eat (more so than before) and I can't get my heart to slow down. The worst part about it all is that he is right. I have not been nice to be around, the constant bickering over the small things, the not knowing how I was feeling or what to do. He is right and I didnt realise it sooner and now the love of my life is gone and its all my fault. I wish I'd asked for help earlier. I wish Id tried to be more understanding, even if I was struggling. It feels like I had fallen down a well in my own mind and didn't realise what was going on until it was too late. I have so much regret and so much guilt. I want to fix this, I want him back but I think its too late. I've ruined everything. 

I'm going to call the GP tomorrow to get back on my medication and therapy because that's the only thing I can do. I'm so lost and so alone. I just don't know what to do.

depression,7agnoi,Just dropped my boyfriend off at a mental health facility..,"My heart hurts so badly. I didn’t want to leave him there but I couldn’t have another night of wondering where he is and if he’s going to kill himself. I cried so hard I could barely say goodbye to him. It’s only temporary but I am so used to worrying about him being alone.. he wasn’t supposed to stay there, he should be here with me and our dog. Instead it’s just me, my dog and his sweater. I suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses and I never had to experience it on the other side. He just got off the phone with me, 10 minutes goes by way too fast. I just need him to get better, he needs the help. This all hurts so much..

I just needed to vent, I’m sorry guys.

depression,1lmbpww,How do I stay informed without sacrificing my mental health?,"I cannot keep watching videos of what’s going on in the world. If I do, I’ll have to either sacrifice my empathy and compassion—or my will to live. I use tiktok a lot, so I find out about most world/US news that way and then go Google it to find out all the context/info.
I saw a video of someone attack a toddler at an airport and spent the entire day crying yesterday. I never wanna leave my house again. I don’t wanna acknowledge the existence of humankind. I just wanna hibernate until the world burns up or whatever.
I tried just not opening tiktok, but was so anxious about what could be happening without me knowing. Opened it again and saw terrible news. Started crying again.
I can feel myself starting to build an emotional wall tho. Not a filter, not a boundary, just shutting down any feeling of care.
I wanna delete tiktok and try to forget everything I’ve seen, but I do not wanna turn my back on the people who are suffering. I know how important it is to stay informed. Esp bc I consider my main advocacy skill (and purpose in life) to be educating people on current events. But I know if I keep hearing about all of these terrible things, I will absolutely snap.
I’ve tried limiting my news to certain websites and reading instead of watching videos, but they only cover so much. Tiktok has people talking about what bills are being voted on, what sneaky things are happening that no one’s reporting on, etc.
I feel like I’ll be sacrificing my mental health either way: depression if I follow the news, anxiety if I don’t. And I feel like the least I can do is to bear witness to the awful things happening and spread the word to try to get people who can actively help to do so.

depression,1lcjxci,Was this response to my mental health struggles insensitive or just honest?,"I've been dealing with constant breakdowns, and a lot of emotional exhaustion lately. Recently, I opened up to someone I trusted, just to release some of the weight I’ve been carrying.

This was the response:


“You're too caught up in your own issues. You act like you're the only one with problems. Maybe you're the reason you’re drowning—you're letting it happen. And now it’s starting to affect people around you. That’s probably why you’re always moody.”


Hearing that shattered me. It triggered another wave of anxiety and made me cry... I didn’t open up to be judged or lectured. I already know other people struggle too. I just hoped for a little understanding. Instead, I felt blamed for how I’m handling something I never asked for.

Now I regret opening up at all.

depression,1l3tx7y,"My parents think mental health problems are ""childish"" and ""immature"". I believe that for my entire life before going to a hospital by myself. How can I make them understand the severity of this issue that I have suffered for the majority of my life?","TL;DR: I went to a hospital and got 38 in Beck depression inventory, 69 Zung self-rating anxiety scale, 13 PSQI. My mental health has been this way for so long that, combine with my parents ""teachings"", I thought that it was actually normal. Recently, I started having suicidal thoughts and slowly realized that this is not normal.

My doctor seems to be very concerned about me and requested to speak with my parents. She promised that she'll make my parents understand and I trust her but I just don't trust my parents to understand. My biggest concern is my parents twisting this issue to fit their narrative and make things worse than it already is. 

Full story: I'm 22 and I have been in a constant state of sadness for the majority of my life. Sometimes, when I don't have anything to grab my attention, I can have a random burst of extreme sadness and I feel like everything is over. Sleeping at night became harder and harder due to these sadness burst. (Although it wasn't a conscious decision) My ""solution"" was to stay up late, keep myself busy and tire myself out as much as possible so that I'll be too exhausted to be sad about anything. At first, I had to stay up until 1 a.m before going to sleep but It got progressively harder and harder until I had to stay up until 5-6 a.m before finally going to sleep. I also start having less and less hobbies and live like an empty husk of a human. I don't like anything, don't want anything and I just live to do what other people require of me.

For years, my parents made me believe that I'm fine and I'll grow out of this ""childish"" and ""immature"" state. For years I thought that:""Of course I'm sad, there is nothing fun happening for me to be happy about!"" I remember feeling this way ever since I entered secondary school up until now. Also, my parents got angry (yes, they were angry) that I'm not smiling anymore and demanded that I be happy because they have put so much hard work on rasing me. Of course, I can't be happy on demand like that so I learned how to smile as convincingly as possible to get it over with. 

When I entered high school, I adopted 2 dogs and unknowingly to me, they have been helping me to cope with my mental health problems. Sleeping is still hard but it stopped getting worse. Everytime I got a burst of extreme sadness, just playing with or taking care of my dogs will calm me down. Also, for the first time in years, I was able to smile genuinely without having to fake it like I usually do. Unfortunately, my mental health problems didn't go away. All I did was to suppress and ignore them. 

At the same time, I also discovered my passion for video games as an art form. I take a deep dive into the world of single player games and use them to escape my meaningless existence. Now, I finally have reasons to live: taking care of my dogs and experience all the amazing games out there. They're pathetic excuses to live but they're all I have.

Fast forward a few years and my parents noticed that I'm still acting weird. They blame it on my dogs, saying that they're distracting me and stop me from growing as a person. They then tried to separate me from my dogs as much as possible. Also, my parents also blame video games for my weird attitude and forbid it. Now, I'm almost back to square one and all the mental issues that I've been suppressing start coming back and got even worse. 

My wake up call was that during a sadness burst, I planned my death and prepared the tools to do so. Then, my dogs woke up from their nap and asked me to play with them. That calmed me down and I realized that I'm unwell and needed help. 

I went to a hospital, spoke with a doctor and they recommended some tests to narrow down the possible issues for further diagnosis. Turns out, all of my test came back positive. I got 38 in Beck depression inventory, 69 in Zung self-rating anxiety scale and 13 in PSQI. That combined with the random suicide thoughs made my doctor concerned and requested a discussion with my parents. 

Now, despite their shortcomings, I still love my parents and I don't want things to get worse. However, knowing them, I highly suspect them to get mad at me for this and things will get even worse. I already almost killed myself at this point so If things get even worse, I don't know if I can stop myself in time when it happens again in the future.

depression,1l5xk20,My boyfriend struggles with several mental health issues (explained below). How can I best support him? Desperately need advice from people that are going through similar situations.,"Hey everyone,

I just want to start by saying this is coming from a really loving and hopeful place. My boyfriend means the world to me, and I want to be the best support I can for him while he’s going through some tough mental health challenges.

He’s been diagnosed with depression, psychosis, OCD, and spasticity. He spent about two months in a mental health clinic recently and is waiting to start therapy next month. Right now, we’re long distance, so I can’t be physically there to hold him or support him in person, which makes me feel a bit helpless sometimes.

He struggles a lot with anxiety, paranoia, and these really scary irrational fears that affect him daily. I want to learn how to be there for him in a way that helps, and I want to know how to support him with kindness and patience, without overwhelming him.

What I have been doing so far has been listening to him and check on him often. Whenever he has irrational fears, I take my time to explain why they’re not real and help calm him down. I try to distract him, make him happy, and make him laugh. I also encourage him to learn and research about his symptoms and diagnosis on his own, as well as watching videos about it together (suggestions are appreciated).

If you’ve gone through something similar or are in a relationship with someone dealing with these issues, I’d love to hear what worked for you. How did you or your partner cope? What should I be mindful of? What helped you feel loved and safe?

depression,1jtce0n,Mental health numbness,"Hello, I (23f) am newer to this thread. Recently, I’ve been in a mental health block. I’m currently medicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and ADHD. I’ve been through this loop before and somehow made it through it, but how do I prevent this from happening?

I lost a family member a few months ago, and I just lost my grandma a few weeks ago. I’m watching family members around me grieve, or at least trying to. My father doesn’t know how to grieve since this was his first death that hit home the most. He isn’t taking care of himself and is refusing any help. Granted, it’s only been a few weeks, but seeing him like this is hard. He’s a middle-aged man who was told he isn’t allowed to feel emotions because that’s “not what men do.” My family and I are trying to convince him otherwise, but that’s generational trauma for you. Heck, I don’t grieve people’s deaths, either. I don’t know how. I held her hand and sobbed as I looked at her. I was in my grandma's house a few hours after she passed in the hospital, looking through her things, looking for papers needed for the death certificate.

Before anyone says anything, I know how I handle my emotions isn’t correct. I often push most of my feelings to the back of my mind and wait for one final thing to take me over the edge, where I have a full meltdown over the multitude of issues I’ve been bottling up. Until that moment hits, I become numb. I sit there emotionless as I watch life go by. Others see it as I self isolate and no one knows what to do. They’ll ask me how I’m doing and if everything is okay, but I don’t have an answer because I genuinely don’t know how I feel. No one can help because I don’t know what’s wrong with me either. This is a repetitive cycle that continues on and on. I don’t even know what to do. I just want to sob so hard that I can’t breathe, my head pounds, where I shake, my nose is a faucet, and I have to gasp for air over and over again. Sadly, when I go through that, it makes me feel alive, that I’m still here, that I’m not in a constant loop of life, and that I can feel emotions other than numbness.

I don’t want to watch a TV show or read a book that makes me sad because, sure, that can work, but then I’ll overthink that book or movie, and that would be a constant loop in my head. I've been there, done that. I’m trying therapy again, but it’s been a while since the last time due to financials.

I’m unsure why I’m writing this, other than asking how I do not feel like this? How do I get rid of the numbness? No cliche answers of “go outside,” “exercise,” or “spend time with loved ones.” My loved ones are also depressed, and I can’t help them if I’m like this. I’m the one who helps others when they’re down, but I can’t do that because I’m giving up paddling the water below me. I’m drowning.  I’m tired of feeling like this or having this be so reoccurring. I’m tired; I’m exhausted. I’m tired of paddling.

depression,1hfui5k,Seeking Advice: Employer Might Cancel My Contract Due to Mental Health-Related Performance Issues,"Just putting this out there in hopes someone can share their experience or advice.

About a year ago, I (36M) was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. At the time, I sought professional help and counseling, which went well. I was on medication until July, and with my doctor’s recommendation, I stopped as things seemed to be under control. Since then, I’ve focused on living a healthy, active lifestyle—exercising 3+ times a week, eating well, limiting alcohol, and staying busy with hobbies.

Unfortunately, my mental health issues have come back, and this time they’ve impacted my work performance. I’ve been struggling with sleep, which has led to brain fog, and as a result, my productivity has dropped. I work as a structural engineer, so performance issues don’t go unnoticed.

A week ago, I sought professional help again and got back on medication. My doctor also prescribed melatonin, which has already helped improve my sleep. I discussed this with my employer, but they’re unhappy because my performance had already been low in the weeks leading up to this. My doctor gave me a 5-day medical leave (using my personal leave), which I just returned from.

When I got back to the office yesterday, I was handed a letter asking me to provide a written explanation of why they should continue my employment.

Right now, I’m feeling stuck. I’m doing everything I can to improve my mental health and work performance, but I don’t feel supported by my employer. I’ve decided to start looking for another job, but I still need to get through the next few weeks, especially over the festive season.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to handle this, I’d really appreciate it. What should I include in the letter to my employer? How can I approach this situation while still protecting myself professionally?

depression,1jnjy23,I don’t feel like myself anymore—could this be a mental health issue?,"Dear all, I need advice because my quality of life is really bad right now. I'm 23

Over the last four years, I feel like I’ve become a different—and worse—person.

Those years were filled with a lot:

Four intense years of engineering studies (I’ve now graduated).

Living with my mom who was deeply depressed, taking sleep meds that never really helped, and even became suicidal. (She’s finally doing better now, thankfully.)


During that time, I coped in ways I’m not proud of: watching p*rn excessively, smoking pot, and drinking at parties. I also struggled a lot with body image and low self-esteem.

Here are the results I’m left with:

Constant inner monologue and overthinking

Anxiety around people: I worry about what to say before, during, and after social interactions

Poor memory, forgetfulness, weak focus, and frequent brain fog

My mind goes blank around people. I can’t connect emotionally or think of things to say naturally

I live in my head. I’m no longer spontaneous, witty, or creative like I used to be

My thoughts are disorganized, and I ruminate constantly

Self-esteem and confidence are way down

I feel dumber, slower, and not as sharp mentally

I used to love socializing—it gave me life. Now it feels like a chore. I’m just surviving, not living


Funny enough, when I dream, I feel like my old self: present, connected, and happy. I want that version of me back.

One year ago, I decided to take serious action:

I fixed my sleep

I started exercising daily

I quit pot and alcohol completely

I went 100 days without p*rn. The first month was really tough, but then it got better


These changes helped—not so much with the anxiety around people to be honest, but they improved my mood during alone time. I also gained some confidence physically and felt a little more stable overall.

Nevertheless, something still feels off:

I still can’t connect emotionally

I still can’t socialize naturally

My mind is still overactive and exhausting

I still ruminate, can’t be spontaneous, and feel mentally slower than I used to

I still feel like I’m not myself

My confidence is still lacking

I still have cognitive issues—focus, memory, forgetfulness, mental clarity—all still weak

I don’t feel creative, sharp, or excited about things

I feel dumber and not as sharp as I used to be


And this is coming from someone who, before age 19, always felt smart, witty, and funny. Confidence issues were there, but not nearly as strong. I used to think clearly, joke easily, and connect naturally with people.

Eventually, I relapsed after 100 days of no p*rn, and I’m not sure why.

One time, while high on pot, I suddenly felt alive again—present, witty, spontaneous. I cracked jokes and connected with everyone around me. I felt like me again. And people noticed it too.

So I’m wondering:
Is my problem just a mindset/lifestyle issue? Or do I need to see a doctor?

Now that college is over and my mom is better, many of the heavy external problems are gone. All that remains is my job search—and whatever is going on with my brain and mental state.

I feel blocked. Am I broken forever? Or am I still here, just buried under something?

I’m willing to do whatever it takes. I’m a fighter. I’ve already taken steps, and I want to keep going. But I need direction.

Should I restart my no p*rn journey and go beyond 100 days, hoping it’s the root of these issues?
Or could this be something like ADHD, anxiety, or depression that requires medical support?

Please let me know what you think. I just want my life back.

depression,1jjpaun,Struggling with Major Life Decisions and Mental Health After Breakup,"I've been contemplating starting medication to help with my anxiety and depression. Since I was 16, I've struggled with decision-making, anxiety, and depression and often feel like I'm not living in the same reality as others. I’ve faced multiple crises during major life transitions—college, graduation, and now post-breakup—where everything feels catastrophic and overwhelming.

While I've maintained a good workout routine and attended counseling, the effort to manage my mental health remains daunting. The only time I felt at ease was in a long-term relationship, which recently ended. Now, everyday tasks feel insurmountable, and I wake up consumed by anxiety. Friends who take medication say it has changed their outlook, leading me to wonder if I need support to regain clarity and direction in my life.

I miss the confidence I felt when I was with my partner, and now I'm left questioning if I can ever feel content and independent on my own. I grapple with overanalyzing decisions, feeling paralyzed, and longing for the joy of just living in the moment. I'm pretty much seeking any insights or shared experiences on whether it's normal to feel this way after a breakup and if medication could really help me find my way back to feeling like my old self.",1,0,i've been contemplating starting medication to help with my anxiety and depression since i was i've struggled with decision making anxiety and depression and often feel like i'm not living in the same reality as others i ve faced multiple crises during major life transitions college graduation and now post breakup where everything feels catastrophic and overwhelming while i've maintained a good workout routine and attended counseling the effort to manage my mental health remains daunting the only time i felt at ease was in a long term relationship which recently ended now everyday tasks feel insurmountable and i wake up consumed by anxiety friends who take medication say it has changed their outlook leading me to wonder if i need support to regain clarity and direction in my life i miss the confidence i felt when i was with my partner and now i'm left questioning if i can ever feel content and independent on my own i grapple with overanalyzing decisions feeling paralyzed and longing for the joy of just living in the moment i'm pretty much seeking any insights or shared experiences on whether it's normal to feel this way after a breakup and if medication could really help me find my way back to feeling like my old self,0.1529761904761905,0.9571,NEGATIVE,0.9991918206214905,positive,positive,negative

depression,1ihvwiw,Working in mental health has worsened my own depression,"For the sake of my privacy, I will not state exactly what I do, but let’s just say I work in a very competitive environment that took me many years to work towards. I wanted to go into the field of mental health because I thought that I would be able to help other people through my own mental health struggles, but it turns out that this is only worsened my own mental state. I wanted to relate to people. I used to think that I was a very kind and understanding person. I used to think that I was a good listener. I used to think that I was good at what I do. However, every day at work is relentless and all I get is negative feedback from my bosses and my coworkers. I’m constantly feeling like my coworkers are getting praise while I’m just getting criticism. I feel like despite how hard I work I will get criticized for the one percent that I do wrong and never acknowledged for the 99% of things that I do right. I’m constantly getting feedback from people that I’m not friendly enough or easy-going enough. I’m tired of working my ass off every day and then having people tell me that “you just need to let go and stop being so anxious.“ Well, how can I stop being anxious when I feel like I’m constantly being criticized by everyone for every little thing that I say, or don’t say, or do, or don’t do. It’s like people expect you to work hard but NOT be anxious about it. Work yourself to death! But make it look EASY and do it with a fucking smile. My social anxiety is probably the worst that it’s ever been. I’m terrified of death so I would never commit suicide, but I do think about death a lot these days. I know it’s not the answer. I just wish that people would cut me some slack at work. I feel like I’m becoming burnt out. It’s really hard for me to remember why I chose to do this. I used to think that I had potential. I used to think that I could actually help people. I guess I’m getting caught up with stupid workplace politics, but it just feels like all I do is work my ass off. At the end of the day people just prefer the coworker who can shoot the shit with them while they just see me as a cold hard bitch. Nobody sees how I try to help my patients or coworkers. All they see is that I’m introverted. On top of that I’m constantly getting spoken over and nobody ever listens to me. It drives me crazy when I have to repeat myself because the other person wasn’t paying attention so additionally, I am made to feel stupid and unappreciated. I’m just so tired and overworked. I’m tired of this job because it’s only made me more depressed. I started taking antidepressants, but they’re not working. My insurance sucks so I can’t afford a therapist nor do I have time to find one plus it’s even more difficult to find a therapist when I work within the field of mental health without risking my privacy. I guess what I’m feeling is a combination of imposter syndrome as well as burnout.

It’s not an excuse of course because of mental health, though I had 2 very short jobs in between those years but only lasted a month or month and a half for one and the other it was too stressful I didn’t last more than 2 weeks. I feel like my days are a total waste at least especially when I’m at my parents house because I don’t drive and they are 30 mins to the first bus but they don’t like me walking it because it’s a little dangerous up a big uphill with a thin sidewalk line next to cars passing by fast with a downside that can cause you to fall into a deep forest downhill. I can’t do as much when I’m there and visit a few days out of the week, but I help around the house and try to keep busy but sometimes I’m just on my phone too much. But when I’m at my apartment that’s about 8 mins away I’m right outside 2 mins to transit and am a lot more active gone most of the day at least volunteering or doing other things, appointments or going to a mental health resource support activity and classes clubhouse. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of years and feel like I’m not good enough or a waste of space compared to my bf who has a job and people who manage to work 2 or 3 jobs at a time when I can’t even manage one. I developed weird phobias or anxiety about even basic jobs like fast food and retail/ customer service, restaurant waitress, worried about things like grocery codes, food prep/ clumsiness with wrapping or packaging things etc or memory remembering food items or orders, or cashier working with money etc. Idk if it’s just lack of experience not having a job over a year or not having many jobs in my teens / young adults years. I’m trying to work with a job counsellor to get back into the work force or go to college for the first time. I feel like I’m the only one and like I’m not good enough in society like I’m a burden. I’m on disability since a year ago and I feel guilty sometimes though it will help me with anxiety and mental health accommodations for college if I go and other access to job trainings. I’m also worried because my bf who lives in Japan, I live in Canada is telling me that I should come on a working holiday visa in Japan for 1 year and I don’t think I’m strong enough resilient or able to do it. I want to stop spending my days doing nothing at least when I’m at my family’s house, I was going to the gym everyday before but haven’t since I got sick.

depression,1hphg5i,Moving to New England Destroyed My Mental Health,"To preface this rant, there are some parts of NH I like, such as the weather and some of the towns like Portsmouth.

Initially, I moved from the South to New Hampshire thinking it would be an improvement and a change in pace that I needed in my life. I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety and thought the slower pace would help, as well as the fun new atmosphere. Very quickly I learned I was wrong.

People here are mean as hell and just generally shitty and disloyal. I'm a gay man and was actually looking forward to living in a state that was safer, as well as having a statistically large LGBT population. Don't fall for numbers people... it's sparse. Dating was a fucking nightmare, as the men are severely exclusionary and cold. Alternative, the older guys are incredibly predatory and will take advantage of you. Everyone I would try to date would ditch me to hang out with their richer friends that they could gain from. This trend also continued with friendships, of which I have none. Never in my life have I moved somewhere where I felt so invisible despite being fairly outgoing. If you aren't a rich asshole that is skiing every weekend and throwing parties in the house you bought at 21 with your trust fund, or weren't raised here, you'll have fucking no one.

The food sucks, I suppose the only positive is that I dropped like 20 pounds living in New England because the food here is so bland and miserable. It's shocking to watch coworkers shovel the most heinous, flavorless slop disguised as Mexican food into their mouths and proclaim how good it is.

This state drove me to suicidal thoughts on several occasions, as well as heavy drinking. Everyone is so rude and unsupportive, including the nearly non-existent mental health resources. Imagine trying to cheer yourself up with some self care activities only to have a door shut in your face and people shove past you and glare at you. People here have no fucking manners. I see why New Hampshire has one of the highest alcoholism rates in the United States, as well as a very visible problem with hard drugs. It's miserable and depressing to live here if you aren't rich and ALWAYS outdoors.

I’ve recently gone to rehab and as of today, I’m 70 days sober. I’m curious what movies and TV shows do people relate to when it comes to mental health. Personally, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been my go to for its depiction. Other shows like Mr. Robot, and at times The West Wing have been comfort to me as well as movies like The Hours and Amy (the Amy Winehouse documentary) have been true and raw examples of depression.

depression,1feq3ej,Weed and mental health. ,"I started smoking weed very occasionally at first. Until I started spending time with an ex friend of mine who got me in to smoking daily after work. It was all the damn time and I started to build a dependency. I reached a point where I smoked weed even during working hours where I promised myself I will never do. I started making mistakes at work , dealing with brain fog, exhaustion and paranoia. I quit for 9 months and got back to it again. This time I was super dependent and couldn’t put it down. Depression and work burnout hit me hard and I had to be signed off work for 7 weeks. 

I have an anxiety disorder , depression and PTSD way before I started smoking weed. When I smoke , my mind wonders and I start to remember all of my trauma. It’s like it’s opening a door of misery that I never want to open. It builds so much awareness and no room for dissociation to numb my mind from my trauma. It becomes so much that I end up with low mood the next day. The beginning of a high is always nice , dopamine goes high and I’m happy however the effects of it hit me after when im sober. It’s like drinking. When I drink , I am happy but when I’m sober the next day , I am extremely depressed. 

Does anyone relate? Can anyone explain to me why this happens ? I love weed and I don’t want to give it up completely, it helps to calm my anxiety down and makes me happy which I haven’t felt in a long long time. I don’t smoke everyday anymore. I don’t even smoke on the weekends anymore either. I only do it on occasions but I want to go back to smoking only one day a week or two days a week. But I want to know why this happens and why it’s triggering for me. I sometimes get PTSD flashbacks while I’m

depression,1h856vq,Losing myself and my mental health,"Feels like my life has been tanking since my wife was laid off of work in May of this year. She's a project manager in customer service industry. She was laid off due to downsizing and jobs being shipped overseas. I come from a middle to low class family. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school. I've worked hard my whole life for any and everything. I've never had a handout or help from anyone. Any successes I've had in life have come from working hard and saving. Now she is resorting to jobs she is over qualified. She get turned down from those jobs for that reason. 

My wife has been trying to land a new job for the past 6 months with no success. During those months I've done everything I can to stay positive while watching all of our savings go down the drain to pay our bills. I don't have much and seeing the little we have go so fast has been so discouraging. I credit my wife for also staying positive. Unfortunately I feel she doesn't want to face the truth that we won't be able to pay our bills in another month or two. I look back at how hard I've worked and how little I have to show for it. 

I feel like everything in life is always hanging on by a thread and everything comes crashing down when that thread can't take it anymore. 

I know my problems are small compared to others. It still has me feeling depressed every day I wake up. Wondering when something is going to change. 

I wake up with anxiety every morning fearing my job, if I will fail today, if my bosses will fire me, now my wife's unemployment is just another cherry on the crap sundae my life feel like. 

Thanks to anyone who reads this. Sometimes just having someone listen and not judge goes a long way. I don't have friends, no one I can vent with.

depression,i2h6dv,"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act","Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

depression,1hemv7d,Extreme mental health issues. Help UK - Scotland. Support and Benefits.,"I’m struggling with severe mental health issues that have deeply impacted my daily life and ability to function. About four months ago, I had a major mental breakdown that triggered intense anxiety and panic attacks. To manage these, I began taking antidepressants. During this time, I’ve also completely isolated myself from social interactions, except for my partner, who has been my only support.

She has taken on full responsibility for caring for me. She does the shopping, ensures I maintain my hygiene, prepares my meals, and makes sure I don’t skip medications. I can only leave the house if she’s with me, as going out alone triggers severe anxiety and panic attacks, leaving me paralyzed. This has been one of the most difficult periods of my life, especially because, before this, I was an extroverted and positive person who always went the extra mile for others, even while facing personal struggles.

The cause of my mental health issues stems from years of exposure to toxic environments. I spent over a decade in workplaces where I experienced physical and emotional bullying, harassment, and a lack of support from HR and management. When I reported incidents, they were often swept under the rug, or I was ignored, targeted, or even punished for speaking out. The situation was worse when the bullies were supervisors or company owners, as nothing was ever done to address their behavior.

Adding to this, my brother has repeatedly spoken about ending his life, even setting deadlines for it, which caused me enormous emotional stress. These combined factors have left me feeling hopeless, useless, and completely burned out. I’ve lost interest in everything I once enjoyed, such as video games, meditation, and outdoor activities. Only recently have I started playing video games again, but it’s the only activity I can manage or enjoy right now. I feel disconnected from people, society, and the world as a whole.

Despite thinking time might heal these wounds, I still struggle daily with my mental health. I’m entirely dependent on my partner for basic tasks, and I’m incredibly grateful for her unwavering support, especially since she asks for nothing in return.

Seeking Advice on Financial Support:

We live in Scotland, and I’m looking for information about financial benefits or support for my partner, as she is my full-time caregiver. She works 35 hours a week, but English is not her strong suit, making it difficult for her to navigate these systems.

Specifically, I’d like to know:

What benefits or financial assistance might she be eligible for through Universal Credit?

If I’m confirmed as mentally disabled by a professional, how might this affect her eligibility or the amount she could receive?

Roughly, how much support could she expect to get weekly as my caregiver?

depression,1ecy1d9,Feeling Invalidated by My Wife's Comments About My Mental Health—How Can I Reframe My Mind and Cope?,"I've (M32) been married to my wife (F29) for about 7 years, and we have a 1-year-old son. Both of us have demanding careers, and our marriage has been rocky since about a year before our son was born. Although he wasn’t exactly planned, we both love him dearly.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I'm currently on medication and have done years of therapy, but nothing truly ""cures"" my depression. Unfortunately, I attempted suicide as a teenager, and in some ways, suicidality has been a coping mechanism for me.

Balancing the roles of supportive husband, father, and maintaining my career makes me feel like a constant failure. My wife often reminds me of how far behind I am.

Last week, we had a severe argument in front of our child, which I'm deeply ashamed of. During our heated exchange, my wife said something that has deeply hurt me: she told me I don't truly have anxiety and depression because I still enjoy hobbies. As a physician, she said I should understand that my mental health issues are just excuses for not doing what I need to do in life (like exercise, discipline, and diet) to be happier.

Her words broke me. On one hand, I acknowledge that raising our child is challenging, and she sometimes resents me for not having the same responsibilities as she does. On the other hand, her invalidation of my mental health has made me feel completely alone and unsupported. As a doctor, discussing suicidality is complicated and could be career-ending if it were known.

I've never told my wife this, but since suicide was an escape for me as a teenager, I’ve often ruminated over the thought. I've written more suicide notes than I’m proud of, including one for my son.

I’m aware that the common advice is to seek therapy, which I understand. However, I'm struggling to find motivation to pursue it. My wife's statements have made me feel guilty for my condition and have diminished my willingness to share anything with her. I fear becoming the typical modern male who gives everything but receives nothing in return, expected to be flawless and without mental health issues.

depression,1gybk2r,It sucks when you’re black undiagnosed/misdiagnosed with mental health issues…,"Long story, looking for someone who might relate and know next steps? 

I [21] female have been struggling lately (per usual). Mental health has been a constant battle for me since I could remember (which I barely do). I have plenty of signs (from doing research):

- dissociation, derealization, insomnia, mild panic attacks, extreme fatigue, mood swings, triggers, hyper focus, lack of focus, hopelessness, lack of motivation, suicidal thoughts/tendencies, flashbacks, sh, burnout, crashing tf out, etc. 

In the past few years I’ve grown to validate my experience and look for help as this has affected my life and capabilities. It has always been hard for me to recognize something is actually “wrong” I come from the black community which barely believes these things are real or have much affect. So I’ve just been called crazy, irrational, annoying, “too much” and “slow” all my life. 

After a year of self discovery when I turned 18-19 I dedicated myself into healing even without any support. I had a spiritual awakening which put my in an all time high to confront traumas and my neurodivergence with more compassion and acceptance. This helped for a while but then I underwent a few traumatic experiences (again, my life is full of them) in 2021: 

My big brother passed (father figure) after battling cancer for a year.
I was displaced 3 times and ended up homeless for a while.
I had gotten into a physical altercation with my family and had to call 911. 
My 4 year relationship ended. 

Dark night if the soul hit hard huh… lol. 

I saw my first psychologist in 2023 after getting myself in a better place psychically and somewhat mentally (not really cause I’m very high masking and fluid/numb in my expressions) and was (what I believe to be wrong) with Bipolar 1 after a 30 minute session. Immediately I was prescribed antipsychotics and depressants but I refused to take them. 

Context being i am a very hyper/selfaware person with a family history of mental health issues. I believe they assumed my issue was Bipolar 1 because my mother is diagnosed this way and we’re both females of color. It’s so easy to overlook my neurodivergence or depression or anxiety. Basically a waste of a professional diagnosis. The help I worked so hard for (because I don’t have insurance or easy commute) was blown in 30 minutes. Again I felt as if I wasn’t seen and labeled crazy. I also believed my mother may be misdiagnosed and is on the spectrum. 

Overall it’s hard to get taken seriously. Starting to believe maybe I am “dramatic” or “delusional” and feel like giving up. It’s funny though cause every time I reach this point of feeling alone I’m usually my closest to commit. I’ve only ever tired once… 6 years ago and I failed and I was still alone. I’ve always been the person to pick myself up so people assume I’m strong. I’m genuinely scared for the day I’m not strong enough… and these feelings come back stronger every time.

depression,1ga96o9,"I travel to delete myself. This trip has compounded my mental un-health. Numb to worry, heightened to pain. ","It's now 8:37 in Kanazawa in Japan. This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I've been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn't dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don't really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should've stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I'm so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can't tell by these words but I'm a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I'm more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I'm losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. 

Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer ""immediate"" effect from it, is the fact that...I'm cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn't plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven't done anything extravagant. I didn't get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I'd pay for). I didn't eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I've spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don't know how it's possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there's absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It's driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don't think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It's like I did it all in a blackout and didn't get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom's money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven't a clue where so much of it went and it's killing me.

So that's my little story. I've been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn't have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn't help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She's the reason I haven't left here yet, because I know it'd destroy her. 

It's raining in Kanaza now, dress shoes splash through the puddles, empty cabs are flying by, I'm eating expensive matcha algetto, a family is walking their dog across the way and all I can do is fight looking at my reflection in the cafe window, trying to hear only the sound of a language I can't comprehend in the hopes of distracting me from myself.

depression,1gb12rg,"Struggling with Mental Health, Family Issues, and School Challenges - Seeking Advice and Support","Hello, Reddit community,

I’m reaching out because I’m currently navigating some tough times with my mental health and family dynamics, and I could really use your support and advice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, which has affected my ability to attend school regularly. I’ve been working on my healing journey, and things have been improving, but I still have a long way to go.

Recently, I was asked to come to school to sign up for an important exam. The situation has been complicated because the last time I interacted with the vice principal, I shared my mental health struggles with her, hoping for understanding. Instead, she dismissed my feelings, saying, “It can’t be you; you don’t have any illnesses,” and even went so far as to insult my family. This experience left me feeling humiliated and has made me dread the idea of going back.

On top of this, I’m also facing significant challenges at home. My mom often disrespects me, body shames me, and seems to favor my cousins over me. She talks negatively about me to other people, which has made me feel unworthy and has taken a toll on my mental health.

Now, I feel stuck between wanting to move forward with my education and the anxiety that comes from facing someone who has treated me so poorly. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow, but I’m worried about the implications for my exam.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced similar challenges—how did you cope with unsupportive school environments and difficult family dynamics? What steps did you take to prioritize your mental health while still pursuing your education? Any tips for communicating with school authorities or handling difficult situations would be immensely helpful.

I suffer from depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. I live alone. I'm not close to my family and have no close friends (mostly by choice because I don't really get the appeal of friendship).

I have cancelled half a dozen doctor's appointments/therapy sessions (booking them was progress for me) in the past two years because i just don't have the energy to do them, even if i know they would probably make me feel better.

A lot of people recommend doing online therapy but unfortunately I'm extremely uncomfortable with basically inviting a stranger into the only place I feel truly safe in. Going outside for online sessions feels counterproductive. 

It just seems like no matter what I try and no matter how far I've gotten, there's always an opposite force in my head that's telling me to give up.

depression,1e3s1gh,Struggling with jobs and mental health. ,"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I’m 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I’d found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can’t cope - I feel it’s impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I’m looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there’s been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren’t right and it’s just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it’s never good enough and it always goes wrong. I’m just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.  

The GP offers little support and CMHT refused to take me on or even assess me, so I’m at a loss of where to turn. My partner is very supportive but I don’t want to put too much on him either, as it’s not fair at all.

depression,1f9vtkd,Why do doctors always dismiss mental health ,"I have been struggling more than I ever have with my depression. Typically I’m high functioning. The last few months have been extremely awful. I hardly sleep, I’ve gained a ton of weight, I hardly shower or brush my teeth. I’m literally disgusting. I work from home so nobody has to see me, but I have such extreme brain fog and low motivation that I can barely do anything let alone focus enough to work, not to mention the extreme stress and pressure I’m under at work right now (software engineer). 

I was about to just cold quit until I found out about FMLA and requested it as soon as I could. Of course there were passive aggressive comments at work about it but overall it went better than I expected. I started seeing a therapist, trying to work on coping skills, trying to actually do small self care things in the day. 

Well, my therapist wouldn’t sign my paperwork. Said it needed to be a doctor and said I should go to my primary care physician. I did that, and I regretted it. 

I told the doctor why I was there, said I needed FMLA paperwork completed. She asks why I need it, I end up crying right there while explaining my symptoms. She then proceeds to say I don’t need FMLA because depression and anxiety are very manageable, and just prescribed me Zoloft. She said that I need to keep working and contribute to society. And that if I just sit around at home doing nothing all day, I’ll become suicidal. 

I was crying and like had no idea what to say (especially because the way my therapist phrased it was that she would just sign it with no problem). I just said ok and left. 

I felt so dismissed. Work is literally making my depression worse actively. I am not being productive at work and I know it. I already lay here doing nothing all day, that’s the problem. I already don’t have a purpose, my purpose isn’t to work for a rich corporation. Why does it matter to her? I’m sitting there telling all this embarrassing and vulnerable stuff to someone I don’t even know, and then get told “eh suck it up” as if I haven’t been sucking it up for years of my life. As if she looked at me and just made the conclusion I want to go on some vacation. I feel like, how can you make this decision for someone like this?

I’ve tried calling other doctors, I can’t get in anywhere in time before the paperwork deadline. Looks like I’m going to have to just quit my job and make peace with being unemployed at this point. I just keep ruining my life more and more and I can’t stop.

depression,1dx35g8,Mental Health in a Rural Community,"I lived in a larger city for years before meeting my husband and moving to be with him. Now I live in a village of 1,000 people and everything is everyone's business. There are only so many medical facilities within an hours drive and there is always someone's brothers cousins sister there who talks about who they saw in the waiting room. This alone has been a MAJOR culture shock. 

I have depression, anxiety, and a nice gift of ptsd as a gift from an ex. For a while, I thought I had a handle on it. I went to therapy on and off for years, I've been on medication (citalopram) for almost 8 years, and I keep a set workout schedule. But, I've found myself slipping back to a place that's hard to admit out loud. I've voiced my situation to a loved one here and they don't seem phased. ""Well, you seem ok."" Thanks, I'm really good at hiding that I hate myself. I've been doing it for decades. 

I feel the depression sinking it's claws into me like a physical weight in my chest. And when it's gone and I feel joy it seems so over the top that once the moment has passed I hate the person who showed so much passion. I wish I could keep her tucked so so far away. I would almost rather live in my depressive haze than have to pull my joy back in anymore.

depression,1ea16u8,rebuild your life in a bigger city has it improved your mental health?,"Hello everyone :)

I'm a 23 y/o female living in Ottawa, Canada, and I’m thinking about moving for the first time on my own 400 km away to a bigger city, Toronto.

I arrived in Canada almost 5 years ago with my family from Europe. Our arrival in the country was brutal due to family and financial issues which I still have traumas for. My family is conservative and even back home they rarely allowed me to have a social life outside the church community. When we arrived here in Ottawa after a few months Covid-19 happened which increased my social anxiety to where at some point I couldn’t get out even of my room due to depression and social anxiety. I’ve got much better now but my down moments can be really bad at time. This year I’m finally feeling the motivation to change my life, I’ve started taking care of myself more and tried therapy which I stopped after a few months because it felt to painful to face my traumas during the sessions and then go back to my family which is one of the main causes I’m in this situation right now. I’ve worked in so many different fields but I feel like hospitality is the right one for me. I’ve been working as an independent server (working for temp agencies )for almost 2 years now but I want a stable job and a stable life.

I’ve decided to move out finally, I need the space to become the person I want to be I just don’t know if I should move on my own here or move to Toronto.

I see Ottawa as really family-oriented city, somewhere where you move to settle down. Despite what people say I do not think is a dead city as it is said, you can find activities to do as long as you are willing to go out but in Toronto I feel like we are all on the same boat and diversity is way more accepted.

After 5 years in Ottawa with everything I’ve been through I was never able to build a social circle, I have no friends. 

Living in Ottawa made me feel alone and at times judged by others (which I know is mostly in my head), instead every time I go to Toronto being alone does not feel like a problem and I always have the feeling that everybody is trying to figure it out for themselves that they don’t even have the time to care about you, which sounds bad, but I feel that’s what I need: a non-judgemental environment where I can find the space to discover myself better. 

For example here in Ottawa, people know me for being very introverted but I want to start doing stuff, going to clubs, changing my look, and the clothes that I wear and generally getting out of my comfort zone without having to explain myself but I don’t feel confident enough to do it in a place where people (especially family) have known me in a certain way, while I feel like I could do restart my life in Toronto since no one knows the old me. For example last month I had my nails done for the first time and did two piercings and I feel like my co-workers and family started seeing me in a different way (which kind of made me feel uncomfortable). There were no bad intentions but I feel less motivated now to do more changes about me without feeling a bit ashamed.

At the same time, I hate the idea of leaving Ottawa with nothing left (no people I care about to go back to and no knowledge about the city since I never did any kind of activities besides the places I’ve worked at), but also I can go to Toronto and eventually come back one day with a different mentality. 

They say “Wherever you go there you are”, I don’t want to run away from me, just leave my bad habits and the bad environments.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? What would you do if you were me?

depression,dkx9yc,I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

depression,1e433hf,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health, I don’t want to go back to work and just done with life.","Sorry I just needed to rant because my have nowhere else to turn to.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I’m worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I’m just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I’m very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I’m unrevealing now and I don’t even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.

But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I’ve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn’t given bereavement leave by my manager, so I’ve been calling in sick, I’ve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.

I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn’t helpful, she’s lovely but she doesn’t know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. 

My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself.

depression,1e6k63a,How can I support my sibling with her mental health,"Hello!! I need some help-
My lovely sister (28) is 5 years older than me, I have been doing my best to support her throughout her mental health struggles but i’m so scared it isn’t enough and i’m petrified that she may give up on life.

Our parents separated at a young age and I believe a lot of the problems she has now may stem from that (it was very messy) but we are very very close and have a good relationship. She suffered through anorexia, self harm and a suicide attempt in high school and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She was in and out of the hospital a few times as well. She goes through waves of severe depression and then bouts of confidence and joy that lasts a few months only for her to fall right back into a deep depression. She says she has never truly been happy and has been depressed all her life so she has no hope that it will ever get better. When things are bad they are really bad- i’ve seen her go from being hysterically happy to having a complete breakdown and hyperventilating in the span of a few minutes. She can get very hypersensitive to noise, touch, smells etc. and has said that she feels no emotions or empathy. She often times tells me she feels drugged or dazed when she’s not taking anything. She’s told me that life is fake and nothing is real. She has a lot of social anxiety too and feels like everyone secretly hates her. She has been to therapy and seen physiatrists and has taken different anti depressants but nothing seems to work. I am urging her to see her psychologist but she doesn’t care to. I help her get started on typical tasks that she otherwise puts off. I don’t blame her for any of this as I understand her struggles but it is a bit difficult navigating two lives at once and I will never resent her but I do fear for her safety constantly. Recently I have a feeling she’s lost her job and hasn’t told me. She says things like “I won’t be here long enough to find out” and I just don’t know what to do to help. She craves stability and has never felt like she’s had it. She has my unconditional love and support and we always come up with options for her and I try to guide her to make her own decisions (she’s not very good at deciding things) but I don’t want to live her life for her because decisions are what makes your life your own! I am a very positive person and I honestly think this makes things worse because she feels the need to “balance” things out but I just want her to share the love for life that I have. I am sorry this is so lengthy but I am at such a loss and I know she needs professional help (also very expensive)(she also feels it’s temporary which doesn’t help) but I just don’t know what to do anymore and could really use some advice on what I can do or say to make her life better and make her want to get better. She says sadness is a comforting feeling because it never goes away and it just breaks my heart to see her like this. I’ve seen her happy I know it’s possible and i’ll do everything I can. But I don’t know what. Please please let me know what has helped you in similar situations. I can’t lose her.

depression,1dn014h,how do I get better? Any advice or tips to get a better mental health.,"This is my first ever post. I’ve read the rules and guidelines and don’t believe anything is against it. Anywho here is my piece. (This is very much a frantic or all over the place post. I don’t know how to straighten it up better bc I am a mess lol) 

I was diagnosed roughly 5 years ago, but definitely dealt with it for maybe 8 years, if not 10. (My sense of time is really not great.)

 ANYWHO got diagnosed with clinical depression and severe anxiety. I’ve been to therapy 2 separate times but feel the advice that I was given both times don’t help. They tell me to learn coping mechanisms, positive affirmations, etc. personally I feel they are generic bandaids. I feel as though my trauma and mental illnesses are so deep rooted that those won’t work for me. I journal occasionally, but struggle with making habits. I try looking up stuff to help my self esteem such as being more self compassionate, meditation, medication, etc. Again I feel like those don’t help and if they do it’s on such a small scale that I am the only one that notices it. 

I currently live with my boyfriend and he loves me and supports me the best he knows how. (He asks me what he can, but the only thing I can think of is just support me because I don’t even know how to help myself) 

TO CLARIFY!!!! I do not feel or want to hurt myself or other in anyway shape or form and do not recommend that either. 🚫

But I feel like a burden to EVERYONE and feel like it’d just be best if I disappeared or just left everyone and was by myself. I feel like my illness is not only hard on me but everyone especially my boyfriend because I live with him.  I don’t know how to get better. I try and work on myself but it makes no difference and I feel bad that people have to be around me. I feel I’m difficult to love and I feel my bf will eventually get tired of me because of this. 

I do not know what to do. I’m hopeless and distressed bc I don’t feel like it will get better. I don’t want to ruin my young year being sad. (I’m 22F) I’m also anxious all the time and my biggest worry is being judged and I also think I’m a little autistic bc I completely lack social skills . Idk how to small talk so I don’t have any friends of my own because I don’t know how to talk. I feel I and just a clusterfuck of issues and idk . I’m don’t know what to do anymore. I want to be better really I want to help myself and I want to be better for everyone around me I just don’t know anymore.

Thank you for reading and replying with anything helpful. I will try to continue to find a good therapist but in the meantime I need to help myself somehow.

depression,1d2wh76,Aging parents with health issues triggering depression,"First and foremost before going into the details of why I am posting, I have never been clinically diagnosed with depression, although I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder. I do have a history of bipolar disorder on my mothers side of my family spanning several generations though.

Now to the reason why I am posting today - I just got back from visiting my parents. Both are now in their 70s and my mother has some severe health issues. To the point where the best me, my sister, and dad can hope for is that her condition will remain stable and not get any worse. A real recovery seems very unlikely at this point. She also deals with panic attacks and addiction challenges (nicotine for a long time, and after she gave that up, alcohol). My mother has always been a rock that my immediate family has relied upon for support, and now she needs that support in return.

Me, my wife, and daughters just returned from visiting them over the long holiday weekend in the US. We live about 4.5 hours away from them when driving by car. It didn’t hit me until we left to return home that my mother’s illness and me being as far away from her and my dad is affecting me as much as it is. I am starting to feel helpless and unable to live up to what I feel I need to do to take care of my aging parents. I feel guilty for being as far away from them as I am.

With all this piling on emotionally, I am starting to wonder if I am slipping into a depression. I dont want to burden my wife with this, she herself has dealt with depression, anxiety, and ADHD her entire life. I need to be able to keep myself mentally able to support her and our daughters. Yet now I am scared that I won’t be able to do that. With ADHD and anxiety i have figured out how to deal with them through medication and other support. Depression has me more anxious now than ever though. If I start to shutdown mentally, everyone that depends on me for support will not have that available. Especially my children and wife which is the scariest prospect of all.

I’m not entirely sure what to do at this point.

depression,1d8suqw, Ghosted by a friend with mental health problems ,"Hello,

Not sure this is the right place but I'm looking for advice. For the 3rd time in less than a year, a friend stopped opening my texts or answering my calls. Her mom tells me she relapsed and this is normal in people with anxiety and depression. The first 2 times, I was the one reconnecting after the ghost. This time, I also sent messages and called but stopped after talking to her mom. I miss her but don't want to be the one always putting in the effort.

depression,1cyicsl,How to find motivation for health?,"So this whole post is about motivation in general. Because I don't have any lol. I have major depressive disorder, but I'd say I'm quite functional. I taught myself to be functionally depressed so that I could hide the depression from my family and friends (which I have successfully done btw). The only person that knows is my bf. He is a great guy, mentally healthy and VERY health conscious (literally have no idea what he sees in me but I'm not gonna question it) 

I struggle with motivation in all things, but mostly small things. Things like answering text messages feel so difficult to do. I will go a week without answering messages because I literally don't have the energy, or I simply just don't care. BUT I do care abt the ppl I'm talking to. It's the same with fitness. 

I'm pretty overweight and I want to lose weight, I want to be healthy. But whenever it comes to actually doing it, this intense feeling of apathy takes over. Like I literally just don't fucking care, but I also want it? Idk if that feeling makes any sense, but that's the best I can describe it. 

I have pretty severe anxiety whenever I go to the gym, and eating healthy I just cant bring myself to care even though I want it. And the reason I know it's not laziness, is because it's the same with everything. I have hobbies that I absolutely love. I love photography, don't care abt doing it. Love learning languages, don't care abt taking the time. Love reading, don't care. Love my friends, don't care abt answering messages. 

This feeling is so weird and defeating and I can't tell if it's just me, cause it makes 0 sense. My bf is trying really hard to help me to lose weight and be healthy. And it's difficult for him that I have such a hard time. Don't get me wrong, I told him I wanted the help, but now I feel terrible because I csnt bring myself to give a shit abt doing a single thing. Things that I love. Things that I want. 

Right now it feels like this overwhelming force is cutting the strings connecting my desires to my willpower. And I'm completely powerless. 

I have a pretty extensive history with self-harm, and luckily I haven't relapsed, but I've been thinking about it more and more, as I just keep becoming more and more sad abt how apathetic I'm feeling. Depression is a fucked up thing man, I'm hoping someone here understands and can help. Cause mentally healthy people just wouldn't get it. 

So if any severely depressed people who got over this feeling, how in the actual fuck did you do it?

I’m so sick and tired of the “why can’t you just go to bed early, try yoga and breathing exercises, eat healthier, do affirmations and meditate on positive things?” crap. I’m not saying those things can’t help at all, but some people actually need medication or things like psychodynamic therapy.

My dumbass was high at the time and didn't look up reviews. Looking at them now, a lot of people were using the app for urgent care...I wasn't so that's why I'm posting this here to find out other experiences with their mental health options.

I signed up, went through the whole thing of downloading the app & talking to the healthcare professional. This was $50 up front. I couldn't tell if the woman I was talking to was AI or not?? She texted me a wall of text after about 30 seconds lol bc I know it had to be copy+paste or AI. That's fine and all, but something was just off, especially when it came to sounding like a real human. All the texts were formatted like chaptgpt lmao. But she had a picture & credentials so who knows.

Anyway she ended up telling me I'm not fit for the program bc my PCP is prescribing me ambien and I can re-enroll later. She didn't even give me the option to tell her I'd be willing to give up the ambien if she was able to prescribe me something else. So basically she told me bye after maybe only 15 minutes.

depression,18gi6am,"*TRIGGER WARNING: SH, SA, mental health* Hi 👋🏼","Hi. I just need a place to vent..

I struggle really hard with mental health issues. I’ve been on tons of medications, been to tons of therapy, done tons of self searching and I feel like I’m just never gonna feel happy. I quite literally hate every other aspect of my life other than my children because if they didn’t exist I absolutely would not exist. Living my life is painful, not just mentally but I have physical manifestations of pain as a result of my mental health issues as well. 

So far my diagnosis are the following:
Major depression 
Generalized anxiety 
Bipolar disorder 
ADHD

I have not always been the best person, I’ve made quite a negative perspective of myself due to some of my behaviors and things I’ve done/said, I have been a really fucked up person, even recently but I am really really trying to be a good person..I truly just don’t know how to navigate life because I was never taught how. I grew up in a really toxic, broken, boarderline abusive family of 8 (mom, dad, grandmother, brother, his wife, their two kids) and I went through a lot of traumatic events and situations starting from a really young age. I watched my mother’s mental health decline to the point where she took her own life. I had to grow up at the age of around 8 to help take care of my grandmother, my mother, my brothers kids (because they were addicts and always out doing something else) and taking care of myself because my dad had to work two sometimes three jobs to support us. I found my mother butchering herself in the shower (SH) and I had to call police, I watched her have a panic attack so severe I had to call police. She had staph in her spine to the point where she had to have vertebrae removed and metal rods and screws placed and at 8 years old I was caring for my mother full assist, toileting, eating, dressing, showering, etc. After my mother died I started spiraling, isolating, never really went out, I started to SH myself, trying to numb the pain of my life, I attempted a few times, resulting in 3 different hospital stays. I started smoking weed and drinking occasionally around 13/14. I started going to parties with people I shouldn’t. I was SA’d by my friends older brother at a sleepover with all our friends when I was 15, went through the whole legal process of having him locked up. I dropped out of school shortly after and haven’t been back since. I’ve been in 3 abusive relationships (3 that were physical at least) and that’s just the main traumas

Experiencing all of the trauma and the dynamics of my family has shaped me into someone who does not know how to handle confrontation, conflict, I have codependency and obsession issues that manifest without my knowledge until after damage is done. I self sabotage because I have to feel in control, I’m a huge people pleaser, I can’t commit out of fear, I can’t trust, I’m paranoid, numb, emotional and I just can’t keep living like this. I feel so lonely and trapped by myself and I don’t know how to pull myself out.  

I’m just blabbing at this point so to anyone who actually read this thank you and I’m sorry..

My story is not unique, but it is mine, and it's about time it was told.  
I am a 21-year-old woman who, like many others, embarked on the exciting yet daunting journey of higher education with dreams in my eyes and hope in my heart. What I didn't expect, however, was for those dreams to be clouded by an uninvited guest: mental health struggles.  
As exams loomed and deadlines approached, what started as mere stress evolved into something far more insidious. Sleepless nights spent staring at the ceiling, pages of notes blurring before tear-filled eyes, and an overwhelming sense of isolation became my new normal. Anxiety and depression, two terms I had heard but never truly understood, became my constant companions.  
The university, a place I had thought would be a haven of support and understanding, seemed indifferent to my struggles. Resources were either scarce or stretched too thin, and the few times I mustered the courage to seek help, I was met with long waiting lists and generic advice. I felt lost, alone, and misunderstood.  
But in the darkest of times, I found a flicker of hope in the digital world. Online forums, mental health apps, and virtual therapy became my sanctuary. It was through these platforms that I found not only coping mechanisms but a community of individuals who shared my experiences. They offered not just empathy but practical advice and resources that I could access anytime, anywhere.  
This digital lifeline was a game-changer for me. Slowly, I began to find my footing again. I learned mindfulness techniques to manage my anxiety, found online study groups that helped alleviate the loneliness, and engaged in virtual counseling sessions that offered the support I so desperately needed.  
My journey through the maze of mental health and academia taught me valuable lessons, not just about resilience and self-care, but about the importance of accessible support for students. It's a cause I've now dedicated myself to, advocating for better mental health resources on campus and raising awareness about the digital tools that can make a difference.  
I share my story not for sympathy, but to shed light on an issue that affects countless students. It's a call to action for universities to prioritize mental health as much as academic achievement. It's also a message of hope to those who are struggling in silence—you are not alone, and there is help available.  
As I continue my journey, both as a student and an advocate for mental health, I am reminded of the power of sharing our stories. It's through these narratives that we can break down the stigma, build understanding, and foster a community where no one has to navigate their darkest moments alone.  
To anyone reading this who sees themselves in my story, know that your feelings are valid, your experiences are real, and there is a path to healing. Together, we can create a change, making mental health support not just an option but a fundamental part of the student experience.  
In sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to speak out, seek help, and support one another.

depression,17kr66v,TLDR: My mental health is ruining my life,"My mental health is ruining my life. And grief has made it worse. I’m typing this because I can’t sleep. I suffer from anxiety, depression, and probably other things that I don’t know about. But I’ve noticed over the years, especially since I was in high school (graduated in 2019), that I was always and still am drawn to my phone, like I can’t put it down (I can sometimes if I’m busy, but I don’t like being away from it). I’m so obsessed with and drawn to social media. And I hate to say it, but my depression has made me mentally and physically lazy over the years, like, yeah, if there’s a task I’ll have to do, I’ll do it. But it keeps me cooped up at home a lot, and I’m scared to work because my anxiety is that bad. I haven’t had a job since 2020 because of COVID, but I do make money from selling cookies and crochet items. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried therapy a few times, and don’t get me wrong, my therapist was amazing, but I couldn’t be consistent. Just like my anxiety medication, I wasn’t consistent. And it’s all weighing down on me because where I am today is all my fault; I’m not where I want to be because I don’t know what I want. But I’d like to experience a life without my terrible anxiety—a life without depression weighing me down. It feels like an anchor that can’t be pulled up; my mental health is ruining relationships, or at least I feel like it is. I feel like a burden, and I always tend to look at everyone I meet as a savior. Every day at home in my room, I do leave out a few times and sometimes even go to the store or doctor. I don’t like these feelings, and I don’t know what I should do at this point. I want to help myself, but deep down inside, I don’t think anyone understands. I can’t fathom reality, so over the years, I’ve been living in my head. Part of me feels like I don’t deserve love because I don’t know how to accept it or give it. I'm selfish deep inside; I get angry easily, and lately I’m sure everything I’ve been feeling in my body has been reacting.

depression,181hft7,"Thinking about mental health, anxiety? Input appreciated","I was “diagnosed” with depression/anxiety my senior year of high school, but for context I had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue, not mental health. Before this I never thought of my mental as bad ever, and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person. After this quote on quote diagnosis which I refer to as such because I feel one questionnaire does not define me and how I feel, but I have had a hard time actually practicing this thought. I feel like depression/anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i’m not busy/distracted enough that’s where my mind goes and I feel down or anxious but more that i’m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining. Like I went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but I was still thinking about my mental health and how I am feeling and I feel like it is always looming over whatever I do and it’s very frustrating for me. I want to live a day where i’m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking. I have been in therapy for 2 ish years which has been helpful but I still struggle with these thoughts.

depression,10l53m3,I'm 24. Is it worth getting tested for mental health disorders at this age?,"I know it won't change anything, but I'd like to know why I'm the way I am. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, which isn't a very long time because I seem to have repressed my entire childhood. My anxiety used to be crippling but after teasing myself with a suicide attempt that obviously didn't pan out, my anxiety hasn't really been a problem anymore. In fact, I can't really seem to be worried about much anymore, just whatever doesn't involve me. If it's someone else suffering, I want to help, but I can't push myself to help myself. 

I went to therapy a few years ago and she thought I might actually be on the spectrum to a degree. I do check some boxes to be fair to her, I wouldn't be surprised if I am slightly autistic. I also have a sneaky suspicion that my depression might be passively fueled by undiagnosed ADHD or one of its variants. So many things about me from when I was younger line up with these possible disorders and maybe even others too. 

I'm not here to give a deep dive into my head, I'm not ready for that to be attached to my profile forever, but I do wonder if it's worth trying to get to the bottom of all this. I suffered some serious abuse as a child that I denied myself accepting as abuse and couldn't process for a very long time because of that attitude to it, so that definitely plays a factor in who I am now. At my age, in my position in life as a (failing) University student, is it worth even trying to diagnose anything concrete like a disorder? I don't even know where to begin that journey if I do decide to follow it. 

Anyone else here who got a diagnosis later in life, or went through the testing process later in life, did any of it make a difference? Is it something I should look into?

depression,izn5op,I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool.

depression,185asva,Thinking about mental health/anxiety? Input appreciated,"

I was “diagnosed” with depression/anxiety my senior year of high school, but for context I had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue, not mental health. Before this I never thought of my mental as bad ever, and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person. After this quote on quote diagnosis which I refer to as such because I feel one questionnaire does not define me and how I feel, but I have had a hard time actually practicing this thought. I feel like depression/anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i’m not busy/distracted enough that’s where my mind goes and I feel down or anxious but more that i’m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining. Like I went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but I was still thinking about my mental health and how I am feeling and I feel like it is always looming over whatever I do and it’s very frustrating for me. I want to live a day where i’m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking. I have been in therapy for 2 ish years which has been helpful but I still struggle with these thoughts. We have discussed medication and my doctor and therapist say 25 mg of zoloft could be beneficial, but for many reasons I would be anxious to try it. One thought i’ve been having recently is since i never had mental problems before my “diagnosis” that i’m not actually depressed or anxious rather it’s just a thought that’s in my head that can be sort of a self fulfilling prophecy. So of course I google what would happen if a. normal person had antidepressants and the risk of seratonin syndrome comes up which makes me anxious because i’m very anxious about my health. I would like to try it because maybe it can help with my thoughts and help me feel happy again, but the idea of starting it makes me anxious. Any insight or help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",2,0,i was diagnosed with depression anxiety my senior year of high school but for context i had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue not mental health before this i never thought of my mental as bad ever and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person after this quote on quote diagnosis which i refer to as such because i feel one questionnaire does not define me and how i feel but i have had a hard time actually practicing this thought i feel like depression anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i m not busy distracted enough that s where my mind goes and i feel down or anxious but more that i m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining like i went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but i was still thinking about my mental health and how i am feeling and i feel like it is always looming over whatever i do and it s very frustrating for me i want to live a day where i m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking i have been in therapy for ish years which has been helpful but i still struggle with these thoughts we have discussed medication and my doctor and therapist say mg of zoloft could be beneficial but for many reasons i would be anxious to try it one thought i ve been having recently is since i never had mental problems before my diagnosis that i m not actually depressed or anxious rather it s just a thought that s in my head that can be sort of a self fulfilling prophecy so of course i google what would happen if a normal person had antidepressants and the risk of seratonin syndrome comes up which makes me anxious because i m very anxious about my health i would like to try it because maybe it can help with my thoughts and help me feel happy again but the idea of starting it makes me anxious any insight or help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated,0.014401624945103214,0.9906,NEGATIVE,0.9908486604690552,neutral,positive,negative
depression,13x1ijd,My mental health,"This may be long but is is time for me to tell someone, anyone my story. I am 22(m) and have battled depression, anxiety, and a whole shit load of stress for just about 4 years now. It all started when I was involved in an accident fresh out of high school where I got a head injury. At this point I am a relaxed, easy going kid who just has a good time with life. Doctors diagnosed a severe concussion and sent me home to heal. NEVER has my life been the same. I quickly noticed my brain thinking and juggling way to many things at once. Breaking down on a daily basis for no reason and no understanding of what is happening to me. At 20 I tried to take my life and was unsuccessful. Things were getting worse everyday and i lost control of my brain and my thoughts. Eventually trying medication to make myself happy and help me progress my career. the profession I chose at 16 years old knowing it was going to take me where I wanted. Meds turned me to a zombie. Not a sign of emotion came out of me for months as I forgot how to laugh, how to be sad, mad, glad, etc. I completely lost all emotion. I quit my meds about a year ago and that brings me to now. I am able to reach the absolute HIGHEST of HIGHS and LOWEST of LOWS. Any smile is followed by a frown. Any laugh is followed with a cry. Anything good is immediately wrote of in my head as “undeserved”. Good days are followed by nights full of crying and depression. I have no motivation to do anything I enjoy, no motivation to work which is the thing I’ve prided myself on since I was old enough to think. 
I no longer want to be here, I no longer have anything I want more than death… the one thing keeping me here is my high school sweetheart. The one who watched my life nosedive to hell and spends every bit of energy just keeping me afloat. The effort she put into loving me, and into making me love myself keeps me here. 
In the end, I live through the highest of highs in life and I live through the lowest of lows. And I can tell you right now… the lows are winning. I know this helps nobody, but I need someone to hear my story. I need to get this off my chest. Eliminate that fake smile I put on everyday and just tell the truth.",4,5,this may be long but is is time for me to tell someone anyone my story i am m and have battled depression anxiety and a whole shit load of stress for just about years now it all started when i was involved in an accident fresh out of high school where i got a head injury at this point i am a relaxed easy going kid who just has a good time with life doctors diagnosed a severe concussion and sent me home to heal never has my life been the same i quickly noticed my brain thinking and juggling way to many things at once breaking down on a daily basis for no reason and no understanding of what is happening to me at i tried to take my life and was unsuccessful things were getting worse everyday and i lost control of my brain and my thoughts eventually trying medication to make myself happy and help me progress my career the profession i chose at years old knowing it was going to take me where i wanted meds turned me to a zombie not a sign of emotion came out of me for months as i forgot how to laugh how to be sad mad glad etc i completely lost all emotion i quit my meds about a year ago and that brings me to now i am able to reach the absolute highest of highs and lowest of lows any smile is followed by a frown any laugh is followed with a cry anything good is immediately wrote of in my head as undeserved good days are followed by nights full of crying and depression i have no motivation to do anything i enjoy no motivation to work which is the thing i ve prided myself on since i was old enough to think i no longer want to be here i no longer have anything i want more than death the one thing keeping me here is my high school sweetheart the one who watched my life nosedive to hell and spends every bit of energy just keeping me afloat the effort she put into loving me and into making me love myself keeps me here in the end i live through the highest of highs in life and i live through the lowest of lows and i can tell you right now the lows are winning i know this helps nobody but i need someone to hear my story i need to get this off my chest eliminate that fake smile i put on everyday and just tell the truth,0.1725456148789482,-0.871,NEGATIVE,0.9972018003463745,positive,negative,negative

depression,15vcfgw,"Abuse, Death, Allegations, Health, etc","I don't really know why I'm doing this, but I guess I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest, I don't know.  Just hate myself.  Gonna try to go through 20 years worth of trauma and pain, so bear with me.

I'll start with my health and birth, as they're linked.  Premature baby by 4 weeks, my lungs collapsed which is probably why I have asthma.  It's also why I have a weak stomach, which caused me to be a picky baby, which carried over as I got older, as I can't even try eating most things without gagging as most foods taste and feel disgusting to me.  I have been diagnosed with scoliosis and depression.  I have undiagnosed insomnia, anxiety, memory issues, attention issues, and ankle pain, likely caused by my many many sprains.  Some of that is left over effects from previous meds, some of which they tried to fix with more meds.  My stomach occasionally inflates like a balloon, not gas I mean actually inflates, which puts me on the floor, which is a left over effect from a previous medicine.  I also have panic attacks, only ever having them when I was being yelled at and threatened by my family, for no reason, when I tried to talk to them about my issues and then also when I went to the hospital and they cave me pain medicines that I guess I just reacted to negatively.  Or maybe I was just stressed, I don't know.  For daily medicines, I was on Prozac, Vyvance, Prilosec, and Folic Acid until I turned 18-19 and lost my healthcare.  Oh also I used to basically starve because, no one would feed me, I had poor body image, and the Vyvance killed my appetite.  I also used to take a daily inhaler when I was super young.

As for family, I'll start with father figures.  I was born into a broken home, my parents splitting before I was born.  My grandpa on my fathers side is in jail for pedophilia, I've never met him.  My father abused and raped my mom, molested my sister when she was young, recorded my mother sleeping and going to the bathroom and threatened to put it online, cheated on my mom with my aunt, and did a host of other awful things, a lot of which I didn't learn about till later in life.  I'd go to see him on weekends sometimes, but he never acted too interested in having anything to do with me and he eventually quit trying, so I stopped trying too.  I didn't invite him to my Graduation stuff, which pissed off one of his other kids.  He recently passed away, he was found in his house with barely any food, barely any water, he hadn't taken his meds, and had drunk a bunch of sweet liquor.  He's a diabetic, so that killed him.  I believe it was ruled and accident, but it's obvious to me it was a suicide.  He'd been trying to use his health to get attention from all of his kids, well except me, I wasn't even important enough for that.  My first stepfather cheated on my mom, treated me unfairly, and just wasn't the best.  My mom dated a few more people who came and went, then found a guy she loves who I got along with.  He was arrested for not paying child support and died because they refused to treat him for, I think, diabetes as well.  My mom then got with my most recent father figure, the one who caused me to have panic attacks.  He'd yell at me, threaten to fight me and beat me up, get drunk, argue with my mom, he pulled a gun and was gonna shoot my dogs until I pushed him and told him he'd have to kill me first, he handed me a gun and told me to kill myself, and I have a memory of him trying to have sex with me, but he denied it happened and my mom says I must have hallucinated it, because I had just been put on Prozac at the time.  He died just 2 days ago, he'd been fighting cirrhosis of the liver and his liver went into failure and the build up of ammonia in his body caused him to go into cardiac arrest.

As for the women in my family, I'm a momma's boy, but me and her have been driven farther and farther apart.  She got a job when I was 10, maybe younger, and works night shift at that same job still to this day.  That means I saw her less though and over time I've realized she understands very little about me.  She's not the best at giving me support when my mental health is low and she refuses to acknowledge how her last man treated me, telling me I'm overreacting even though I was confronted with a gun twice.  She's having to go into surgery soon, for a massive ovarian cyst.  They also thought she might have colon cancer, but it seems she luckily doesn't.  I used to go to my grandma's a lot, but all she ever did was make me feel awful about myself.  She would run me down, tell me how I'm fat, lazy, my dreams are stupid, I'm wrong, I'm this, I'm that.  She'd also talk shit about everyone in my life.  Overall just very mentally abusive.  She also slapped me in the face after I got frustrated, because she was yelling at me for not doing 2 different things on opposite sides of the room at the same time.  I'm really close to my sister, but she had a really bad drug problem for years and was mean for a long time because of it.  She's clean now and we're close as I said, but she replaced drugs with drinking, which is still bad, but it's significantly better.  She's got some awful depression though, but I can't blame her after what my father did to her and all the other shit she's had to experience.

My sexual trauma and issues, relationships, and allegations.. Oh boy.  I'm a very hypersexual person, with awful sexual trauma, and intense fear of being viewed as predator, which stems from my father and grandfather both being them.  I had an sexual relationship with my older step sister, from the age of like 4 or younger to the age of 10.  It luckily never went all the way.  I initiated most of the time, but I don't know if I was the one who started it the first time.  I dated someone when I was younger who tried to encourage me to try bestiality, which I almost did.  Both things I despise myself for, but both things I'm happy never went any farther.  I would secretly do sexual things in school, sometimes by myself, sometimes with someone else.  Jumped into a relationship with a girl who had just moved there and she'd make me uncomfortable by touching me at school, so I left her like a week after getting with her and she tried to say I beat her, which obviously wasn't true.  Finally went all the way with someone when I was 17, she was almost 3 years younger than me, which was legal in my state at the time, but still stupid of me.  I was still a stupid kid and thought I loved her.  Got addicted to sex with her cause we did it everyday for months.  She started treating me badly, yelling anytime we had a slight disagreement, ripping stuff off the walls, would try to cut herself if I yelled back, cancelling plans last minute, denying me any affection sexual or emotional, refusing to hang out with me, and it just wasn't great and me being addicted to sex caused problems for us cause she had decided she didn't like sex anymore.  We should've broke up cause our love languages weren't compatible, mine is physical hers isn't, but we were stubborn and stupid and tried to compromise by seeing if there was anything she would be comfortable with doing with me, trying an open relationship, or simply by just not having sex and getting used to it.  Honestly, that last one was working, I'd be sexually frustrated for a little bit, but eventually I'd get over it and after a few days or weeks I'd stop being sexually frustrated all together, but then she'd go out of her way to touch me and do things to turn me on, just to say no and put me right back into being sexually frustrated.  It felt very deliberate.  I finally just told her we weren't compatible and left her.  We stayed friends until she found out I was hooking up with someone new, which pissed her off.  She started using my trauma against me, calling me a zoophile and a manipulator, making fun of me for eating despite knowing I'd basically starve myself, accusing me of SAing her, and insinuating I'm a pedo for being in a relationship with her.  Something I know she's only doing because she knows about my father and grandfather and my fear of being viewed like them.  She would go to my new gf's page to steal pictures of me.  Again, I've made bad decisions, hurt plenty of people, and done many things I regret and hate myself for when I was younger, but I never SA'd her or anyone else, nor do I think me as a 17 y/o being with someone who's not even 3 years younger than me should make me a pedo, but anyways maybe I'm just awful you guys decide that for yourself.  Either way, I've been trying to work on fixing myself and I've made a lot of progress I think.  My most recent gf seemingly used me.  I helped her escape an abuser, fed her cause she wasn't being fed while with him, she left him, moved back to town, and got with me.  I gave her everything, spent money on her pretty much daily, was her emotional support, gave her sex when she wanted it, I gave her everything I could.  She'd never do anything I wanted though, it was always about what she wanted.  We only watched what she wanted and if I tried to get her to watch something I wanted she'd start doing anything else.  I'd try to talk to her and she'd ignore me.  I'd go for a hug or a kiss and she'd push me away.  I felt very unloved so we occasionally argued about it.  She texted me saying she didn't have feelings for me and a week later was with a guy she had promised me she had no feelings for and that I didn't have to worry about.  Oh and we thought she was pregnant with my kid when she decided to leave me, we found out later she wasn't pregnant, she'd just missed her period multiple times for some reason.

After my most recent relationship ended, I just felt awful for a while.  I started having nightmares and things just got bad.  I got so upset that I planned to go home and overdose, but work was so busy and I was mentally exhausted which made me work slower, so I stayed at work significantly later than usual, which gave me time to calm down and since then I've been emotionally neutral for the most part, but I still have mental breakdowns every once in a while.

There's honestly probably so much more, but I think my brain gave up just now.  I hate myself so much, cause I know I have done awful things, but I'm trying so hard to be better and I know I'm getting better, but it's hard to believe it, especially when people are tearing you down.",2,2,i don't really know why i'm doing this but i guess i just wanted to get some stuff off my chest i don't know just hate myself gonna try to go through years worth of trauma and pain so bear

a lot of progress i think my most recent gf seemingly used me i helped her escape an abuser fed her cause she wasn't being fed while with him she left him moved back to town and got with me i gave her everything spent money on her pretty much daily was her emotional support gave her sex when she wanted it i gave her everything i could she'd never do anything i wanted though it was always about what she wanted we only watched what she wanted and if i tried to get her to watch something i wanted she'd start doing anything else i'd try to talk to her and she'd ignore me i'd go for a hug or a kiss and she'd push me away i felt very unloved so we occasionally argued about it she texted me saying she didn't have feelings for me and a week later was with a guy she had promised me she had no feelings for and that i didn't have to worry about oh and we thought she was pregnant with my kid when she decided to leave me we found out later she wasn't pregnant she'd just missed her period multiple times for some reason after my most recent relationship ended i just felt awful for a while i started having nightmares and things just got bad i got so upset that i planned to go home and overdose but work was so busy and i was mentally exhausted which made me work slower so i stayed at work significantly later than usual which gave me time to calm down and since then i've been emotionally neutral for the most part but i still have mental breakdowns every once in a while there's honestly probably so much more but i think my brain gave up just now i hate myself so much cause i know i have done awful things but i'm trying so hard to be better and i know i'm getting better but it's hard to believe it especially when people are tearing you

depression,tx5xqg,mental health services are bullshit,"Reached out three times to my gp in the past 8 months.

Then said i was being referred somewhere else. Emailed them saying it was getting so bad, it was literally unbearable. Waited 2 more months, this was my lifeline. Turns out all I waited for was a for a telephone call where I said my panic attacks weren't as severe but I was feeling 'fine' just said that on repeat. To be given a pack on the back, said well done and i should be proud of myself for making myself better because i hadn't self harmed since the inncident, and offered no help moving forward. No insight into why I did it in the first place, no insight into anything at all. I have so many negative thoughts a day and all I want to do is escape sometimes. Thoughts of self harming most days is not something I wished was my new normal. I kind of want to feel the pain and have some relief for a second. I want to feel the burn. That makes me feel sad.

I am myself a hardgainer and have to eat a lot to gain at least some muscle or even fat. I occasionally have good appetite now and overall got used to eating a lot of calories so I think i can do it. I do bodyweight exercises, i have pullup bar, some weights, and i have some machines in my backyard so its not even necessary to go to a gym, though if things improve i am willing to come back to a gym. My sleep isnt that bad surprisingly, and when i take some calming medicine i can sleep for 7 hours+ uninterrupted so i guess i should be able to build muscle with consistency, right? 


The only problem though is that, well, I'm quite nervous and i take antidepressants so maybe it can lowen my testosterone levels and stunt my progress? So, guys who tried bulking during depression, share your experience, was it harder/slower to gain, or straight up impossible?",4,1,working out at home apartment block backyard is one of the only things that i currently enjoy doing and pretty much the only thing where i can build consistency at this point i am mostly sitting at home after finishing university not having a clue what to do later in life and not feeling physically and mentally well enough to do a lot of outside and social activity or any type of job i am myself a hardgainer and have to eat a lot to gain at least some muscle or even fat i occasionally have good appetite now and overall got used to eating a lot of calories so i think i can do it i do bodyweight exercises i have pullup bar some weights and i have some machines in my backyard so its not even necessary to go to a gym though if things improve i am willing to come back to a gym my sleep isnt that bad surprisingly and when i take some calming medicine i can sleep for hours uninterrupted so i guess i should be able to build muscle with consistency right the only problem though is that well i'm quite nervous and i take antidepressants so maybe it can lowen my testosterone levels and stunt my progress so guys who tried bulking during depression share your experience was it harder slower to gain or straight up impossible,0.07687074829931974,0.9608,NEGATIVE,0.9989655017852783,positive,positive,negative
depression,164we22,Triggered by mental health professionals,"It seems like mental health professionals keep triggering me. They say different things at the end like maybe ""you're not ready yet"" or ""you need to find someone who's more sensitive with their wording"". Or something like that. But it feels like they're judging me for every question they make, so many generalizations and assumptions based on what they feel like is normal to them, that are most of the time, completely inaccurate, and I have to keep correcting them, and most of the time, they feel sort of offended or resistant for being corrected. I feel like I'm a pretty normal person but they make me feel so abnormal that my mind torments me so badly for days or weeks after the interaction, and sometimes affects me for what I think will be the rest of my life. They keep acting like I'm defected, or mentally disordered, for something that they feel like is ""uncommon"", as my psychologist corrected me when I said it felt like they were judging me for not being normal to them. I felt insulted by how they continued arguing with me in defence of themself, saying that because I'm lonely, and I didn't hang out with friends outside of school, that means something's wrong with me- and they kept insisting on it, even though I tried to clarify that to me, it was normal... :( like i tried to explain, that the opportunity just didn't come up, and it just didn't happen, and felt normal to me. But then they kept insisting how it's ""statistically"" uncommon so that's why they're trying to figure out if this is a sign of a mental disorder or something... They even laughed at me when I said something to them that made me depressed.

It costs over $200 to talk to someone that judges me for an hour and makes me feel so triggered that I can't do anything but have anxiety and distress with trembling, heart racing, crying, and my mind at unease, like I'm losing myself. I've been talking to mental health professionals, counsellors, helpline responders, for three years now, with depression, and they all have wildly varying opinions on me depending on which facts I share, and they seem to be so stubborn on the perspective that they get just from their shallow, generalizing, minimal questions - so subjective and inaccurate. I thought a psychologist would be more professional and actually know how to handle the concepts more in-depth but it was actually worse than many other attempts I had, just suggesting to send me random worksheets that don't even apply to me, so I declined and told them not to continue any more sessions. It hurts me so much and I don't feel hopeful I'll meet someone who actually understands or empathizes, or is more objective and non-judgemental. Usually, after the interaction, I notice that other than feeling really disturbed and awful, that it feels like I'm completely surrounded by their shallow judgement, as if everyone thought that way, making me feel even more alone and hurt emotionally. 

I'm sorry for complaining so much, and possibly just blaming the other for feeling hurt and sort of traumatized, if I could be so audacious to say that... Anyway, just feel like I'm drowning in this and they're the only interactions with the outside world, dragging me further down into depression. I don't think I should continue seeing them any further.

They also uncomfortably keep insisting that I really should take medicine, even if I show that I don't want to... I remember my heart was beating so extremely hard and I was trying not to be completely drained, when they kept insisting that the medication for depression is reliable and many said that they got better like this one person blah blah, and how do you think about this? And all I can say is, very monotone, trying not to make my heart explode from the anxiety, stress, and pressure of having to disagree with them, that I don't like the idea still. :( oh well.

I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this. Just being dragged down further by mental health professionals, equal or worse than the demons of myself that drag me down, since they say things i could never even imagine- just making me realize and remember, engraining in my mind, that I'm abnormal, defected, a problem to them, etc. And that that's all I am... that's all they see.",1,1,it seems like mental health professionals keep triggering me they say different things at the end like maybe you're not ready yet or you need to find someone who's more sensitive with their wording or something like that but it feels like they're judging me for every question they make so many generalizations and assumptions based on what they feel like is normal to them that are most of the time completely inaccurate and i have to keep correcting them and most of the time they feel sort of offended or resistant for being corrected i feel like i'm a pretty normal person but they make me feel so abnormal that my mind torments me so badly for days or weeks after the interaction and sometimes affects me for what i think will be the rest of my life they keep acting like i'm defected or mentally disordered for something that they feel like is uncommon as my psychologist corrected me when i said it felt like they were judging me for not being normal to them i felt insulted by how they continued arguing with me in defence of themself saying that because i'm lonely and i didn't hang out with friends outside of school that means something's wrong with me and they kept insisting on it even though i tried to clarify that to me it was normal like i tried to explain that the opportunity just didn't come up and it just didn't happen and felt normal to me but then they kept insisting how it's statistically uncommon so that's why they're trying to figure out if this is a sign of a mental disorder or something they even laughed at me when i said something to them that made me depressed it costs over to talk to someone that judges me for an hour and makes me feel so triggered that i can't do anything but have anxiety and distress with trembling heart racing crying and my mind at unease like i'm losing myself i've been talking to mental health professionals counsellors helpline responders for three years now with depression and they all have wildly varying opinions on me depending on which facts i share and they seem to be so stubborn on the perspective that they get just from their shallow generalizing minimal questions so subjective and inaccurate i thought a psychologist would be more professional and actually know how to handle the concepts more in depth but it was actually worse than many other attempts i had just suggesting to send me random worksheets that don't even apply to me so i declined and told them not to continue any more sessions it hurts me so much and i don't feel hopeful i'll meet someone who actually understands or empathizes or is more objective and non judgemental usually after the interaction i notice that other than feeling really disturbed and awful that it feels like i'm completely surrounded by their shallow judgement as if everyone thought that way making me feel even more alone and hurt emotionally i'm sorry for complaining so much and possibly just blaming the other for feeling hurt and sort of traumatized if i could be so audacious to say that anyway just feel like i'm drowning in this and they're the only interactions with the outside world dragging me further down into depression i don't think i should continue seeing them any further they also uncomfortably keep insisting that i really should take medicine even if i show that i don't want to i remember my heart was beating so extremely hard and i was trying not to be completely drained when they kept insisting that the medication for depression is reliable and many said that they got better like this one person blah blah and how do you think about this and all i can say is very monotone trying not to make my heart explode from the anxiety stress and pressure of having to disagree with them that i don't like the idea still oh well i wonder if anyone else is experiencing this just being dragged down further by mental health professionals equal or worse than the demons of myself that drag me down since they say things i could never even imagine just making me realize and remember engraining in my mind that i'm abnormal defected a problem to them etc and that that's all i am that's all they see,0.04452054794520547,-0.9984,NEGATIVE,0.9983918070793152,neutral,negative,negative
depression,dxxwxn,"Just got discharged from the hospital today, suicide. My thoughts on the experience for those concerned about the mental health hospitals","**Disclaimer: I am posting a recent experience I had with suicide and mental health hospital and if course, depression. I'm not recommending anything for anybody, I'm merely hoping to explain my experience. If others find use in it, great. If not, then this will be ignored no harm no foul.**

Brief story: I tend to get down in the winter right around October, November, December. Don't know why.  Last year it got bad enough I relapsed to self harm.  And this year I had more work stress, more home stress, and more stress in general.  I didn't see the warning signs, like I noticed them but I was too far down the rabbit hole to register like

* Hey I don't care for video games, reading, or other hobbies
* I don't have motivation to do stuff with my family
* I'm always tired 
* I completely lost my appetite
* I can't focus on anything because I'm SO heavily fixated on suicide

Basically I got so far down the rabbit hole that suicide was the only option I saw. In retrospect there were things I could do to help my situation but in the moment I couldn't. And I was so closed in that my psychologist and psychiatrist words and ways to help wouldn't register.  I had a method picked out, I had a location, and the time was classified as ""very soon"" the only thing holding me back was getting a will notarized and a couple other things to help my family get by in my stead.  
I got drunk one night and that mixed with my depression resulted in me getting up at 9pm after everyone was asleep and walking for hours until about 3:30am.  I was feeling restless and I needed to do something because all I could picture was conducting my method of suicide.  And I couldn't do it there with my family, I had a place after all.  So I walked for nearly 6 hours off and on.  Ended up walking into an ER as the alcohol was wearing off.  I chickened out and when they asked if they could help I ended up asking if they had any refreshments. They were feeling very awkward, I don't blame them.  I just turned around and left. They were definitely feeling weirded out from a guy in his pajamas, barefoot, walking around huddled in the cold.  

Anyways. Told my doctor's how serious I was feeling. They called each other (with me present) and agreed to give me 3 options:

1. Intensive Outpatient Program
2. Voluntary Hospitalization
3. Involuntary Hospitalization

I chose to go voluntarily.  I agreed to commit the next day.  I got super anxious and almost went for suicide, I had to pass ""my spot"" on the lake.  But I struggled through it.  

The intake process was terrifying, but mainly due to my emotional state of mind, the admin folks always spoke gently and softly and respected my time to answer.  They walked me over to the unit I was assigned to. The moment of walking through the doors, knowing I couldn't go back after was.... Terrifying.  I finally went through, wasn't rushed.  The nurses doing my intake were very nice. I was terrified. But they did their best to help me.  Once I was done they let me stay in my room and didn't push me anymore. I spent the first and second day in my room without leaving, without eating.  I don't even think I used the restroom.  I was so inwardly focused that I couldn't take in my surroundings.  Nurses would come a few times a day and check in with me but didn't force me to talk, I think I gave one word answers.  On the third day I managed to get up for a while.  I had new meds, which I took.  The fourth day was the first day that I wasn't totally fixating on suicide.  Had some side effects (nausea) but it was improvement.  Day 5 I was feeling better, noticeably. And then day 6 was when I felt.... Close to normal.  I realized I was able to talk to people okay, I was reactive to my environment.  Day 6 I was feeling much better.  I realized I was no longer feeling really down but I was getting anxious because I was fixating on the limiting factors of the hospital. Locked doors, nurses watching everything, no cell phones, etc.  It kicked my anxiety up.  However today I was discharged.  I'm glad.  

Pros of the hospital:

* It limited stimuli significantly and that helped stabilize me

* Nurses were always there and asking how I was and helping coax me out of my shell as I was ready

* Seeing other patients in for different reasons (mainly alcohol/substance abuse, and then 2 other suicidal fks) really helped give me some outlook on my situation. Things could be worse, and that helped ME start to think proactively

* The group sessions at first felt corny but really did give me some good techniques.  I'm happy to send scans of the handouts to any interested 

* The therapists were super busy but always found time to speak to patients . I asked one to speak with me and she spent an hour if her time with me not pushing me and letting me word vomit my thoughts out and helped me identify some coping mechanisms 

* The nurses were great. I left tons of compliments.

* Seeing a psychiatrist every day was helpful in medicine adjustments


Cons:

* Very restricting. No cell phone, limited clothing, very restrictive environment. We had 2 lounges. 

* Lots of downtime. This is good when you're non-functioning because it helps you just relax. But once you start feeling better it's maddening. I recommend find a book they have to offer and just read. And journal your thoughts. It helps.  


I will say as a disclaimer, hospitals and processes are different. I was on Anthem Blue Cross.  I was able to drive directly to the hospital and be committed.  My wife used to be on Kaiser and wanted to be committed. She had to go to am Emergency room, get checked out, they use a ""bed finder"" to see what facility can take them, then an ambulance takes you to said facility, oftentimes restrained.  For my wife's experience it was awful.  She spent nearly 12 hours in the ER not allowed to use her phone or do anything, I had to leave after 5 to pick up the kid.  Then she got to the hospital, a couple hours away, and from what she described the process was very degrading and dehumanizing for someone in a crisis.  After that we've been comparing some of the differences and .... Well she started crying because she realized how different our experiences were. She ended up lying to get out because she felt worse in the hospital than out.  

Sorry for the length guys! If this is helpful, great, if not then.... I'm sorry. 

Feel free to ask me questions, keep in mind I can **only** speak of my experience.  I'm not a health care professional, so the best info you can get is directly from your doctor's, insurance, and other healthcare resources.  Also please reach out to your county Social Services office! They have some resources that can help!

depression,15jc2di,"33M I feel like my life lacks meaning and is without happiness.. trauma, unrealized mental health concerns and and overbearing sense of failure","Edit: I told my mom tonight that things haven't been going so great at work, and that I really feel like I just don't have the mind for the type of job that it is.. that I have a lot of brain fog, and she knows I don't have a good memory. I don't plan on quitting, but I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up getting rid of me eventually, and that that thought makes me very anxious and depressed. She seemed mad, and responded with ""  I don't know what to tell ya. If you lose this job your fucked. Guess you'll just work at Cumby's or Walmart then..unbelievable."" We went to a family party recently..all my cousins are doing really well for themselves. Two of them make 6 figures -- one of which just bought his own house to the tune of 400k. Another is a musical prodigy -- he's been playing guitar semi-profession since he was 8-9, and works for a big company that sells  sound systems to major venues/stadiums. He's getting married and having a baby soon. 

&#x200B;

I can tell that my mom thinks of me as a failure and a disappointment. Guess that makes two of us..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know where to even begin..I'm just writing to vent because that's all I feel I can do. My life feels like a pit, void of any happiness. I have no friends. No lover. No kids. I hate my job. I feel like I wasted my time going to college for something that wasn't medical, IT or engineering. I have little to no talent. I have no skills nor hobbies aside from videogames -- which I now find more depressing than fun..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I feel like my depression has gotten worse the last year or so, and I don't know how much longer I can stand to bear it. I'm really just not happy with a single aspect of my life..and I fear that I'm not able to fix my situation. I'm 33M, and for the past..4-5 years now, I've been living with my mother in her small mobile home. My room is little more than 10x10 ft -- just enough room for a single mattress, a small nightstand and my tv. I don't have any closet space, so I hang my clothes on the shower and just remove them when I need to use it. Due to lack of space, it also doesn't feel like I'm able to express myself..the little room I have is used for necessity, not as a showcase for who I am -- though, if I'm being honest..I don't really feel like I know that person anyway -shrug.-

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Me and my mother have a bit of a strained relationship..We are very different people, don't share similar beliefs when it comes to a lot of different subjects, and while we love eachother, we really don't ""like"" one another.. she comes off as ""over positive"" at times while I'm just miserable.. which wears on both of us. She started seeing an abusive drunk when I was around 9. He would beat her, call her awful names..when I was 10-11 or so, he once had a conversation with me about how much of a whore she was and that I was whore trash. My grandparents got DCF involved at one point and he wasn't suppose to be coming around, but my mom would let him anyway and then tell me to lie to DCF or else they'd take me away -- great parenting, I know. He eventually went to jail and stopped drinking for a bit..but even off of alcohol, he was a mean bastard, very jealous and controlling. I suffered years of emotional and psychological abuse as a result.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For years, I always felt like I was walking on eggshells whenever I was home. From a very early age, I would detach and shelter myself from others, staying in my room with the door closed for hours, occasionally listening to him yelling at her or about me. Because of this, I was also very hesitant to ever bring people in to my life. I had friends and girlfriends, but I hardly ever let them come over -- we would need to hang out at their houses or go elsewhere. One time I had a friend sleep over, just for this piece of shit to start trouble in the middle of the night. Cops were called, and my friend (( who came from a perfectly loving home,)) pretty much stopped talking to me afterwards because they had been scared shitless. Part of me will never forgive her for that..She had plenty of opportunities to get rid of him, and yet always went back to him time and time again. I would think that the ordeal was finally over, just for her to eventually bring him back. Even to this day, despite having gotten divorced they remain ""friends."" She occasionally buys him groceries or runs him cigarettes and beer. Myself and my grandparents fully suspect they have a secret relationship..I truly do feel that I am the way I am today because of how damaging his presence in my life was. While I am not diagnosed, I fully suspect that I have PTSD, anxiety, social anxiety and mood swings. I also have thought for some time that I may be high functioning autistic or possibly have ADHD.

My father was never really present in my life..he was a drug dealer. When I was a baby, he would take me to the mall with him and sell coke out of the stroller / diaper bag. He ended up going to jail. When he got out, he would visit here and there..he always showed up with an expensive gift for my birthday or xmas. Even as a kid, I knew that these were means by which he was trying to ""buy my love,"" because he couldn't be bothered to gain it by actually being involved. I took it upon myself to start visiting him once a week in my early 20s to try to build a relationship. As a test, I stopped going after so many visits, just to see if he would put in the effort to see where I was. To this day he has never bothered to reach out. He never taught me anything, or mentored me, or introduced me to his passions. I was hardly an afterthought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hate my father.

As I've gotten older, my friend circle has dwindled to the point of being nonexistent. I use to rent with two of my oldest friends, one of which was my best friend growing up. Our mutual interests have grown far and few, and on more than one occasion it became pretty evident that they didn't really see me as much of a friend anymore. I'll never forget the time that they, along with some other friends, went to go see Joker and didn't bother to invite me. I didn't make a big deal out of it, but when they came home later that night and told me they went to go see it, I responded with something like "" Damn man, wish I had gotten an invite! I've been wanting to see it,"" to which my best friend responded, "" I thought I invited you but I guess not. Sorry, you're just forgettable."" Nowadays we're more old friends than best friends -- if you can even call us that. We occasionally play games together once and awhile, but the truth is that we really just aren't close anymore, and I think we're both well aware of that.After high school, I ended up meeting a girl who introduced me to the party scene, and a whole new social circle. I dropped out of college because I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life -- and I still don't. I partied for a few years, started getting in to trouble more often and eventually decided that I needed to fix myself -- so I joined the military. The military pulled me out of the party lifestyle long enough that I never went back, but it also put a strain on a lot of friendships and definitely ruined some relationships..leading to a smaller social circle. I eventually went back to college for communications. At the time, I had hoped to get in to marketing or sales, but I live in a small, dying county in the poor end of Massachusetts, and those types of jobs really just don't exist around here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I ended up working for a local newspaper for awhile making minimum wage as a night time copy editor. one thing led to another, and I now work for a courthouse making considerably more money -- but I hate the work. I deal with mostly angry people..people who are upset that they can't see their kids, or mad that their child support is so high. There is a lot to learn, and given all my past trauma, I find that I have a lot of brain fog and have a very, very hard time remembered the procedures for everything that I'm expected to help with. I did not go to school for law and have virtually 0 interest in it. I don't even like watching court TV. My forgetfulness and need to ask questions has begun wearing on my co-workers, to the point that I fear that someone(s) will eventually speak to management about my poor performance. The anxiety this all produces has led me to have an outburst of frustration at work on more than one occasion. I can tell my boss doesn't like me, and my co-workers feel I am incompetent. At 33, if I were to lose this job, I really don't know what I would even do to earn a comparable salary. Me moving out and having at least some semblance of a normal human life rests on me having this job.My talents are few, and I don't have any hobbies outside of playing videogames.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I use to enjoy making artwork in photoshop, creative writing and photography, but over the years those things have fallen to the way side -- Photoshop is expensive and cracked versions aren't as easy to come by, I feel that I've literally lost my ability to write creatively, and taking photos just feels awkward and weird when I have no one to tag along.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So..at 33, I have virtually no friends nor the means to meet new people. I have social anxiety and don't have hobbies nor a social circle to help me meet others. I live in a small room, in a trailer, with my mother -- which means that dating has been off the table for awhile. I am ridden with mental problems, am in danger of losing a job that I hate -- but feel the need to keep because it pays better than any other job I've had, and have nothing to fall back on should that ever happen. I owe about 13k in student loans, with only about 20k in the bank.. I had planned on saving up to 30k before starting to look for a mobile home of my own (( it beats renting..)) but loan forgiveness falling through has put me right back where I started nearly 2 years ago.",3,1,edit i told my mom tonight that things haven't been going so great at work and that i really feel like i just don't have the mind for the type of job that it is that i have a lot of brain

depression,o6fggo,Whatever happened in my city over the past few years took a huge toil on my mental health,"Brief introduction, I am a university student from Hong Kong (early 20s M). Watching your city fell at a front row seat apparently would kill your mental health. I suffered from depression and probably PTSD too. My whole life is a mess now. I have no hope of the future and of myself. I might even be self destructive with my own life.

Warning: A very long story incoming, and I am not good at expressing myself so it might feel clumsy or cocky, apologies in advance

A little bit of background, I suspect my mental health has never truly been well even when I was younger. I was the awkward kid in the school, I have difficulty socialising or expressing myself well. And I am not the hard working student too. As a result I used to be a target of bullying, never have many friends at school, not liked by teachers (might have felt I was a trouble) and while there were close friends I sometimes would felt there is distance between us (although they still turned out to be the closest friends I have now). As an added note, the secondary school I studied in was a relative prestigious one, so there was a ton of pressure to succeed in every aspect, especially academically and socially, and being competitive is a norm, which further made me feel shit.

Then came university life, which till this date I felt I chose the wrong university and wrong major. The university I am in was again a very competitive one. The school culture was all about academic achievements and competition. Everyone just talked about GPA or studying in the library or what stock to buy every other day. The culture also made the students apathetic to social and political issues. Oh and I should also mention the university have a relative high rate of suicide and depression and other metal health issues seem to affect many students. I felt very uncomfortable in the university as I was never very academical and I again don’t have many friends in the university. Even I tried hard to be “extrovert” and meet new people, few eventually became actual people that I would talk to regularly.

So, my mental health was no where near good even before 2019.

Then came the 2019 Hong Kong protest.

At the start everything looked so hopeful.  Then things turned south and there were clashes with the police every now and then. I started as a protestor but as things turned violent I found out I couldn’t do anything. Not brave or strong enough to fight. A sense of powerlessness.

Then an opportunity made me a student journalist, a role that made me feel safer (an illusion at the time probably). But shit went even worse, water cannon, tear gas canister, rubber bullet, blood everywhere.

Some days I woke up smelling tear gas or hearing explosions. Friends said I may have PTSD, but current situation meant I could never share those experiences with a psychologist.

Protest eventually died down, harder oppression came. Every time I looked at news there’s something bad, someone was arrested, some new law to oppress us, some news station have to close down.

It’s killing me. The sense of powerlessness and desperation. The whole city is grim. I don’t know how some people can turn a blind eye to everything or some can just move on. I couldn’t.

Everything is just a delusion that you’ve done something for change, in reality nothing’s changed and you can do nothing about it other than sit and watch.

Back to my life. All the work from being a student journalist meant I couldn’t care less about my academics. Not to mention even when I was free I couldn’t work on anything and waste my time in sadness, weeping in my bed or something. In this university where academics are so important, I am fucked. Everyone have internship or even grad job offer, I don’t even know if I can graduate or even carry on to study. My vastly different expectation to the university and my major also didn’t helped. I am not even sure if I want to work in this field or did I waste all my university years.

And then all the socio-political environment, the common social pressure HKers or Asian have didn’t help either. I am lost.

I realised I never mentioned my current mental health status or symptoms. I’ve had panic attacks, anxiety (to the point I could barely bear to go back to my university campus), I devalue myself and I distance myself from others to the point that I made people worry but I actually don’t want them to worry about me but I don’t know how to talk to them anymore. I even piss people off because I didn’t reply messages often enough because I couldn’t make myself to reply. I am such an escapist that I spend my time on entertainment to not think about anything anymore.

Fuck I am so helpless and such a jerk.

And I’ve tried stuff from school psychologist to self help, not anything work. I am trapped in a deteriorating state and an unending downward spiral.

depression,x55vac,"jumped off a boat and survived last month, entering long term treatment for mental health now","I had a cruise lined up and planned on committing suicide on the fifth day. Well, I couldn't wait, so I drank to black out and not feel the pain/remember and jumped off the top deck. I was swimming semi-conscious, black out drunk, 45 minutes in rough dark waters, and was found only because of my deflated life vest's reflection, which my GF told me to wear.

Yep, that's right. A 19 year old girl saved me, a 23 year old man's, life. I owe her the world for that. I'd take a bullet for that beautiful woman. 

Well, after jumping, I was on morphine for seven days. And Versed and Ativan in the clinic. I took Xanax and muscle relaxers on the drive to the port, to speed up the time and quiet the thoughts of a dying man. I had some of my brother's Xanax and Oxycodone on the way back. Then, tramadol at home. Then my dad gave me my old Xanax script twice a week. Then I got another Xanax script and Klonopin. And ordered Phenibut. I detoxed from Xanax and Phenibut 7 months ago, and here I was, doing them both. Alternated days between Xanax and Klonopin for a week, stayed up 20 hours playing Final Fantasy 5, and drank 12 shots. Woke up feeling like shit and more Klonopin.

I'm not going to count the suicide drinks or the drinking recently just to see if I could handle it, as one was in an episode and one was a teaching lesson. I'll still say I have 12 months on the anniversary of my DUI in 3 months, free from alcohol.

I took some Delta-8 today and started thinking about how much I want to end it. That I'm 23, I dropped out of college, I have been abused my entire childhood/adolescence, I have been r@ped, I have been stabbed and strangled, I have watched my mother overdose naked in front of me, I have been abandoned my father at 16 as my mother died. I been sexually assaulted. I ruined my life with drugs and alcohol, I've tried to take my life three times, I embarrassed myself and ruined my reputation by being in trauma/drug/insomnia induced psychosis. I have no friends, my entire family besides my two abusers died, no job, no school, no money, a DUI offender, stuck in a room all day with porn/games/TV/phone/music with a girlfriend he doesn't deserve - oh, and an applier of disability. Who is fighting addiction because a doctor prescribed him Ambien at 15, then 4 mg Xanax daily at 17, then Adderall, then Soma, then all four at the same time. That gave your mother the drugs that killed her. That gave your brother the pills he's addicted to, that could kill him. That got me hooked on benzos at FIFTEEN. That got an entire family on drugs. 

I don't want this to be my life. I don't want to be 30, sitting in my messy ass room playing video games. I don't want to see someone I know the rare time I leave my house and have to lie about what I've been up to. I don't want to lose my girlfriend. I don't want to drink. I don't want to abuse benzos. I don't want to watch porn and fucking cry. I don't want to make excuses and be angry and be complacent. I don't want to resent people. I don't want to be doing stupid shit and getting in more legal trouble. I don't want to play the victim forever and blame other people. Yes I got fucked, as in literally (r@pe). But it's my responsibility to get better, not the blame and make excuses. 

So, this begins the real stage of recovery. The first time, I thought maybe I'm not addict, maybe I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not that bad, I'm just depressed. No, I know now that I am an alcoholic/addict, that I have a higher power (whatever saved me) and that I need AA. That I need to get help, that I need to turn around.

I'm checking myself into a 90 day mental health residential treatment program in two weeks.

I cannot go on like this. Yes, I have perservered and endured this entire time and self-educated my fears and traumas, and anxiety and angst and self-hatred, but I have never ACTED. I have never changed. I may have gotten better, but I was complacent. I simply ""got by"". I stayed just barely alive, sleeping most of the time, for months. 

Now is the time for change.

I am at a crossroads. There are two entities of me in the future. 

One, I am 30 years old, living in my dad's basement still. I have no friends, unless they are online or from work, from a shitty part time restaurant job I work at while receiving SSI/SSDI benefits. I don't show up to my HS reunion because of how pathetic I would look. I've had another DUI or two. I have even less money. I'm drinking and doing drugs constantly. I'm hanging around shitty people. I'm playing video games all the time, ignoring all obligations.

In the second, I am 30 years old with a nice small house or apartment with my current girlfriend, who  has many years clean like myself. I went back to college and completed my last 60 credit hours for my bachelor's. I learned how to cope with life, find myself, address trauma, address my fears and self-hatred during my 90 day stay, and along the way discovered my true passion. I am walking along the beach with my beautiful woman and my loving pup. I am enjoying the little things, like movies. I'm at my high school reunion, telling one I went on a long detour in life, but came back and overcame all my obstacles, finding the last bit of fight I had left in me to survive. I'll tell my story and how I nearly died and how I get better... I'll be handsome and in shape, peaceful, happy, having overcome my traumas and addiction. I may even have an Anon Jr... 

I want the second. I NEED the second. I cannot go the other way. Harrowingly, a classmate in the 12th grade told me this: ""you're either going to end up dead, or a clean cut businessman"". How someone can be so wise behind their years is beyond me. But he is right. 

It is either I dig my feet in willlpower and learn to live a fulfilling life full of love and passion with these diseases, or I end up with a 3rd DUI, drunk in a basement playing Smash, alone, with a noose lying in the spare room. 

And, as corny as it sounds, I understand AA after hating it for so long. I have to do this with my faith. Faith that I will get better. Faith that my mother is my guardian angel, the one who saved me during my ODs and my jump. Faith that I can do this, and that I am strong enough. 

It will take a long time, and has taken long enough. From abusive relationships to domestic abuse to drug abuse and addiction and traumatic experiences, from jail, rehab, psych wards and a dark room, from loneliness and drugs and alcohol, I will arrive at my destination. It took me years to quit alcohol. It took me years to go to rehab. 

I wasn't ready, but I wanted to get better. My last bit of hope had me check in. And I almost checked out that night, but my only strength kept me swimming 45 minutes, choking on rough dark waters, nearly drowning, until I was rescued. It kept me from killing myself between then and now.

I am ready now. The bullshit has to stop somewhere. I am not getting any younger. I will get better. I will spend every day trying to make myself the man my girlfriend needs and deserves, a happy man, a strong man, a loving man. I, at this very moment, am in death's vice grip. And I will fight it until the very end. 

My only recourse is that I am doing this at 22/23. I could have let this go on for so much longer. Not every addict is self aware at that age. Not everyone has the resources. I WILL BEAT THIS.

There will be no more bullshit restaurant jobs. No more shitty friends and girls. No more loneliness and isolation. No more room scattered with alcohol bottles. No more self-hatred and self-destruction. No more benders. No more sitting in a room. No more porn, phone and video games all day. No more sleeping all day.

I WILL DO THIS. I was strong enough to make it back on the boat. I fought fucking HARD, it is a miracle my black out drunk ass didn't drown, although multiple times I felt that was imminent and I barely resurface. If I have THAT strength, I have the strength to defeat this. 

It will be my greatest test, but it will be passed. I will find happiness. I will reach back out to help someone out when I'm better. 

Thank you.

depression,13k8813,My Parents don’t understand my mental health problems.,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health the past 6 months. I started noticing the struggles in my job which was going downhill. I worked as a customer service analyst in a biscuit factory. We had no manager or team leader for 3 months before I had a breakdown and 8 members of staffed left since I started in October 2022. We were down to 4 team members left in 12 office team and the company didn’t hire anyone quickly. I felt stressed and depressed going to work. Eventually I had a mental breakdown because I felt I was doing the job of 5 people. 
I spoke to one of the head managers and nothing changed within a month. I had no choice but to leave the company immediately due to my mental health getting worse. I would come home crying and stressed. It wasn’t the place to be. 

My mum and step dad were disappointed, they call me a job hopper for leaving when things go wrong but this was the worst it has been. I even self referred myself for therapy it was so bad. 

It has been 8 weeks since I’ve left and job hunting has been a nightmare. A few interviews here and there, but usually rejection. I was fortunate to quit on the spot as I have accrued savings. I live at home, and they push me to find a job as soon as possible but that adds more stress. I feel useless at the age of 22. Therapy helped but I was discharged after 6 sessions. Not long after that my cat of 20 years passed away 3 weeks ago. I feel I am experiencing grief and loss of job all at once. 


I try to explain my point of view to them, but they say I should “suck it up” or “that’s life”. 

I recently went to the doctors to explain my symptoms and had bloods done. All came back normal. He suggested I have anxiety and depression, which I believe. I’ve told my mum what the doctor said but she seems to dismiss it. 

I’m trying my best to get out of the rut, but it just seems so impossible. One day I hope to get the right job and move out to be happy.

I felt like they were concerned that I had no long term goals, suggesting this is more short-term. But for me it isn't. I've been dealing with severe anxiety combined with depression for 10 years and at this point I have reached my lowest. This is long-term for me. I get a bit better, then I drop again, often lower than before.

I desire little to nothing else but to not feel this way. I know it's helpful to have long-term goals but why can others not seem to grasp that I can't even think ""long-term"" feeling this way.

depression,12y86zs,Dealing with your mental health when you can't see your counselor.,"Hello, friends. I hope you are doing well. 

I (24M) have been going to therapy to deal with my generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I've been seeing my current counselor for four months. The university has a community clinic where you can get therapy for $5. The counselors are graduate students, so you're kinda helping them prepare to be therapists. 

Anyway, this week will be my last session with my counselor. :( Then the clinic will be closed for May and open back up in June, and I'll be assigned a new counselor. I'm sad to say goodbye to this counselor, but I'm happy for her to be moving on with her education. 

To help me get through a month without counseling sessions, I'm looking for some advice on dealing with depression and anxiety. I think it'll be good to have some extra tools not just for these gaps, but also between sessions. 

Some things that currently help me are journaling, listening to music, walking, cleaning, and drawing. I do struggle with dealing with my anxiety and depression in the moment. When I'm at work, for example, my whole body feels tight or I'll feel a sudden wave of sadness and want to walk off and cry. I try to use breathing techniques when I'm feeling anxious, but I'm not consistent. Sometimes I just ride the wave of anxiety and sadness until it's over or at the very least it's not bothering me as much. I don't know how healthy that is.

depression,13phc67,Unemployed due to mental health and lying about it to people because I feel ashamed,"
I have never been able to work a job longer than a few weeks because of my mental health. I suffer with social and generalized anxiety disorders since early childhood. I just turned 27 and I feel so embarrassed about it. I finished college last year and only accepted one job which lasted a month because my mental health couldn't handle it. Most people still think I'm working there. Only a handful know I'm unemployed. I have little money which my family gives me and people keep asking me to do things with them that I can't really afford to do but don't want to tell them the truth of my situation. 

I'm terrified for my future and what to do. I don't find counseling any help and the doctor only prescribes meds for the physical symptoms of anxiety. Everyone else seems to be moving on with their life and I just feel stuck. I'm riddled with anxiety and depression and honestly just hate myself and my life. I just don't know what to do.

depression,123cvxx,My physical and mental health has been wrecked since I quit drinking 5 months ago,"
I’m 28M. My symptoms mostly started right before I was hospitalized for electrolytes and palpitations after extended binge drinking in October 2022. Was an alcoholic for years previously and quit immediately after. Since then it has been hell with PVCs, dizziness with walking, orthostatic hypotension, extreme fatigue, and hypogonadism (I cannot get an erection anymore and have no desire to date, my T levels are almost as low as the average woman’s T levels). I deal with near constant pain in my upper right and sometimes upper left abdomen.

These symptoms are not getting better and I think it’s cirrhosis as these are all cirrhosis symptoms and I’ve been fucking up my liver with alcohol since I was 16 yet every liver/abdomen test I’ve had so far (ultrasound, shear wave liver elastography, liver blood work, abdominal noncontrast CT) continues to come back normal aside from a mildly enlarged spleen and gallstone. I ask my GI docs what the abdomen pain is if it’s not my liver and they’re just basically like “I don’t know, probably IBS!” And send me on my way. Even my PCP doesn’t know wtf to do with me and just refers me to specialists. Even though those tests aren’t perfect and do miss cirrhosis sometimes (rare I know, but possible), my family thinks I’m CRAZY for still thinking I might have liver disease and thinks all these symptoms are in my head or something not from the liver. Well then tell me what the fuck else has caused all these symptoms to come out of the blue after prolonged binge drinking??? Nobody has an answer.

My life has been hell. I am almost done with third year of medical school and I almost certainly am going to have to take a leave of absence and maybe even drop out if things don’t get better. My girlfriend of two years who was my best friend left me and is living a much better life now traveling and having fun, while walking to the fucking grocery store is a challenge for me now. And my brother who used to be my best friend blew his brains out 2 years ago so now I don’t have him to talk to anymore. 

Going to sleep is now my favorite part of the day. In my dreams I’m skiing, fishing, dating girls, treating patients, hanging with my brother again, and doing the things I used to love. Then I wake up and wonder if I’m going to fucking collapse running errands that day and hear my family tell me how my symptoms are all in my head and how I’m becoming a failure. Or I have intrusive thoughts that I have undiagnosed varices that might burst and I die vomiting up my blood.

depression,12anihp,Should I take a month off school to focus on my mental health??,"I am currently in a graduate level program set to graduate in Dec 2023. I have struggled with my mental health specially anxiety and depression for over 10 years now and have yearly cycles of depression episodes usually spanning from a few weeks to 1-3 months. This year particularly has been very difficult with my depressive phase beginning in January and has only gotten increasingly worse to cope with.  I check off all the symptoms of depression and anxiety and feel a huge sense of numbness and apathy to almost every part of my life. I check off all the symptoms of depression and anxiety. I am currently in therapy every week and am working with my doctor to begin medication. 

In a few weeks I will be starting a 5-week 5 day a week placement block which requires a lot of energy and planning outside of school. I am very stressed about this since my depression has been so bad these past few months, getting out of bed isn’t even possible some days. Over the past few weeks I’ve only made it to school 1-2 times (I am required to go 3 times a week). 

I discussed options with my program director and there is an option to delay my placement until the next placement block from sept-Nov and the next one from Jan-Mar 2024. My program’s graduation isn’t until May 2024 so I would still be able to graduate with my cohort however, this would delay my school finish date for a few months. 

I am still on the fence and during the moments I feel okay and motivated I think I can do it but sometimes hours later I wouldn’t even be able to do simple tasks like brush my teeth or write an email. I am trying to fight my inner thoughts of feeling like a failure for not being able to complete the program as scheduled. I also fear the judgement from others as although I know this is not helpful I feel my depression and anxiety issues are not caused by a good enough reason. 

On one hand, the month off could be a really good time to get my routines, habits, and mental health better. However I also worry that the time off will put my into a deeper state of depression with more time on my hands to “do nothing”. I find the days I have to myself to rest and be productive are anything but that and I don’t trust myself being alone.

depression,eophbs,I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.,"Why does this happen to me.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading.

a in my mocks before this unfolded so it s so frustrating since i didn t do too well in my last mock due to my parents death a few days before my nd mocks started now i m struggling to stay in my high sets then there s my social life as i said it s hard to do anything since i live far my original town around an hour away side track i used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of me motivated me to lose weight age kg to age kg which i was proud off but that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster i gained weight and now i m age months away from kg and one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could ve taken my she had a high paying job but she didn t want to take care of kid she s married and has a child she was also a social worker however i forgot to mention it was this women this women who i confided in someone i though was my hope she was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when i turn she betrayed me and made it seems as though i fabricated this lie so i could move out she promised me to wait till i turned so i had a choice in my life but nope she couldn t wait first of all i wasn t the only one raped other kids were also raped by him they both told my aunty but to save face they threatened the other two because they re still they re more likely to listen i didn t therefore the reason i was tortured i hate her with all my life my only hope turned into my biggest disappointment police gave up due to the lack of testimony whole family conspired against me in addition to my social life as i mention i was bullied my whole childhood i was a fat kid who didn t know how to socialise becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me mentally or physically and because i wasn t popular my best friend pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn t school i was still naive then he betrayed me twice in high school i ended our friendship years ago after the nd time i trusted him and he betrayed me a few weeks after that i met a new person who was a really good friend that was when his cousin wasn t around his cousin lied framed me racist comment weird even though we re the same race but still i didn t even say it i proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all i did was say the same thing back and what my friend did was support him that infuriated me since i knew he was supporting him and sat next thing what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone i didn t end my friendship with this person but i did drift off from him i then met a person who was a genuine nice person we had a good couple of months but his parents were strict so we couldn t hang out much and we ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone i would trust i also met another genuine person he was a new kid and he is now my best friend i think it was weird because i never expected it to happen since he was popular i was just well a student even we re close and talk quiet a bit but i always feel uncomfortable with him he never answers me with full sentences doesn t talk to me when we re with out group of friends but i do know he cares for me as a friend but a lot of the time i think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other is that he never would ve bothered speaking to me in fact he s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends the thing our group of friends aren t like friend but just nice people in my perspective its like we re friends only when the other person is here if u get what i mean it honestly is so fucked up me i only have what like a month to my gcse and all i am is depressed down i have never once been happy this year actually that was a life the only thing that makes me happy is anime i ve developed an anime addiction ever since age this was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so i went upstairs to watch movies until i stumbled onto anime the only good thing i can think of is that in mo the i turn which means i ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers i ll be in a new town in a new school i ll be in college and i ll be able to start a fresh start but still looking how my life is it feels like i m meant to have a hard life it doesn t help that i m an atheist because that means i m not able to rely on someone with belief i ve never had a true true friend my education is pretty much ruin i m literally on my own my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can t find any more placements it s so fucking frustrating honestly is it just that some people have a hard life i ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that i ve dozed of many time on the bus i just can t care anymore all i want now is to become rich and take over the world without any selfish desires i just want to truly make this world better because it doesn t look like anyone is gonna help me i ve tried got hurt many

depression,y9w5il,HELP - Am I addicted to trying to fix myself / my mental health ?!,"Hey guys,

so here's the deal: I had depression, anxiety (especially fear of abandonment) and it really f\* up my life. So I really wanted to get out of it. And I kinda did. I read a lot about all those topics (mental health, attachment styles, depression, anxiety etc etc.), listened to podcast, watched videos, researched A LOT, also got into Yoga, Meditation, Spirituality (theoretical and practical). 

And hey, it helped. At one point I got myself out of the hole and I'm productive again. The thing is: I'm always in fixing mode. I can't do anything without connecting it to improving myself. I have all these strategies I read about in my mind like don't identify with your thoughts, but in the end all those strategies put so much pressure on myself that I can't enjoy anything. Like when I'm walking with my dog... I'm trying to be in the present (PRESSURE). When I'm reading a book, trying to figure out what my problem is (PRESSURE). Etc. etc. It feels like I'm never just LIVING. 

In the end I kinda assume that trying to fix my mental health became a problem itself. Like my brain is looking for a solution, but my problem is the brain.

And even knowing that, I don't know how to get out of it???

Did anyone experience this? Anyone has an advice?

PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY. 

I have been taking this asthma/allergy medication for about 3 months. 

I have a history of depression, anxiety,  and OCD for which I have been taking medication for many years. It’s been under control. Entirely controlled. 

For the last few months I have been fighting depression, my anxiety has been through the roof, I’ve made poor decisions/lacked executive function, been *extremely* anxious, I barely ate for 2 months, my sleep has been a mess, I’ve felt listless and out of it and I’ve been emotionally unstable. 

Come to find out that Singular (generic: montelukast) is supposed to come with a label warning of possible moderate to severe mental health side effects, and that physicians are supposed to discuss this prior to prescribing. 

I was never warned and the bottle has never carried a warning. My PCP overlooked this (not here to discuss this failing) and the pharmacist also overlooked it. 

I have been off it for a few days now and already feel like a different person. 
I looked up “Singulair” in this sub and see posts 2-8 years back of people concerned about depression who also were taking Singulair. 
I am sharing this in the hope to help someone/anyone else who may be unaware and struggling.

depression,125aerq,Retail vs. Pub Job and Mental Health,"Hello, 26[F] from London, UK. I'm interviewing for two jobs this week. One with a retail store and one with a pub but I'm trying to decide which I'd be best suited to. My previous job history was working in an art gallery, doing social media and ambassadorships at university.


I've been out of proper employment for about 5 years due to my poor mental health. I'm bipolar type one with treatment resistant depression and I suffer from anxiety disorders as well as agoraphobia. So I've known I'm not very reliable when it comes to mind mood if I'm in a bad way. I'm doing a bit better now and really need some work.


The retail job is low pressure but I'd have to commute to central London which makes me very anxious as I have a particular anxiety around travel. But the pub job is more local but it could be subject to a higher pressure environment. And more difficult customers. 


In an ideal world I would choose retail locally but that's not an option. So I was wondering which would serve me best given my condition. A friend mentioned that I'd meet a lot of people at the pub which is a plus for me as that's also part of my motivation for working is to make friends. I know people say that retail is the worst but this is a higher end company that also sells home goods. So it's not as stressful as somewhere like Primark for example.


I was also wondering, which environment is best for if I'm having a bad day or something. talking to my therapist she said she'd be fine with someone not all happy and smiley at the pub as long as the service is good. but in retail I don't know if I could get away with that.

depression,11vo1tg,"My mental health is tearing me apart, and I fear it might end my marraige"," 

Lately my mental health has spiralled completely out of control. I feel really depressed and have experienced my first anxiety attack ever. Ever since I finished my degree I've been financially stressed but kept my just above water. Now this is my first time posting ever, and also I'm just so confussed about everything so sorry if this doesn't really makes sense.

Recently though it feels as if my life is falling completely apart. My wife, the love of my life, and I do LARP with our group. Now, last time we went I got really tired, and we ended up having a fight when we got back home from the event. And that fight became the drop that made my glass overflow. My ex and I broke up after a LARP event because we had a fight and she ended up cheating on me, it wasn't very pretty and has left me with a fear of being left behind and loosing people.

During the last event we went to, my wife's character got engaged to one of our very good friends' character. That on top of the fight, have apparently reignited my fears from my former trauma of the way my ex left me. They have been doing forum rp daily ever since the event so that their characters can get to know each other better; something we generally do in the group, but the added romantic relationship between my wife and friends' characters. At the same time, because of my fears I have started growing slightly possessive and am really working with that issue as well as the other issues I have. We've spent some time apart to try and deal with my fear of not being with her, in case she might leave then, and are currently apart again while she's gone to visit some friends.

During these days however, it feels as if she's been withdrawing from me, not really answering me proberly or outright choosing to not engage with me in regards to any forum play we've been doing or in general, while I know she's been continuing with her own forumplay. My mind continues to make all sorts of scenarioes that scares me and just makes me want to have her in front of me and tell me she still loves me.

My depression and anxiety is growing worse, but I'm also afraid that if I keep communicating that to her, she'll grow annoyed and not want to spend time with me.  
I also have an appointment lined up with my doctor, as that might allow me to get financial aid with some therapy, but that is two weeks off and I feel as if I might crack any moment. I really don't know what to do and just need somewhere to vent. I've begun having these thoughts whether I'd just be saving us both a lot of pain by just running off and cutting ties to everything and starting over somewhere.. It's as if no matter what solution I'm thinking of there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I just have this fear that no matter how hard I try it's going to go wrong and she'll end up growing tired with the hardship anyway and end it..

depression,vtwzip,Rant: Anyone's loved ones ever try to backseat drive their mental health issues?,"**tl;dr: I was initially going to post this on the r/n24 sub which has to do with a longer than average circadian rhythm that fucks up having a lot of what people would consider a normal life. So if you see mentions here or there of n24 or sleep schedules-- that's what's up.**

**not much about n24 but yes, I've spent the last 2.5 years or so in free fall sleep-wise-- normally in a 25-28 hour rhythm even though I never really charted. But it sucks when there's a lot of co-morbidities like depression, anxiety, adhd (and grief.) And now my husband is bringing up bipolar disorder again (last time was maybe 4 or 5 years ago) and it sucks because now I question ever moment of happiness-- extra sucky because I've been in a deep, dark depression largely due to massive fucked up external shit (not working. covid. mom with dementia. dad and mom heavy into GOP/catholicism clusteruck. Aunt sucking my mom into Qanon crap. Dog who was central to my life traumatically dying.) On the plus side, I did big girl shit today and installed my own car stereo and the music makes my soul feel so much lighter. But it sucks because my husband would just use my *very evident* happiness today as an example of mania/mood cycling.**

I have depression and anxiety. I am 99% certain I have ADHD due to (among other things) how perfectly Executive Function Disorder and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria matches feelings that I previously didn't have the words for.

My husband's family has a history of Bipolar disorder, maybe schizophrenia, co-dependency, and narcissism. My parents weren't perfect but my husband got absolutely fucked over by his family.

He's learned more about bipolar disorder because:

his dad maybe has it (uncle definitely does),

he's afraid he has it (I'm 99% certain he doesn't),

but probably most of all, he he brought up a couple of times in the past that he thinks I have it.

Now, I'm not the most mentally healthy person in the world, and I have spent a lot of time on introspection (probably too much-- spending too much time in your head trying to figure out what's wrong with you often has your brain start making shit up to make you feel bad about yourself.) I openly admit: I have problems.

But I'm starting to get a little fucking pissed. (not because there's anything wrong with having a form of bipolar. I will be bringing it up with a therapist when I eventually go, and continue reading about it, but the symptoms of various bipolar disorders don't fit except where depression, adhd, and grief obviously explain. And I'm trying to be understanding because my husband and I are in a separation, and a lot of it stems from my depression. (short story: haven't worked since the pandemic started. got stuck for a year and a half with my parents who are crazy GOP/Catholic loons who were a-o.k. with the insurrection attempt. Mom's got early stages of dementia. Dad's early to medium stages of senile. Then my best friend, my dog (my dog was my best friend, not two separate entitites) of 14 years died traumatically.

depression,mqr8ny,It's hard to talk about mental health issues with people who have never experienced one,"Hi everyone, I'm sorry to bring up this topic which I find extremely complicated, but it's something that I find very hard to deal with.   
Besides struggling with depression for years, I have anxiety disorder and OCD, which is quite normal because they are all comorbid. The thing is that I know that most of my problems come from that and I often don't find people to talk about my problems with because I feel they don't really understand how misserable I feel. I know everyone on earth has at some point experienced anxiety or mild depression at some point, but that happens usually to most people for a short period of time or motivated by a punctual reason (break ups, loss, stress, whatever).   
My point here is that when you feel this way everyday of your life and with no reason besides your brain being fucked up it's a whole different situation than having experienced it for a short period of time, and that makes it very very hard to share it with most people (at least with my closest friends), specially because they try to relate to you by saying things like ""I understand you, I've felt down before"", but like it's not like I just feel down, I literally want to die every single day of my life because being alive sucks and I won't change my mind about it because living with a voice inside your head telling you that everything is worthless or making you doubt on everything goes far beyond from just feeling sad or unmotivated.   
I feel like lots of people have a very supperficial concept of what depression is, or long lasting anxiety and obsesive thoughts, and that's one reason why I stopped talking to my friends about how I feel, I feel missunderstood.

Tomorrow I’m going back for a full 5 days in a row and even though I’m doing much better and thought I was ready, the thought of going in tomorrow and for the rest of the week is making me so panicky and I can’t stop crying :( I can’t keep taking time off work to sit on the couch I need to go to work and I also can’t cancel because I work with clients and cancelling on them can mess up my whole career (definitely not helping with the stress part.)

depression,y6p87r,I need some advice regarding my mental health,"Hi people,  

I knew it was going to come to this point, but apparently, I never learn from my past. I am an exchange student for a year with a university in another country. I managed to get a scholarship and because of my ego, I decided to go and put up all this fake bravado that I am really excited about. The thing is that during the past year I was experiencing some signs of mild depression like lack of motivation, constant fatigue, lack of sleep, restraining my social life to close friends, and always gaming and drinking. Still, I pulled through the university year with great grades.  

Now, this is not my first experience studying abroad. The first time I was at my lowest point before coming back and it took me around half of a year to recover (won't go into details about what happened, but the only thing keeping me away from the edge was substance abuse).  

I wanted to get my mental health in order before coming here, but couldn't find a spot at one of my friend's therapists and I also postponed it a lot thinking that it will pass.  Now, I am on the verge of collapsing, my time management sucks, my diet sucks, I can't sleep more than a few hours per night, I am drinking daily and the only things that make me push myself are the assignments deadlines and the thought of failing which would mean paying back the scholarship (almost 10k) and taking an extra year back home.  

I saw that the university I am currently at has free psychologists on campus and I was thinking of giving them a try. I have no idea where else to go as I am not in an English-speaking country and the language barrier is a pretty big issue in daily life outside uni. It is either that or sucking it up for 8 more weeks until I come home and recharge my batteries. From my personal experience, I really disliked all the therapists I went to so far since I was a kid and I don't want to start taking pills besides maybe something to help me sleep. I always tried to work on myself and fix the issues, but honestly, I am at the end of my strength and I acknowledge that I need help. Coming back home isn't an option as I already missed a third of my home university semester and my accommodation contract here binds me legally to pay the entire rent even if I cancel it which is around 6K.  

What would you advise me to do? I usually don't ask for feedback from strangers, but I really don't want to worry my family and close friends. Also, I pretty much know the causes of my mental health decline as I am kinda analytic of myself, but I don't have the energy to overcome and deal with them.

depression,g99heb,Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

depression,yoi8dz,Mental health in relation to how good your life situation is,"Here is a thought I have been thinking about lately. I used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation - if you don't have friends, no job, don't have hobby's, don't have money, don't have a partner, have a poor family situation,.. it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression. However, recently I had a thought that that might not be quite the truth. I think what could be the real problem, leading to mental health disorders, is that it's not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems, nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life, it's that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck. I mean that, you don't find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on, so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation, leading to worry and anxiety/depression. And so it's not per se your life situation quality, or the fact that you are stuck, but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble. 

For example, if someone with a mental health disorder, takes a long vacation, that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation, but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere. 

As another example, there are people with a decent life situation: good financial situation, kids, good relationships,.. but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area, and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life, and starts to absorb all their thinking. It's like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody.",1,1,here is a thought i have been thinking about lately i used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation if you don't have friends no job don't have hobby's don't have money don't have a partner have a poor family situation it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression however recently i had a thought that that might not be quite the truth i think what could be the real problem leading to mental health disorders is that it's not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life it's that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck i mean that you don't find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation leading to worry and anxiety depression and so it's not per se your life situation quality or the fact that you are stuck but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble for example if someone with a mental health disorder takes a long vacation that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere as another example there are people with a decent life situation good financial situation kids good relationships but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life and starts to absorb all their thinking it's like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody,0.08715079365079363,-0.9156,NEGATIVE,0.9991962313652039,positive,negative,negative

depression,x4b7jy,How to support mental health in relationship?,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been dating for almost a year. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for 10 years and am in a good place with my mental health right now. My boyfriend also struggles with depression, and also has for around 10 years. We're both in therapy and on medication, and have been for a while. My boyfriend has been having a low couple of months.

My boyfriend's depressive symptoms include lethargy (lying in bed for most of the day, not doing the dishes), a nihilistic outlook (our generation is doomed and nothing is worthwhile), and mild anger / irritability. He also doesn't like to talk about his mental state when he's doing poorly, I believe avoidance / numbing is how he's coped with his depression and past trauma.

When I see him like this, I just want to make him feel better. I grew up managing my family's emotions, so I know I have people-pleasing and perfectionistic tendencies. I over-empathize with others' feelings, sometimes personalize them / think I'm the cause of them, and naturally assume responsibility for making other people feel better.

How can I best support my boyfriend when these depressive symptoms are happening? I ask him how he's feeling, and what he needs, and don't get much response. When I feel bad, I like it when he just spends time with me, so I try to do that, and just be there with him; like, we cuddle and get food. And how can I best be there for myself during this time? I constantly second-guess whether I'm actually helping him, or if I'm just trying to make myself feel better and annoying him in the process. It's also not pleasant to spend time with him or talk to him when he's very reactive. How can I balance being around him and supporting him while he's going through this?

To be clear, I love him very much, and I think our relationship is very healthy generally. He's very supportive of me, we communicate well, we have a lot of fun together. I love him a lot.

depression,y83xkj,Research Assistant in Public Health Feeling Stuck in His Career; In Need of Advice,"**Note: This is a very rough draft, so I hope you'll bear with me as you read through this; I will edit and revise this as people ask clarifying questions in the comments section.**

Hi! I'm a 27M currently working in public health as a Research Assistant. For quite some time, I've been feeling worn out, stuck, and am not sure where to move forward in my career. I don't feel safe at work (i.e., I don't feel that I can speak my mind), and I don't know who I can trust or have anyone in the workplace that I trust with whom to confide in. I was not always in the mental headspace that I was in, and lately I've been reflecting and perplexed on how I got to where I am now. What went wrong? Was it my personality? Was it my inability to let things go? Were my feelings not valid given the situation that I was in, and did I inappropriately respond to said feelings? Was I just not thick-skinned enough (and if people have advice on how to be more thick-skinned in the comments section, please let me know). Was I just too immersed in my feelings and should have worked on separating my feelings from the rest of myself and just ""done my job""?

When I first started my job, I was not in the mental state that I am currently in. I was bright eyed and bushy tailed, eager and hungry for work. When I was given my first project, I put together a more or less functioning survey tool in two days. The truth is, I was probably pulling two 12-hour days to get that done, working a second job at night, at the time, I was very focused and motivated. My predecessor at the time, who was working with me for a brief moment before she transitioned to graduate school, said that I did a good job, especially given the circumstances (working remotely during COVID-19). My manager had even come to me and communicated that my boss said that ""I was the right person for the job"". Things were going pretty well at my job for the first five months or so. I was sitting comfortably in meetings and felt as if I was treated as an equal, or at the very least positively regarded by my colleagues. Then I made a mistake, a big one.

At the day of project launch, I asked my manager if she wanted to clear the ""test data"" in the survey tool before it was published. She said ""Yes,"" but that was assuming that all the data in the tool was test data. What I did not account for at the time, was that people were already taking the survey, so I could have inadvertently deleted real data. It was a miscommunication and had I thought things through a little more or sought clarification, I probably would not have moved ahead with the deletion of the data and just left it. When I let my manager know, she was not happy about that and was quite harsh about it. We tried different ways to fix it, but when we couldn't, we went to our boss. Our boss was especially not happy about it and said that she didn't know what to say except that she was ""disappointed"". For the next two weeks or so, my boss gave me the cold shoulder. I felt ostracized by my team and no longer felt as though I were a member of my team of equal consideration. It felt incredibly lonely. I did apologize to my boss, and she did accept my apology and said we could move on, but it never really felt as though people moved on during that project period (or perhaps I did not move on; ***input regarding this would be much appreciated***). I think my manager was still frustrated with me at this time, and while in the data collection phase, she was making requests quite regularly in a given day. I was feeling overwhelmed and was working longer than 8 hour days and taking 10 minute lunch breaks. I did not feel comfortable telling her that I was feeling overwhelmed give the recent mistake, so I just kept chugging along. I'm not sure if my discomfort was valid, or if it was due to my anxiety. Maybe it was a little bit of both. As a result of me just feeling overwhelmed and just feeling the overall negative energy of my team towards me (whether imagined or real is hard to tell, possibly might have both), I was making careless mistakes here and there, which probably exacerbated my manager's frustration.

Fast forward several months, there came a time when a higher-level manager came to me and asked if I had given any thought to moving to the city/state where my job was located. I was working remotely at the time and living with my parents, given the pandemic. I thought it was a casual inquiry, but in fact, our employer was requesting that all out-of-state employees move onsite due to state tax issues. The manager said that she did want to be inflexible and asked what month would work for me to move onsite. We established that moving by August was reasonable and to aim for that.

I went to my manager about this and talked more about moving dates. After some discussion, she said that it would be ideal if I could move by May or June ( I can't remember how the discussion led to this, but I guess I was discussing a more firm deadline just so that I could plan accordingly; August was a loose deadline when I discussed with the higher level manager). I must be a terrible negotiator, as my timeline for moving was suddenly moved to June, which was just four months from our conversation. When I tried to discuss this more with my manager and expressed concerns about financial issues, she got frustrated, and said that there has been a lot of back and forth with my salary, with asking questions about tasks, and now with this moving issue and that it was not a productive use of time. She said that my financial concerns were a nonissue, as I knew what the salary was when I took the job, and flipped out. I just stopped talking about it after that. However, the financial issues were not the only issue on my plate. My dad had recently lost his job during COVID, and my mother was supporting the two of them between her salary (which is not much more than mine, think a little over $20/hour) and my father's unemployment. Moving at the time was a great financial and emotional strain for both me and my parents. Also, when I resigned myself to moving, I soon found out that it was not easy to find housing for June in February or June in general (the city my job is located in revolves around the academic cycle, so most apartments are available when the school semester starts). I was also still working two jobs at the time, so I was essentially working from 9 am (sometimes earlier) to 5 pm at my Research Assistant job and working from 5 - 8 pm at my second job. Sometimes, my second job would run late, so I would sometimes be working till 10 - 11 pm. Afterwards, I'd be staying up till 2 am - 3 am browsing through Craigslist and Facebook for apartment listings, without much luck, just to wake up at 6 - 7 am in the morning to begin the work cycle again. I was working my second job on weekends as well, so I didn't really have a lot of free time.

My manager did come to me the next week and said that based on the discussions at our leadership workshop (our department hired an external group to run a month long leadership workshop), that how she spoke to me during our discussion about moving the week prior was not the best, and asked if there was a way we could improve our working relationship. However, I didn't know what to say to her. How could I tell her that what she said to me the week prior was *insensitive*? I didn't think I could talk to my manager in that way, so I just said that I would get back to her but never did. I could never find a diplomatic way to discuss the topic, so I did not say anything at all. After reflecting on the conversation more at the time, I feel that my manager was apologizing for how she said what she said rather than the content (e.g. moving was still more or less nonnegotiable, at least that's how it came off to me at the time). Thinking back, I think that if I did bring up my challenges of moving, perhaps I would have been able to negotiate my move-in date, but at that point, I had already felt that I lost my voice and felt disempowered. I tried advocating for myself, and it felt that I was shut down, so I didn't bother trying further, at the risk of more conflict and discomfort.

At some point soon after my discussion with my manager, I had a discussion with a higher up manager and asked her for feedback on me as an employee (it was an activity for the leadership workshop). At some point, the move was discussed, and she said that they (the department, my manager, etc.) felt that it was reasonable to ask for a June move-in date given that the project was starting at that time and that they might need me on-site. She said she was willing to help me with leads for housing, which was nice of her, and that there should be lots of openings for June. As nice and civil as the higher-level manager was, it was still disheartening to hear given my circumstances mentioned in the previous paragraph, but I didn't say anything, as at that point, I just resigned myself to moving.

My parents told me that I had options, that I could quit my job. I guess I was too stubborn at the time and didn't hear them. Hearing that I could quit my job was disheartening because I had spent a whole year searching for jobs, and this job was the second offer (next to my part-time second job) that I got. My part-time second job, which could be made full-time, was a contracted role and had an end date contingent on staffing needs, and I was not overly eager to search for jobs again after being rejected and ghosted so many times. I guess I was also stubborn because I thought my Research Assistant role would be a foot in the door in terms of the trajectory I wanted to follow career-wise.

Once I actually moved to the city where my job was located, I was exhausted. My manager was going on leave soon, and left me a list of things to take care of while she was away. It seemed straightforward at the time, but when my manager was actually away, things were not as self-explanatory as they seemed. I did the best with the resources I had and actually pulled pretty late hours to keep up with everything. \[I feel this portion of the story needs to be fleshed out more, but I will do so in a future edit as people ask clarifying questions\]. I unfortunately did make another mistake.

When my manager came back from leave, all she could say was, the next time I made a mistake, she would have to document it. That was demoralizing to hear, and at this point, I was just so worn out. I didn't feel very supported during that summer while she was on leave, and it seemed that my efforts meant nothing. I lost my motivation and going to work was a chore. I wasn't as productive and I grew almost apathetic for a lack of better words.

**\[in the spirit of finishing up this story, the next few paragraphs are going to be a lot shorter and may be missing contextual details; I will edit and flesh out these paragraphs in the near future as questions arise and as I see fit\]**

A few months later, I missed a deadline. My manager was not happy, and said that as she noted before, if I made another mistake, she would have to document it, with this being my next mistake. I told her how I felt her evaluation over the summer was unfair (e.g. lack of support, resources, clarity, and how I did the best I could with the resources I had), and she agreed not to document it. I also had to work really long hours one day to try to get deliverables competed as close to the original deadline as possible. I was granted overtime, but this was flagged by my higher-level manager and a discussion was had with my manager about this. Since this was flagged by my higher-level manager, this issue was no longer just between my manager and I and was brought to the attention of my boss. Although no formal discussion was had between my boss and I, my underperformance had a further reach than just between my manager and I.

When it came time for my evaluation, I received a bad performance review. Shortly after, my manager told me that as I knew, my role was funded by a grant, and after reviewing the grants with my boss, that this particular grant that my job was funded by was ending in the new year and that my role would be removed. She was letting me know so that I could plan accordingly. Hearing this was a double whammy as far as bad news goes, right after the performance review, especially after that hard summer where I truly did the best I could. I just don't feel like a valued member on my team, and it really feels like my role ending has less to do with the grant ending and more to do with my performance. I never asked my manager if my role was being removed was truly due to the grant ending or due to my performance, partially because I'm not sure if I have the heart to hear it, and partially because I feel that a discussion at this point would be moot ***(let me know if you feel otherwise in the comments)*****.**

**\[In a future edit, for this paragraph, I want to speak more about my discomfort of speaking with my colleagues about what I'm going through, but for the sake of brevity, even though my story is anything but brief, I will omit it for now\]**

One part of my job that is uncomfortable for me is my boss (whether that is due to my own anxiety), or if my boss' personality brings about the same emotions and reactions in other people. She comes across to me as short-tempered. Even when I was doing a good job (the beginning months of my job), she was particular about how I behaved on Zoom meetings. When we were going over the survey I was working on, it must have looked to her that I wasn't taking notes, as she asked if I was taking notes while she was giving feedback on my survey, even though I was. When we first started the meeting, and she had issues with pulling up the survey, I thought reading the survey would be helpful to her, but she snapped at me and said ""Don't read it to me; I can read it myself,"" or something along the lines of that. I remember what she said almost verbatim as I remember how that meeting made me feel. She has gotten frustrated at me just for asking questions when I'm unclear on something. I feel I'm always walking on eggshells around my boss, and don't really feel empowered to bring something up to her, ask questions, or otherwise. 

I'm applying to jobs currently, but I feel so disheartened, and I'm incredibly fearful for the future. I also don't know if the next job will align with my career goals and or my interests, or if I'll find a job before the grant runs out, as I don't feel as confident as I was when I first started my job, and looking for a job when I was bright-eyed, bushy tailed, and eager was hard enough. I don't know if I'll be able to end up back in the area of public health that I'm interested in.

**If anyone has input on how I can move forward from this, and what my next steps are besides applying to jobs, it would be so, so, very much appreciated.** There are days when I just feel so alone in the world, when I just feel everything in my chest, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

Thank you so much for reading!",9,0,note this is a very rough draft so i hope you'll bear with me as you read through this i will edit and revise this as people ask clarifying questions in the comments section hi i'm a m currently working in public health as a research assistant for quite some time i've been feeling worn out stuck and am not sure where to move forward in my career i don't feel safe at work i e i don't feel that i can speak my mind and i don't know who i can trust or have anyone in the workplace that i trust with whom to confide in i was not always in the mental headspace that i was in and lately i've been reflecting and perplexed on how i got to where i am now what went wrong was it my personality was it my inability to let things go were my feelings not valid given the situation that i was in and did i inappropriately respond to said feelings was i just not thick skinned enough and if people have advice on how to be more thick skinned in the comments section please let me know was i just too immersed in my feelings and should have worked on separating my feelings from the rest of myself and just done my job when i first started my job i was not in the mental state that i am currently in i was bright eyed and bushy tailed eager and hungry for work when i was given my first project i put together a more or less functioning survey tool in two days the truth is i was probably pulling two hour days to get that done working a second job at night at the time i was very focused and motivated my predecessor at the time who was working with me for a brief moment before she transitioned to graduate school said that i did a good job especially given the circumstances working remotely during covid my manager had even come to me and communicated that my boss said that i was the right person for the job things were going pretty well at my job for the first five months or so i was sitting comfortably in meetings and felt as if i was treated as an equal or at the very least positively regarded by my colleagues then i made a mistake a big one at the day of project launch i asked my manager if she wanted to clear the test data in the survey tool before it was published she said yes but that was assuming that all the data in the tool was test data what i did not account for at the time was that people were already taking the survey so i could have inadvertently deleted real data it was a miscommunication and had i thought things through a little more or sought clarification i probably would not have moved ahead with the deletion of the data and just left it when i let my manager know she was not happy about that and was quite harsh about it we tried different ways to fix it but when we couldn't we went to our boss our boss was especially not happy about it and said that she didn't know what to say except that she was disappointed for the next two weeks or so my boss gave me the cold shoulder i felt ostracized by my team and no longer felt as though i were a member of my team of equal consideration it felt incredibly lonely i did apologize to my boss and she did accept my apology and said we could move on but it never really felt as though people moved on during that project period or perhaps i did not move on input regarding this would be much appreciated i think my manager was still frustrated with me at this time and while in the data collection phase she was making requests quite regularly in a given day i was feeling overwhelmed and was working longer than hour days and taking minute lunch breaks i did not feel comfortable telling her that i was feeling overwhelmed give the recent mistake so i just kept chugging along i'm not sure if my discomfort was valid or if it was due to my anxiety maybe it was a little bit of both as a result of me just feeling overwhelmed and just feeling the overall negative energy of my team towards me whether imagined or real is hard to tell possibly might have both i was making careless mistakes here and there which probably exacerbated my manager's frustration fast forward several months there came a time when a higher level manager came to me and asked if i had given any thought to moving to the city state where my job was located i was working remotely at the time and living with my parents given the pandemic i thought it was a casual inquiry but in fact our employer was requesting that all out of state employees move onsite due to state tax issues the manager said that she did want to be inflexible and asked what month would work for me to move onsite we established that moving by august was reasonable and to aim for that i went to my manager about this and talked more about moving dates after some discussion she said that it would be ideal if i could move by may or june i can't remember how the discussion led to this but i guess i was discussing a more firm deadline just so that i could plan accordingly august was a loose deadline when i discussed with the higher level manager i must be a terrible negotiator as my timeline for moving was suddenly moved to june which was just four months from our conversation when i tried to discuss this more with my manager and expressed concerns about financial issues she got frustrated and said that there has been a lot of back and forth with my salary with asking questions about tasks and now with this moving issue and that it was not a productive use of time she said that my financial concerns were a nonissue as i knew what the salary was when i took the job and flipped out i just stopped talking about it after that however the financial issues were not the only issue on my plate my dad had recently lost his job during covid and my mother was supporting the two of them between her salary which is not much more than mine think a little over hour and my father's unemployment moving at the time was a great financial and emotional strain for both me and my parents also when i resigned myself to moving i soon found out that it was not easy to find housing for june in february or june in general the city my job is located in revolves around the academic cycle so most apartments are available when the school semester starts i was also still working two jobs at the time so i was essentially working from am sometimes earlier to pm at my research assistant job and working from pm at my second job sometimes my second job would run late so i would sometimes be working till pm afterwards i'd be staying up till am am browsing through craigslist and facebook for

depression,d3645a,"Does anyone else feel 100x worse after going to see a GP/or talk to a ""mental health professional""?","I've started seeing a CBT therapist on Tuesday and she seems really nice, I'm optimistic about getting help and working through my problems. I'm not complaining about her/proper therapy. She is clearly qualified and she words her questions properly.

What I have an issue with is my GP, who clearly knows fuck all about mental health problems. They dryly ask me ""are you making plans to kill yourself?"". I'll ask them what I should do and they throw is back like ""I don't know what can we do for you?"". They'll scroll through a long list of antidepressants and ask me which ones I want to try, like I'm a kid picking out sweets at a corner shop. And I can never see the same doctor, so every time I go I have to explain my whole situation again. 

And I have problems, when I get in contact with my city's mental health clinic, and I have a 40 minute phone call/questionnaire that tells me nothing I don't already know. 

""On a scale of 1-10 how often have you felt bad about yourself, like you're a failure"".  

""Oh well our questionnaire tells me you're experiencing high levels of depression and high levels of anxiety"" 

Holy shit no way I never knew. Its almost like the reason I applied for therapy through you is because I already know I'm really depressed and anxious. Then the woman is telling me if I do want to kill myself/if I have an attempt that I should go to A&E/the ER. Like wow, no shit.

""Yeah I see leaving the house and going to group events and situations is difficult for you"" (5 minutes later) ""I'll email you the details about our group therapy sessions"". 

I just can't deal with how ingenuine these services are. They just don't want me to become another suicide statistic, that is it. 

And they treat you and talk to you like you're stupid, or they'll try and act like they know you. I tell the woman on the phone I'm wanting to find a part time job to help with my self esteem etc., like literally anything like retail or serving tables, and she says ""ohhh yeah I can tell you'd be really good at that"". Like is that sorry attempt to boost my confidence, when you've known me for all of 20 minutes, meant to make me feel better? Christ. 

Oh and I've struggled for fucking weeks getting an appointment with my GP about my mental health. They've cancelled my appointments, and it seems like whenever I call they have no space. I say I've been having suicidal thoughts to the mental health clinic (not intentions) and they call my GP immediately. My GP call me up immediately, and offer an appointment ASAP. Fucking ridiculous.

So that's my rant done.

depression,vqupcg,"Bad mental health to begin with, and not sure what to do. Watching someone I used to love struggle… even if he says he’s fine.","Idk where to begin really… I don’t feel like typing much. Been trying to keep happy at least in front of people and online. But I’m just fucking hurt and sad…. I’m sick of life. I hate everything.

I already have a super fucked up mental state due to trauma as a baby/toddler and growing up (every type of abuse starting around age 6). Going through that shit really messed up how my brain formed and it’s frustrating because I do shit I don’t WANT to do, and I don’t know why I do them. I have BPD on top of it and psychosis at times. It scares me how bad I can get… I don’t want to keep living like this. I constantly have to watch everything I say or do and walk on eggshells to make sure I stay “in line” and be the perfect person. No fucking up… 

Going through pregnancy on top of it… which literally makes me even more psychotic because of all the hormones being pumped into my system I can’t control. On top of it, the dad is one of two people but I’m only like 90% sure it’s one person (my ex), because the other guy had a vasectomy but idk if he’s still sterile or not because he has never gone to regular checkups. So waiting on that to rule him out. So there’s that anxiety… I’m miserable either way with who’s kid it is. But that’s a different story. 

My ex I’m fucking pissed at for some of the shit he’s done recently, since hearing he got me pregnant, and at the same time I still have a soft spot for him I’m trying to ignore but really I’m just fucking hurt… I’m hurt by everyone. 

Other dude I still am in contact with and I really really like him but he really doesn’t like me, maybe even hates me for some of the psychotic shit I’ve done to him, and that’s completely reasonable and fair but it hurts because I have no idea why I acted that way or what was going on in my head so I just wake up every day fucking pissed at myself and hating myself and hurt by myself for being me. I try so hard to be “good” and I always always always fuck up and hurt the people I care about big time. Not like some small shit either. Like totally fucked. We fight constantly. Not sure why we even stay “friends”. We aren’t friends but idk the right word. I guess it’s sorta forced because of our situation… we have to see each other frequently. But anyways… I used to love him and be in love with him and would have done anything for him but after he hurt me so many times over and over… as a reaction of him being hurt by his ex… idk. I still care. I don’t wanna walk away. I don’t want to give up. There’s this tiny part of me who still wants to be with him. Like dating. I feel it every so often. And it’s mostly just pain. We used to have fun. We used to be better. Now the hurt from each other and our exes and depression has just made everything muddy and grey. Neither of us can be happy. He says he’s fine but I can see it in his face and posture that he misses her and misses the good times when he was happy with her. I know because I have the same feelings to my ex. It’s like looking in a mirror. And there’s nothing I can do. No way I can help. It’s soul crushing. I’d rather him be happy than me. I’d do anything- even lose all my belongings and be homeless- just for him to have a chance at happiness. Because behind all the hurt… I still really care about him. If I could ever have a second chance… to do shit over… I’d want to try and take away the pain his ex caused. He says I’m kinda like her but idk. I don’t know her. I don’t want to replace her. I’m not her. I’m me. I want to share his pain and help us both heal. 

Idk I’m just ranting at this point. I’m crying at the table rn typing all this, and I can feel my chest is heavy with depression and hurt and I just want it to get better. I feel like it never will. But also I can’t move on from him. I wish I could. But nobody is like him. Even the men I’ve met who are literal professors and rich scientists who are into me too… idk it’s just not the same. And one has the same car, nice house, all the stuff he does, and I just… I can’t. 

He always said I only liked him for his stuff. But I know that’s not true. Especially when people are willing to buy me shit like fancy cars and shovel out money for me to treat me… it’s just not the same. I don’t want the stuff. I want him. Homeless or a millionaire. It wouldn’t matter to me. 

I wish I could help with his pain… maybe it would help with mine. 

I still want him. 

I’d do anything to be his. I just don’t say it… because I feel psychotic when I do. Like why?? He will never love me. He doesn’t find me attractive either I don’t think like physically…. So why am I wanting the one man on earth I can’t get?? It’s just causing me more pain. I don’t know what to do. I’m sick of hurting. 

I used to have a super high sex drive and now there’s nothing. Nothing at all. I still find him physically attractive. Just too depressed for that spark to happen unless he starts something. 

He kissed me twice the other day and I almost cried with joy. Unprompted.

depression,vfwk2j,My job is killing me! It's destroying my mental health! How can I make it stop?!!,"I've been working as a banker for the last 17 years.  The only reason why I work in this field is because job opportunities are very limited over here and banking is where the money is at.  I hate it!  It's destroying my life.  I have to drag myself out of bed every single day to go to work.  Sometimes, I get anxiety attacks as soon as I wake up and start throwing up because I'm too scared to go to work. I hate what I do and it doesn't suit my personality. The level of stress that we have to go through everyday is ridiculous.  Every time I tried to change fields it didn't work.  eventually, I gave up and had to accept the fact that this is my career and it's too late to change it now.  I'm stuck in this horrible job until retirement.  Some of you might think that I'm exaggerating when I say it's difficult to switch jobs or get a new job in general over here but trust me it's that bad.  Even with my qualifications.  Today, My mental health has reached breaking point and I'm mentally and physically exhausted.  4 years ago, we had a management change in the bank and it all went down hell from there.  The new boss, because of one stupid little incident turned on me when it wasn't even my fault.  He has made my life hell and we've become very resentful of each other.  He also made a lot of changes in the bank which has made the place very toxic.  All you hear is complaints from other employees on daily basis.  Everyone hates it. Since then, It's been hell and my mental health has been deteriorating big time. I feel like I'm trapped.  I've been suffering from Depression, Severe anxiety disorder, and PTSD for years but it has escalated to peak levels for the last 4 years.  I'm on medication and I see a psychiatrist on weekly basis but every time I make a little bit of progress, something triggers me at work and I go back to square one.  It has reached the point where seeing a psychiatrist and being on medication has become so pointless because stuff at work will keep triggering me and destroy whatever progress I've been making.  Unfortunately, I cant afford to resign because I have a loan and I need the fixed income.   I'm also about 4 years away from retirement so I don't want to lose my pension after all these years of working.  I'm currently doing what you call 'Quiet quitting"" but it's actually stressing me out because I'm on edge all the time thinking that ill get a call from management warning me about my performance.  I've mentally checked out. I cant function anymore and their demands are getting too unrealistic which has made me give up as well.  The target set by management is ridiculous.  Lately, because of all this pressure, I've been snapping at everyone at work and my anger is getting extreme.  I'm afraid that I'm going to lose control soon and do something stupid.  I cant tolerate anything anymore and I'm running out of patience.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I haven't even left my room in 2 weeks except for work.  I'm isolating myself more and more everyday and what hurts the most is I'm making my family suffer as well.  I really need help.  I've hit rock bottom and don't know how to get out of this hell.  I feel like I'm stuck forever.  I'm tired of living in fear every single day and I don't think I can handle this pain and torture anymore.  My life outside work isn't that great as well.  Half of my friends abandoned me because of my depression and the other half are busy with family and stuff.  I hardly go out.

depression,wzcqjr,My family doesn’t take my mental health seriously,"Hey there, first time poster just needing to vent. I’m 26, a stay at home mom to a beautiful almost two-year-old daughter, and I’m in a wonderful relationship. However, I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety. And in turn, I’ve been drinking a lot over the past couple years (minus while pregnant).

A month ago, I bit the bullet to start therapy after my cousin referred me to her therapist. I realized my drinking was out of control, my anxiety was at an all time high, and I just had no motivation to do anything. Therapy has been really helpful in all aspects of my life, and I really feel hopeful now.

Yesterday, my mom (she’s technically my aunt—my mom died when I was young) daughter and I took a road trip. For reference, my mom has never taken my mental health seriously. I was explaining about how my sister in law was depressed and how to go about nudging her toward therapy. My mom mentioned “sounds like she needs it more than you” and proceeded to tell me that I only started therapy because my cousin did first.

Which is absolutely not true. I did it to help my relationships and to be a better mom. To become the best version of me so that my daughter can do the same as she grows up. It’s frustrating, because apparently I shouldn’t have struggles because I don’t work and have an amazing kid? That’s not how depression works.

It really hurt my feelings but it’s nothing new. My mom always felt bad for other people who were depressed but not me, even when I was a kid.

depression,wnfq0k,Thinking of buying a cheap house in a bad neighborhood in Philly for my mental health as much as my financial security.,"Disclaimer: I DO NOT Reccomend this for anyone.  I'm only speaking from my experience and what I think will work for me based on my life experiences.    


8 Years ago I got clean off Heroin and the first 2 years of my sobriety I spent it in Camden NJ.  When I first got there, as someone who grew up in affluent suburbs, I was nervous about living in (at the time the murder capital of the US).  As time went on, I grew to love it, and it was possibly the best 2 years of my life.  I was FORCED to socialize with people because you don't really have a choice when you live in a densly populated neighborhood like that.  There were tons of neighborhood improvement activities that were super easy to get sucked into.  Things like getting together with the other residents and cleaning the park up of all the used needles, trash, and whatever other blight you find in a place like that.  It was a place where I didn't feel judged.  It was a place where talking to others was easier than anywhere else.  There was no ""keeping appearances"" or ""trying to impress"" anyone.  You're literally in the ghetto picking up drug paraphernalia and trash.  It made me feel good and it made me feel like I was a part of something, and people in the area greatly appreciated the simple effort.   


When my life came together, I moved to the suburbs of New Jersey and it didn't take long for me to isolate and become absolutely miserable.  I went on like that for years.  Thoughts of jumping off a bridge started flooding my mind.  I constantly isolated and fell deeper into my own self misery, until by chance things went south with a roommate, and the fastest cheapest place to go was in a, not terrible, but deteriorating neighborhood in Philly.  I moved there on a whim to save money.  That neighborhood was trashy, run down, and really struggling and I only picked it because it was cheap and close to work.  Well, fast forward a few months and I started making friends with the neighbors.  I started getting sucked into neighborhood improvement efforts.  Going across the street to pick up beer bottles, needles, and trash.  Helping people a couple row homes down sweep the leaves off their front stoop.  I again, felt some kind of purpose.    


A little over a year ago, I moved to a south central PA county for work.  The idea was ""I'm leaving this crappy neighborhood for a better quality of life for the same lower cost"".  A year in and I'm fucking miserable.  There is nothing to do.  I'm afraid to go outside.  I'm afraid to go ""find something to get involved in"" and showing up for those scheduled commitments, like volunteering at a shelter in the small nearby city, or really doing anything.  Anything that involves me getting in my car and driving to.  The crippling fear of just getting in the car and GOING SOMEWHERE to meet people.  I can't bring myself to do it.  I go to a local AA meeting and I do a shit job of socializing with the people around here.  It feels like, with the anxiety, my health is deteriorating, and I just feel like I am absolutely nothing.  I feel like I have no purpose.  I feel like my life is completely meaningless.  My doctor tried to prescribe me an SSRI and I refuse to take a goddamned pill that may or may not make me feel some sort of sense of meaning.    


I've made the decision that when my lease is up in June, I'm going to buy a cheap rowhome in Philadelphia.  I don't know why, but I just seem to do better in the city.  It's easy to get sucked into community activities.  Even when the topics of discussion are depressing or hopeless, it's a topic of discussion with a common goal that I can relate to those around me.  I know it's not inherently safe, but I do know and understand certain rules and precautions for staying safe in an environment like that.

So during 2009 my grandmother passed away in her sleep from cancer then a year later in 2010 my dad died in his sleep from a heart attack but at the time it felt like weeks apart about 2 weeks to be exact, but ever since then I can’t recall what they looked like or what I did with my time from 2010 to now and everything from then is fragmented in terms of memory’s but I am finding myself staying up till I pass out as I am terrified to go to sleep in case I die and I have periods of depression every 2 months and intensified anxiety around sleep during these times, and I get scared when my children are asleep or even my wife it causes me a great deal of stress but I feel it could be stupid and I should continue to bottle up my depression and feelings and I feel I was told to do this when my dad died.

 last year in 2020 my mother died in her sleep from unknown causes and this had caused me to sleep even less than before and my mood is getting worse and worse and I’m struggling to cope.

I feel like my lack of sleep is killing me, I stay awake by any means possible, I feel like I’m loosing sanity but if I sleep I could die and I can’t take that risk I’m terrified

depression,2u2de1,Popular girl posts about her mental health and I can't help but feel angry about it.,"I know this is so stupid, so bad. But I feel like maybe here is a safe space to just let it out since depression and anxiety aren't really reasonable feelings in the first place.

This girl I knew growing up posted a blog post about her mental health. She describes her anxiety and depression related to being stressed at her school. She has great education, she's a photographer and wants to work for big names. I feel like she is strong for talking about it, I mean it can be hard, but how hard can it be for someone with a thousands of friends, where everyone will post 50 nice messages to her?

It made me feel so crap. I guess I am feeling jealous. Sad that I will never have people but my family care about me. That I'm worth less because I don't have what she has, I was isolated when I was a teen so I am not strong enough to socialise for hours a day.

It just sucks knowing that all of us who, don't have tons of friends and great education, etc, nobody will care about. If I killed myself, nobody would write nice messages to me, nobody would really care much.

depression,vmfztg,Parents separation taking a toll on my mental health,"Weird but not horrible parental situation

My parents (m51) and (f50) have been married since they were 18. They had three children (f26), (f24) and me (m18). My second sister (f24) found out in 2019 that my mom was dating some guy and at first she thought my mom was cheating on my dad. 

However it turns out they had been separated and my dad is ok with my mom seeing other people. We kids had an idea that they were separated as my mom would spend a large amount of time in the US while my dad lives in MRU. I basically saw her 4 months a year because I was going to school in MRU. My dad is the sole provider and has made a comfortable amount for our family. 

Since my sister discovered about this third person, this forced my mom to tell the children about the separation and the promise of divorce from my dad. However she told us we weren’t allowed to disclose the fact that we know about any of this to my dad. “Why don’t you just come clean and tell your dad that you know?” Well because we are worried that he might not carry out the promises he has made to my mom through the divorce if he finds out she went behind his back to tell us (the children) about the situation. I have no doubt that my dad wouldn’t go back on his word and that he will carry out whatever promise he has made but my mom doesn’t not trust him. 

Every time I talk to my dad I feel like shit. Him and I have a very close connection because he raised me during my high school life until boarding. He raised me from 13-17 years of age. Those were the most important years of my life and I will forever be grateful at how he has committed to raising me alone. Thus this trust we have developed feels like a burden as now I feel like I’m betraying him by not telling him that I know about my moms lover and about the whole divorce. The worst is during boarding school he would tell me how he felt lonely and sad when he came home to an empty house. That’s what kills me the most, knowing that my mom is living her life while he is suffering and I can’t even tell him to move on and start dating. 

I was processing and moving on with my life until tonight he told me that he was going to try to convince her to come to a family vacation so we could all be together again for the first time since pre Covid. I don’t know how to tell him no. 

This situation has caused a lot of anxiety problems as well as depression. I feel like I need to runaway, yell and just let out all frustration but I don’t know how nor do I know how to resolve anything. I have been talking to a counselor but I can’t reach out to them right now because I’m staying with my mom and I’m worried she’ll over hear.

Sometimes I feel the easiest thing to do is let go, I mean it’s so easy to take your own life nowadays especially with these fucked up gun laws in the US. I am staying strong and finding a way to eventually get out of bed.

I've told her about my mental health countless times, but she refuses to help. She refuses to listen and believes it's an excuse. My anxiety doesn't allow me to get help from an outside source, so when my parents won't do shit, what am I supposed to do?

Then there's technology, and it goes back to being old fashioned parents from the south. They blame EVERYTHING I do wrong on it. Oh, your eyesight is bad because you've been staring at a screen. Oh, your grades are bad because of video games.

depression,oh37t1,I'm struggling with my mental health and don't know what to do,"Trigger warning anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts

I have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life. But a few months ago I did a 6 week group therapy course and I was feeling much better. I started slimming world, I started going to the gym, I just started enjoying life again. 

I have to have hormone injections every month to put me through menopause at age 29 and soon I will be having surgery to remove my final ovary because of endometriosis. The last 4 weeks or so I have felt absolutely amazing, I've had a positive outlook on life, I've been going out and doing things and actually having a life. Then I realized last week that I had missed my previous hormone injection, I don't know how long for. So last week I went to the doctors and had it done, and since then the darkness has been rolling in and slowly suffocating me. And now I'm terrified that when I have my surgery I will be in this dark place constantly because I will be menopausal and because of my health issues I can't take HRT. 

I have pain in my chest, I'm constantly fighting panic attacks, I'm not bathing or even changing my clothes some days. I'm trying to eat right so that I can hold on to something that has made me happy but the urge to binge eat is constant. I am fighting it but it's just so hard.

I have to walk my dog once a day and I'm sat here paralyzed by anxiety, not wanting to leave the house. Like there's something pinning me in place. I want to cry all the time, I'm picking fights with my husband over trivial things. I just feel like I'm drowning.

I want to speak to my doctor about changing my medications but I'm too scared to pick up the phone. Plus even if I could I sleep 12 hours a night and I often miss the chance to even make an appointment.

I've been suicidal in the past when the darkness takes over and I'm not there yet but I'm terrified it's just around the corner.

ETA today I sat with my medication bottle and a voice in my head was telling me to drink the whole bottle. Thankfully my thoughts turned to my husband who is sick in bed and I knew he would never forgive himself if I did something like that when he couldn't help me. I'm scared of myself. Walking the dog felt like I was claustrophobic even though I was outside.

Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

Anxiety,1mfkwi2,Can anyone help me figure out what’s going on with my health?,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been struggling with multiple health issues over the past 3 years, and I feel like everything is piling on top of each other. I really need some insight or shared experiences.
	
•	It started with GERD, gastritis, and reflux about 3 years ago. That really affected my lifestyle — for over a year I was mostly depressed, staying home, lying or sitting all day and just looking at my phone.
In 2024, things got worse — I started vomiting a lot from stress and ended up losing 8 kg. I did manage to regain the weight, but this year my body still doesn’t feel quite right.
	
•	In October 2024, I was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis — my anti-TPO and anti-TG antibodies were elevated, and my FT3 was in the normal range but on the higher end. At that time, my ferritin was 27, which was in the lower end of the normal range.
	
•	In January of this year, I developed constant daily headaches and tinnitus, and sometimes I get episodes of a racing heartbeat.
	
•	Later on, I thought maybe my headaches were related to my vision, so I got my eyes checked — turns out I needed glasses: -0.5 in the left eye and -0.75 in the right.
	
•	In May, I checked my ferritin again and it had dropped to only 8. Around that same time, my neck became so tense I couldn’t move it for a few days, and I could hear pulsing in it for almost two weeks.
Unfortunately, I can’t tolerate iron pills due to my gastritis, so my ferritin has likely stayed very low for months now.

I feel like something deeper is going on or that all of these symptoms might be connected.
Could low ferritin be causing the headaches and tinnitus? Is it long-term stress, chronic inflammation, nutrient issues, or even posture? I’ve spent so much time slouched or lying down, and lately my neck feels like it’s carrying a weight, and my head feels tight or heavy most days.

Also, I tend to spiral mentally and overthink, and I’ve noticed that even just thinking or worrying about something can trigger or worsen my physical symptoms — especially the headaches and neck tension. I don’t know if this is making everything worse or part of what’s going on. I’d really appreciate any advice, ideas, or personal experiences. I feel stuck and overwhelmed.

Anxiety,1ndz5lq,Mental health resources for an autistic adult?,"
Hello. I am wondering if anyone knows of any mental health resources specifically for people with autism? 

Long story short, I was receiving services paid for by vocational rehab in my state from the organization called AANE (the specific program was called LifeMap Coaching). Unfortunately, vocational rehab cut this service due to budget cuts in my state. I was told by my states disability services department that they cannot fund the service for me as they have a grant that says it’s for autism ONLY individuals, and unfortunately I have autism and an intellectual disability. Because I lost this service, I am feeling very lost and uncertain how to move forward, and it is definitely impacting my mental health. I am in therapy, but I only see my therapist once a week. I am also on medication but I don’t know if it helps enough. So honestly I’m just struggling a lot and it is impacting my anxiety a great deal. Some days, I honestly felt the life coaching was helping me even more than therapy! Basically, I met with the coach once a week and we would work on different goals and skills related to my autism and to help me become more independent. And now I don’t have access to it at all! This really sucks to say the least! 

If I am being honest, losing coaching feels very “unfair”. (Well, that’s probably not the best word to describe it, but it’s the word I can come up with in this moment.)
When I had coaching, I was learning coping skills for being a recently diagnosed autistic adult, and now that I no longer have coaching, I suppose I don’t know how to cope in this world, especially since it seems that this world is not made for people who are neurodivergent. It just plain stinks. That’s all I can say.

Furthermore, I can’t be the only person receiving disability services in my state that has both Autism and an intellectual disability. I am sure that there are other angry/upset families out there being impacted by this. 

Anyhow, I just feel really lost (and kind of depressed/anxious if I am being honest) without the support that life coaching with AANE provided, and I am trying to explore every possible avenue I can to get it back, as not having this service is taking a toll on my mental health unfortunately, and I am unsure how to move forward…

The BEST way I can describe it, is that when I was working with the life coach, I actually felt like I may be able to accomplish something in my life, and I grew to love our sessions together. Now that I no longer have coaching sessions with the life coach, I just feel that I am floundering in life, and I am not sure how I can learn to be successful, especially as an adult living with autism. I also feel that if I was diagnosed with autism as a young child, I wouldn’t be having these issues that I am experiencing since I was diagnosed with autism only last year. And I feel that me being successful has been “ripped away from me” in some ways. I just don’t know what to do. I suppose therapy does help somewhat, but it’s kind of complicated because it’s not geared at people with Autism, even though my therapist is on the spectrum. I have more deep feelings on this too, but it’s hard for me to put into words since I am so upset. 

I can’t stress enough how much life coaching really helped me out, and I don’t know what to do now that I lost this service. (If I am being honest, I have felt more anxious since losing the service, and I am unsure what to do.) 

Furthermore, I hope that my disabilities (especially autism) don’t prevent me from living a “normal” life. Other than employment and learning to live on my own, one major goal I want to see for my life is being able to get married and have a family (sometime in the next 10 years or so). If Autism or any of my other disabilities were to make that impossible for my life, I think I would be absolutely heartbroken and devastated (and probably resentful too). So I really hope that’s not the case.

I will try and hang in there, but if I am being honest it is very hard, and I am unsure how to best move forward with this situation…I wish I had more answers. ",1,0,hello i am wondering if anyone knows of any mental health resources specifically for people with autism long story short i was receiving services paid for by vocational rehab in my state from the organization called aane the specific program was called lifemap coaching unfortunately vocational rehab cut this service due to budget cuts in my state i was told by my states disability services department that they cannot fund the service for me as they have a grant that says it s for autism only individuals and unfortunately i have autism and an intellectual disability because i lost this service i am feeling very lost and uncertain how to move forward and it is definitely impacting my mental health i am in therapy but i only see my therapist once a week i am also on medication but i don t know if it helps enough so honestly i m just struggling a lot and it is impacting my anxiety a great deal some days i honestly felt the life coaching was helping me even more than therapy basically i met with the coach once a week and we would work on different goals and skills related to my autism and to help me become more independent and now i don t have access to it at all this really sucks to say the least if i am being honest losing coaching feels very unfair well that s probably not the best word to describe it but it s the word i can come up with in this moment when i had coaching i was learning coping skills for being a recently diagnosed autistic adult and now that i no longer have coaching i suppose i don t know how to cope in this world especially since it seems that this world is not made for people who are neurodivergent it just plain stinks that s all i can say furthermore i can t be the only person receiving disability services in my state that has both autism and an intellectual disability i am sure that there are other angry upset families out there being impacted by this anyhow i just feel really lost and kind of depressed anxious if i am being honest without the support that life coaching with aane provided and i am trying to explore every possible avenue i can to get it back as not having this service is taking a toll on my mental health unfortunately and i am unsure how to move forward the best way i can describe it is that when i was working with the life coach i actually felt like i may be able to accomplish something in my life and i grew to love our sessions together now that i no longer have coaching sessions with the life coach i just feel that i am floundering in life and i am not sure how i can learn to be successful especially as an adult living with autism i also feel that if i was diagnosed with autism as a young child i wouldn t be having these issues that i am experiencing since i was diagnosed with autism only last year and i feel that me being successful has been ripped away from me in some ways i just don t know what to do i suppose therapy does help somewhat but it s kind of complicated because it s not geared at people with autism even though my therapist is on the spectrum i have more deep feelings on this too but it s hard for me to put into words since i am so upset i can t stress enough how much life coaching really helped me out and i don t know what to do now that i lost this service if i am being honest i have felt more anxious since losing the service and i am unsure what to do furthermore i hope that my disabilities especially autism don t prevent me from living a normal life other than employment and learning to live on my own one major goal i want to see for my life is being able to get married and have a family sometime in the next years or so if autism or any of my other disabilities were to make that impossible for my life i think i would be absolutely heartbroken and devastated and probably resentful too so i really hope that s not the case i will try and hang in there but if i am being honest it is very hard and i am unsure how to best move forward with this situation i wish i had more answers,0.13252416188462698,-0.8547,NEGATIVE,0.9988716244697571,positive,negative,negative

Anxiety,kqdaki,Do whatever you need to protect your mental health,"Trigger warning: Suicidal thoughts

So I had been planning from moving from Arizona to LA for over a year. I knew I would be scared shitless when I got there, but I was forcing myself to do what was scary. Looking back, I don't know why I thought it was the place for me. I have really bad anxiety being away from family, driving in new places, finding parking, and just generally being uprooted. Also - and this will come into play later - I have a massive, phobia-level fear of cockroaches.

So the time came last week to move. I had all my stuff packed, and both of my parents took the weekend off to help me. They had devoted time and money to help me make this move, and both later told me they knew the whole time it was the wrong choice for me but they wanted me to learn on my own. 

Leading up to this, I was having extreme anxiety and depression about moving. I felt ""buyer's remorse"" and was dissociating a lot to remove myself from my impending new reality.

When I get there, shit hits the fan. The apartment doesn't look ready, shit is dirty or unfinished, the new roommate is filthy and up until this point had been manipulating me to pick this specific apartment even though I read reviews about roach infestations, and I hear screaming fights in the middle of the night about drugs downstairs.

Then the roaches. Over the course of two days my mom finds and kills upwards of 60 roaches. On the kitchen counter, in the fridge, on the walls and ceiling, and in my room. The night before my parents are supposed to leave, I get overwhelmed with such intense suicidal thoughts I have the worst panic attack of my life - shivering, hyperventilating, crying, etc. Moving felt like too much, but with my phobia and the roach infestation there was no fucking way I was staying there. Both my parents said hell no and packed my stuff back into the van and we left.

TLDR is basically do what you need for your mental health, no matter how much of a worldly inconvenience it is for everyone else.

Anxiety,1m6kiju,how can I help a friend going through mental health struggles when I also have... mental health struggles?,"I've struggled with this a long time, but now that I'm working on setting boundaries, I'm not sure how to set this particular one. I have GAD and therefore have anxiety to deal with on my own. And, of course, a lot of my close friends have anxiety and depression and other issues, so we all try to help each other when we can. The problem is that dealing with other people's mental health issues takes a toll on me. And it's not something I'd ever admit to them, because I don't want them to feel worse than they already do. I do think there is a specific trigger, going back to a very toxic friendship that I had in high school, so I'm trying to work my way around that and figure out how to be there for people. 

A good example is a friend that I have currently who is truly one of the best and most wonderful people I know. But, she suffers from anxiety and depression, and often has very bad days, which can require help to get her through it. And I do want to be there for her, of course I do. But something about it starts to trigger my anxiety and though I always do stick around for as long as I need to when she needs me, I start to feel anxious about ""what if I can't help her"" or ""what if she needs me while I'm not around"" and things like that. I'm starting to feel it wear on my own mental health (which already has issues that are just my GAD problems).

Anxiety,1jd8eo2,When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

Anxiety,1l5xjpl,My boyfriend struggles with several mental health issues (explained below). How can I best support him? Desperately need advice from people that are going through similar situations.,"Hey everyone,

I just want to start by saying this is coming from a really loving and hopeful place. My boyfriend means the world to me, and I want to be the best support I can for him while he’s going through some tough mental health challenges.

He’s been diagnosed with depression, psychosis, OCD, and spasticity. He spent about two months in a mental health clinic recently and is waiting to start therapy next month. Right now, we’re long distance, so I can’t be physically there to hold him or support him in person, which makes me feel a bit helpless sometimes.

He struggles a lot with anxiety, paranoia, and these really scary irrational fears that affect him daily. I want to learn how to be there for him in a way that helps, and I want to know how to support him with kindness and patience, without overwhelming him.

What I have been doing so far has been listening to him and check on him often. Whenever he has irrational fears, I take my time to explain why they’re not real and help calm him down. I try to distract him, make him happy, and make him laugh. I also encourage him to learn and research about his symptoms and diagnosis on his own, as well as watching videos about it together (suggestions are appreciated).

If you’ve gone through something similar or are in a relationship with someone dealing with these issues, I’d love to hear what worked for you. How did you or your partner cope? What should I be mindful of? What helped you feel loved and safe?

Anxiety,1jfd5ro,I cannot sleep or relax due to extreme death and health anxiety and feel very mentally unsafe.,"I couldn't find my other post so I am making a new one, sorry if there's two different posts.

On two recent occasions I have been to the ER for panic attacks. First time, I woke up abruptly from sleep, had a rapid heart rate, bloating, felt like I was going to poop (and die from it), and wasn't sure if I was going to die or have a heart attack. I had an elevated d-dimer which prompted a chest CT scan but that revealed nothing. EKG came back with tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not seem concerned). TSH was 50 (I was previously on levothyroxine but stopped, I started taking it again after the ER visit). I was discharged with anxiety. The week after this was quite possibly the hardest week of my life, I felt so drained, developed insomnia, depression, bad depersonalization, and of course, more panic attacks.

The sheer visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like I am dying had forced me to confront my extreme fear of death. I started seeing a therapist and recovered a bit from this event, but panic attacks, especially nocturnal ones, continued.

Fast forward to last week, I had another experience of a wave of extreme panic, sense of doom, rapid heart rate. I identified it as a panic attack, worked through those feelings, but I couldn't quite shake this sense that something was just...off. The next day I woke up and felt weird, but I tried to shrug it off. I couldn't. I went to the ER with a calm head, citing chest pain, dizziness, and sense of doom. EKG came back with possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not say anything about this) and the nurse said there were muscle tremors on the EKG (whatever that means). They ran blood tests but said everything looked good.

Chopping it up to anxiety, I was medically discharged but spoke with a therapist who referred me to inpatient care for mental health. I shared with her my feelings of feeling like I was going to die, or that something was very wrong. She seemed convinced that it could just be my mental health which felt reassuring. I agreed to inpatient, however, when they placed me in a room with no windows or anything, all white like a psych ward and took away all my belongings and neglected my care (I had to wait several hours for a dinner after not eating all day), I decided I wouldn't feel so safe doing something like that, so I opted to go home.

Since then, I cannot sleep, I cannot shake this sense of doom. I cannot go to bed without the fear of losing consciousness or dying. I haven't slept well in days, and it has made the already existing depression so much worse. I am so sad, I have been crying every day, sobbing uncontrollably at times with the fear that something bad is going to happen to me. I feel like any time I close my eyes, I am dying. I'm afraid I will die of a heart attack, or a brain anuerysym, or have a tumor that is causing my panic attacks.

I am struggling with consistent intrusive thoughts telling me that I am going to die, that this is it for me, that I will die soon, or that death is on the horizon. I have visions of my dead body on the floor. I am doing my best to fight them but it's been very, very hard. I love life and I don't want to die, but this experience has really shook me. I feel like I am going mentally insane and cannot control my anxiety no matter how hard I try. What started as panic attacks now feels like a full blown preoccupation with my own death that is preventing me from feeling well. I feel like I have the flu and physically cannot relax.

I scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor who prescribed meds for bloating and an anti histamine for sleep and anxiety but I am SO fearful I will have a severe allergic reaction or that it will make me feel worse that I cannot take them.

Could there be something medical causing this extreme discomfort and sense of doom? I feel so heavy and full of grief for so many things right now. The weight of the world is on my chest. It seems like every sensation in my body is causing me to panic. I'm having sharp pains everywhere, back pain, bloating, headaches, jaw pain, sinus pain. I have always struggled health wise -- I have hypothyroidism, migraines, stomach issues, extremely bad periods, and I am always dismissed by doctors as just having anxiety, but I am so fed up with genuinely feeling bad in my body that my soul feels tired. Is this just anxiety? Does anyone have any coping strategies or recommendations on moving forward?",2,7,i couldn't find my other post so i am making a new one sorry if there's two different posts on two recent occasions i have been to the er for panic attacks first time i woke up abruptly from sleep had a rapid heart rate bloating felt like i was going to poop and die from it and wasn't sure if i was going to die or have a heart attack i had an elevated d dimer which prompted a chest ct scan but that revealed nothing ekg came back with tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement doctor did not seem concerned tsh was i was previously on levothyroxine but stopped i started taking it again after the er visit i was discharged with anxiety the week after this was quite possibly the hardest week of my life i felt so drained developed insomnia depression bad depersonalization and of course more panic attacks the sheer visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like i am dying had forced me to confront my extreme fear of death i started seeing a therapist and recovered a bit from this event but panic attacks especially nocturnal ones continued fast forward to last week i had another experience of a wave of extreme panic sense of doom rapid heart rate i identified it as a panic attack worked through those feelings but i couldn't quite shake this sense that something was just off the next day i woke up and felt weird but i tried to shrug it off i couldn't i went to the er with a calm head citing chest pain dizziness and sense of doom ekg came back with possible left atrial enlargement doctor did not say anything about this and the nurse said there were muscle tremors on the ekg whatever that means they ran blood tests but said everything looked good chopping it up to anxiety i was medically discharged but spoke with a therapist who referred me to inpatient care for mental health i shared with her my feelings of feeling like i was going to die or that something was very wrong she seemed convinced that it could just be my mental health which felt reassuring i agreed to inpatient however when they placed me in a room with no windows or anything all white like a psych ward and took away all my belongings and neglected my care i had to wait several hours for a dinner after not eating all day i decided i wouldn't feel so safe doing something like that so i opted to go home since then i cannot sleep i cannot shake this sense of doom i cannot go to bed without the fear of losing consciousness or dying i haven't slept well in days and it has made the already existing depression so much worse i am so sad i have been crying every day sobbing uncontrollably at times with the fear that something bad is going to happen to me i feel like any time i close my eyes i am dying i'm afraid i will die of a heart attack or a brain anuerysym or have a tumor that is causing my panic attacks i am struggling with consistent intrusive thoughts telling me that i am going to die that this is it for me that i will die soon or that death is on the horizon i have visions of my dead body on the floor i am doing my best to fight them but it's been very very hard i love life and i don't want to die but this experience has really shook me i feel like i am going mentally insane and cannot control my anxiety no matter how hard i try what started as panic attacks now feels like a full blown preoccupation with my own death that is preventing me from feeling well i feel like i have the flu and physically cannot relax i scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor who prescribed meds for bloating and an anti histamine for sleep and anxiety but i am so fearful i will have a severe allergic reaction or that it will make me feel worse that i cannot take them could there be something medical causing this extreme discomfort and sense of doom i feel so heavy and full of grief for so many things right now the weight of the world is on my chest it seems like every sensation in my body is causing me to panic i'm having sharp pains everywhere back pain bloating headaches jaw pain sinus pain i have always struggled health wise i have hypothyroidism migraines stomach issues extremely bad periods and i am always dismissed by doctors as just having anxiety but i am so fed up with genuinely feeling bad in my body that my soul feels tired is this just anxiety does anyone have any coping strategies or recommendations on moving forward,-0.055295972143798215,-0.9998,NEGATIVE,0.998812198638916,negative,negative,negative
Anxiety,1khjw49,HUGE list of anxiety symptoms to (hopefully) put you at ease. (Trigger warning),"**Cardiovascular symptoms** are the most common symptoms of anxiety. These symptoms include a fast/racing heart, shortness of breath, chest pain and/or tightness, air hunger (having a hard time getting a full, or satisfying breath), and heart palpitations (irregular heart beat, fluttering, pounding, or feeling like your heart is skipping a beat). Remember, if you had a sick heart, you'd feel symptoms 24/7, and they wouldn't stop when you're distracted. Your heart is way stronger than you think, and can sustain a lot.

**Gastrointestinal symptoms** are also extremely common with anxiety, chances are if you have an anxiety disorder, you've likely had some sort of GI issues, whether it be temporary, or long lasting. These symptoms include feeling a sudden urge to pass a bowel movement, constipation, diarrhea or loose stools, abdominal cramping, bloating and excessive gas, nausea, vomiting, appetite changes such as a decreased or increased appetite, belching, and morning sickness. Sometimes anxiety can even contribute to GI disorders such as IBS.

**Dizziness** is a very scary symptom of anxiety, but again, very common. These symptoms include vertigo, tunnel vision, loss of balance or trouble balancing, ""jelly legs"" (weakness or trembling in the legs), vision changes such as floaters, blurry vision,  and light sensitivity.

**Changes in body temperature.** These symptoms include hot/cold flashes, facial flushing, a burning sensation, feeling like your scalp is burning, chills, cold sweats, excessive sweating, sweaty palms and/or feet, and even a low grade fever.

**Overactive bladder symptoms.** These symptoms aren't often talked about, but also surprisingly common. These symptoms include frequent urination, an urgency to urinate (even if you don't need to), bladder incontinence. This happens because anxiety also causes muscle tension, which also effects the bladder.

**Reproductive symptoms** are symptoms that are often less discussed with anxiety, and typically only happen with prolonged, unmanaged anxiety disorders, or chronic stress. For men, these symptoms include decreased sperm production quality, changes in libido, decreased sperm motility, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain. For women, symptoms include irregular periods (spotting between periods, skipped periods, prolonged bleeding), changes in PMS symptoms, difficulty conceiving, reduced fertility, changes in libido.

**Musculoskeletal symptoms.** These symptoms include muscle cramps, muscle tension, muscle spasms, and muscle fatigue, and muscle stiffness. These symptoms can be all over your body, however they're most commonly in your legs, back, neck, and shoulders.

**Dissociation.** Dissociation is a common mental symptom of anxiety. This is your brain's way of protecting you from intense emotional stress. Symptoms of dissociation are feeling like you're in a dream, feeling like your body doesn't belong to you, light sensitivity, blurred vision, memory loss, feeling like your surroundings aren't real, altered sense of time, emotional numbness, deja vu, feeling like objects are much farther or much closer than they really are.

**Other mental illnesses** such as panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, depression, phobias, substance use disorders, and in rare cases, anxiety can be an early sign of schizophrenia.

**Impending doom** is an overwhelming feeling of dread, feeling as if something life threatening or tragic may happen, feeling an urgency to seek immediate medical care. Impending doom is a micro delusion, and you may feel as though you keep seeing ""signs"" that something terrible or tragic may happen to either you, or a loved one.

**Other mental symptoms** include brain fog, memory issues, irritability, mood swings, obsessive, violent, racing, or scary thoughts, paranoia, hallucinations, nightmares, nocturnal panic attacks, and confusion.

**Other symptoms.** Severe issues may occur due to prolonged, unmanaged anxiety (usually many years later), such as weakened immune system, heart issues, digestive disorders, chronic pain, sleep disorders, and hormonal imbalances.

**(UPDATE): There are also MANY OTHER SYMPTOMS that aren't discussed on this list. I've made this list based on my own experiences, other people's experiences, and my own research. If you suspect you have an anxiety disorder, I highly recommend researching its symptoms, and its effects on the mind and body. Anxiety is way more than just fear.**

You're not alone in any of this. Anxiety can be a huge, scary disorder. Make sure to take care of yourself and your health, both physically and mentally.

Anxiety,1kkk8kj,Health Anxiety experience so far..,"Quick notes:

\- Male in early 30s

\- History of depression

\- Switched from unhealthy \~3000+ calorie diet to \~1600 recently

\- Restarted anxiety medication after panic attack

\- Cut out caffeine cold turkey (360mg/day -> 0mg/day)

\- Had 3 days of constant waves of panic attacks leading to little to no sleep

\- Currently feeling low energy and depressed, occasional feeling of being strangled

\- Had close family member pass earlier this year

\- Lifted 2-3 times a week before panic attack but now lifted 3 days this last week with 1 hour of walking a day

\- Big panic attack triggered by thoughts of mortality

\- Unemployed for a year, took a temporary job, now have a job in my career field

\- Haven't gotten much sleep in the last week, moved from my bed to the couch as it gives me comfort

For a little bit of background; I'm a male in their early thirties who had high blood pressure in the past (stage 1 hypertension) but was able to bring it down with exercise and cutting out certain foods. I lost my job a year and a half ago and my mental health took a big hit. Once I ran out of insurance I stopped my anxiety/depression medication and fought for a way to cope with things. I had a lot of time to myself so I was sleeping a lot, playing games, reading whatever, and overall doing alright I suppose. I had a close family member pass away in March and was not able to attend the funeral due to a new temporary job (I regret this a lot). I picked up temporary work which helped pay the bills and keep the lights on. During all of this my diet wasn't so great but it wasn't as bad as it was last month.

Fast forward to a month ago; I get an offer for a golden opportunity in my career field and celebrate by eating Mcdonalds (two cheeseburgers + large fries), burgers, ice cream, two containers of onion pringles (370 calorie containers), two spicy nachos lunchables, and three protein shakes on pretty much a daily basis for a couple of weeks. Also, I had been consuming \~360mg (two cups of coffee + c4) on a daily basis for the last year.

During the three days of panic attacks I was hardly able to eat a thing and had a hard time drinking water. I felt constantly on edge and as if I was in a stranglehold until I would fall asleep. Even then I'd wake up at \~2:30am, without fail, and have a panic attack that would make my legs feel like jello. I'd have to tell myself that things will be alright and breath in and out of my emergency paper bag. I actually had a panic attack this morning at this time as well but it only lasted \~10 minutes before I fully calmed down.

It's officially been 8 days since I had a very bad panic attack from 1am to 4am and I believe that I've slowly been recovering. I still feel very depressed and a bit anxious but I have been consistently walking an hour a day for the last five days and doing 3 days of strength this last week. I have been coughing a little. I also scheduled a Dr.'s appointment next week so I'm very much looking forward to that.

I believe that my constant waves of panic attacks were fueled by restarting citalopram, caffeine withdrawal, and a big shift from a high sugar/unhealthy fatty diet to a very lean one.

Here's a timeline of events:

5/3: Panic attack from 1am to 4am, start citalopram from last years bottle I saved at 10mg. I sleep for around 7 hours

5/6: I cut coffee out completely (360mg/day -> 0mg/day). I sleep for around 6 hours

5/7: Tremors/waves of panic attacks start to occur and thinking becomes difficult, don't remember falling asleep. I do some strength training and walk around town for an hour. I hardly eat. I sleep for around 5 hours

5/8: Panic attacks continue, try to socialize but panic after an hour. Walk around the town for a couple of hours. I hardly eat. I sleep around 2 hours

5/9: Waves of panic attacks slow down and I'm able to consume food. I eat around 1000 calories. I walk for a couple of hours around the town. I then go to my gym and hit the stairmaster for 5 minutes and stationary bike for 15 minutes. Eyes are extremely bloodshot. I sleep for around 6 hours

5/10: Have occasional panic attacks through the day fueled by worries of mortality even with friends. I eat around 2000 calories. I walk around the town for and a half hours with a friend. I sleep for around 7 hours

5/11: I start off the morning by eating a light breakfast and walking for an hour and a half around my neighborhood. I watch a few videos on YouTube, take a nap for a couple of hours, and then proceed to walk for 15 minutes. I'm now writing up this post and wondering if things will get better or will I wake up at 2:30 again and break down.

Part of this post is to document what's been happening to me in case others can relate now, in the past, or the future. Another part is to gather my thoughts and hope that things will be much better a week from now.",2,1,quick notes male in early s history of depression switched from unhealthy calorie diet to recently restarted anxiety medication after panic attack cut out caffeine cold turkey mg day mg day had days of constant waves of panic attacks leading to little to no sleep currently feeling low energy and depressed occasional feeling of being strangled had close family member pass earlier this year lifted times a week before panic attack but now lifted days this last week with hour of walking a day big panic attack triggered by thoughts of mortality unemployed for a year took a temporary job now have a job in my career field haven't gotten much sleep in the last week moved from my bed to the couch as it gives me comfort for a little bit of background i'm a male in their early thirties who had high blood pressure in the past stage hypertension but was able to bring it down with exercise and cutting out certain foods i lost my job a year and a half ago and my mental health took a big hit once i ran out of insurance i stopped my anxiety depression medication and fought for a way to cope with things i had a lot of time to myself so i was sleeping a lot playing games reading whatever and overall doing alright i suppose i had a close family member pass away in march and was not able to attend the funeral due to a new temporary job i regret this a lot i picked up temporary work which helped pay the bills and keep the lights on during all of this my diet wasn't so great but it wasn't as bad as it was last month fast forward to a month ago i get an offer for a golden opportunity in my career field and celebrate by eating mcdonalds two cheeseburgers large fries burgers ice cream two containers of onion pringles calorie containers two spicy nachos lunchables and three protein shakes on pretty much a daily basis for a couple of weeks also i had been consuming mg two cups of coffee c on a daily basis for the last year during the three days of panic attacks i was hardly able to eat a thing and had a hard time drinking water i felt constantly on edge and as if i was in a stranglehold until i would fall asleep even then i'd wake up at am without fail and have a panic attack that would make my legs feel like jello i'd have to tell myself that things will be alright and breath in and out of my emergency paper bag i actually had a panic attack this morning at this time as well but it only lasted minutes before i fully calmed down it's officially been days since i had a very bad panic attack from am to am and i believe that i've slowly been recovering i still feel very depressed and a bit anxious but i have been consistently walking an hour a day for the last five days and doing days of strength this last week i have been coughing a little i also scheduled a dr 's appointment next week so i'm very much looking forward to that i believe that my constant waves of panic attacks were fueled by restarting citalopram caffeine withdrawal and a big shift from a high sugar unhealthy fatty diet to a very lean one here's a timeline of events panic attack from am to am start citalopram from last years bottle i saved at mg i sleep for around hours i cut coffee out completely mg day mg day i sleep for around hours tremors waves of panic attacks start to occur and thinking becomes difficult don't remember falling asleep i do some strength training and walk around town for an hour i hardly eat i sleep for around hours panic attacks continue try to socialize but panic after an hour walk around the town for a couple of hours i hardly eat i sleep around hours waves of panic attacks slow down and i'm able to consume food i eat around calories i walk for a couple of hours around the town i then go to my gym and hit the stairmaster for minutes and stationary bike for minutes eyes are extremely bloodshot i sleep for around hours have occasional panic attacks through the day fueled by worries of mortality even with friends i eat around calories i walk around the town for and a half hours with a friend i sleep for around hours i start off the morning by eating a light breakfast and walking for an hour and a half around my neighborhood i watch a few videos on youtube take a nap for a couple of hours and then proceed to walk for minutes i'm now writing up this post and wondering if things will get better or will i wake up at again and break down part of this post is to document what's been happening to me in case others can relate now in the past or the future another part is to gather my thoughts and hope that things will be much better a week from now,-0.02906492647564075,-0.9985,NEGATIVE,0.9957253932952881,neutral,negative,negative

going crazy, depression, s____, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar, bpd. Those sorts of things.

Anxiety,1kdufej,health anxiety,"a couple weeks ago, something sparked up in me and hasnt stopped and its torture dude. heart palpitations have been going crazy, ive been nauseous all day everyday, my toes and fingers are ALWAYS numb and tingly, i havent been able to eat normally and its making it so hard to function, especially with having these symptoms on top of having cystic fibrosis, just makes everything so much worse. its been about two weeks of these consistent symptoms and i took myself to the er early and got propranolol which has been my only saving grace (i wish i could have more of it :( twice a day isnt enough) so i know its nothing more than physical anxiety symptoms at this point but i just CANNOT shake the thought that this could push me into a terrible new cycle of health problems or that the er doctor missed something. im terrified. distractions dont always work. im literally on vacation in Nashville right now and its been terrible trying to walk anywhere or eat anything which is making me fucking depressed lol i dont wanna be this burden on everyone else (and on myself) i want to have fun goddamnit i just want to feel normal and fine like i did two weeks ago what the fuckkkkk 😭😭😭

I also had a visit with my PCP who put me on Fluoxetine, ive paused trying to take it while im on vacation because taking medications makes me anxious already and vacation already sucks enough with this shit, so idk how thatll turn out over the next month, everyone i know who has been on Fluoxetine fucking hates it so now im thinking i shouldve picked a different med to try and im stressed out about how long this fucking process is. Im scared that i wont feel well enough to keep my job, etc. I dont know what happened, i literally know im fine but i still feel like im gonna die everyday so what the fuck😭

Sorry i just really needed to vent somewhere i just feel so awful for everyone around me and honestly i feel fucking bad for myself because i was doing REALLY good mentally and physically. I was finally at my weight goal and it was staying consistent, now im down fucking 13 pounds. That was so hard to work up to and im so fucking upset that that progress just got swiped away over literally fucking nothing!!!!! Im so livid it's almost making me suicidal. (i dont want to die, i just dont want to fucking deal with this shit anymore im tired im tired im tired please)

Anxiety,1jlwhwe,"This might seem weird, but do any of you major anxiety sufferers have REALLY good oral hygiene and oral health??

My close friend who suffers from anxiety similar to me actually has always had really low oral hygiene. So made me wonder more.

Anxiety,1jriwci,Too Obsessed with Mental Health,"Hello all, I've been suffering with extreme anxiety for about a year now. Before then I was a pretty normal guy, and then I had a worrisome event that essentially broke me. I spend most of my time trying to figure out ways to ""fix myself."" I'm constantly on these anxiety forums and am now starting to look into the depression forums, which are a lot worse in my opinion as far as outlet. I have a therapist and a Psychiatrist, but I always am doing tons of research into the medications that they prescribe me to see how effective they will be.

Anxiety,1ivd9r0,Death/health anxiety/existentialism,"
Hey everyone

I’m a 21-year-old who has been living away from family for five years, usually seeing them once or twice a year. When I left them two months ago, I was more emotional than usual, knowing I might not see them for a long time. Shortly after, I had a severe viral infection with intense symptoms, including a fever-induced episode that triggered a hallucination/nightmare.

This triggered overwhelming health anxiety—I convinced myself I had brain cancer, visited my university clinic seven times in 14 days, and was reassured I was fine. But my fears shifted to having a heart attack in my sleep, then to constant thoughts of death—mine and my loved ones’. It’s all I think about when I talk to someone or even see strangers—I wonder how they will die and if they’ve ever received bad news about losing someone. This has been my reality for the past four weeks.  

I’m seeing a CBT therapist, but so far, I’ve only learned physical techniques for panic attacks. My doctor prescribed Prozac, but I hesitate to take it since some people say it made them feel emotionally disconnected, which I already struggle with. I had my first good day today after reconnecting with friends, yet I still feel like happiness is temporary and that I’m just distracting myself. Even as I write this, I feel disconnected from reality.  

I’ve also noticed that almost everyone I ask says they’re not okay, reinforcing my doubts about whether life can truly be enjoyable. It might sound naive, but I keep wondering—how do people survive for years after losing a loved one or dealing with mental health struggles? My anxiety has consumed me to the point that I’ve lost 8 kilos in two weeks, and I struggle to eat or focus on anything else.  

For context, I’m academically gifted and have always believed that ""nothing bad can happen to me,"" since back home, the worst thing was failing an exam (a foolish thought in hindsight). I also love to have answers and solutions for everything. i have no history of mental health issues, but this experience has made me realize that real hardships are inevitable, and I doubt my ability to handle them. I’ve started losing friends, feeling depressed 24/7, and failing classes—completely unlike me, as I’ve always been able to bounce back quickly.  

I’d really appreciate any life advice. This might not seem like the biggest problem, but it’s disrupting my entire life and making me question everything.

Anxiety,1ccflxz,I am so deeply anxious about getting older. (Tw: health anxiety),"I am 31. 32 in July, and I haven’t gotten used to even being 30 yet. 

It feels like I lost most of my 20s to unmedicated depression and ADHD. I made friends who ditched me, played games I don’t even remember now, spent so much time laying in bed and staring at the walls. Things are better now on all metrics even though I still spend more time than I’d like to bed rotting. 

But it feels like I wasted so much time. I’m not so delusional that I think 31 is *old* but it feels like I’m kidding myself by thinking I can count as *young* anymore. I still feel (mentally) like I’m maybe 25 at best. Aren’t 31-year-olds supposed to feel more grounded than this? Am I just going to keep wasting years and wake up at 40 and not know where the time went?

The worst part for me is I have had intense health anxiety for a long time now and my self-soothing method on that has always been looking at statistics for diseases in the < 35 demographic and seeing how low they are. I’m not going to be there for much longer. How do I convince myself I don’t have cancer every time something else in my body works when the statistics start saying yeah, this is around the time people usually get cancer! My cousin just finished chemo for ovarian cancer and she’s only 38. My dad died of lung cancer at 59. How far away is 39, really?

Sorry, this is sort of a vent I guess. Aging literally happens to everyone so everyone has to figure out how to mentally get through it. I feel like for me part of the problem is my social spaces are entirely online and most online spaces have a primarily 20-something demo, probably including this subreddit. It’s funny how I’ve watched “The Internet” go from being made up of “grown-ups” to being people my age to now being a bunch of kids. 

I wish I could stop time and just be where I am for a little longer, but I’ll be 32 in 3 months. I know the only actual alternative is to be dead. And I’m happy I’m in a place in life where that’s no longer the preferable option.

Anxiety,16thenk,"How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms, feedback loop, anxiety, my story, tips & advice)","Hi everyone, I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety, as well as some of the symptoms, mechanisms of DPDR, feedback loop, triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Please feel free to ask me any questions if you have any! I'd recommend you leave them as a comment on this thread, as it can help other readers find the answers to the question you might've already asked me!",1061,366,hi everyone i really wanted to do felt like i should make a separate master post for how i overcame dpdr depersonalization and derealization that was triggered by long term anxiety as well as some of the symptoms mechanisms of dpdr feedback loop triggers more i made a previous master post on my long term anxiety symptoms which i overcame where i went over the more bizarre rarely spoken about constant symptoms of long term anxiety and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people i will link that one below i recommend everyone read it first a lot of you wanted to know how i overcame the dp dr symptoms i didn't realise that i had message requests on reddit and now i've got so many spanning across months ago that i can't find the time to get back to individually so i feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place warning this is a big post lets go over some positives first as i find its always best to get off on a positive note and to have something to look forward to or motivate others dp dr depersonalization and derealization is not and is never permenant anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving these notions are not helpful and are also not true it will and can go away it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life dp dr does not work like a debt system e g the longer you are in dp dr the longer it is going to take you to get out of it isn't true everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from dp dr no matter how long or short you have been in that state dp dr is not indicative or a sign of psychosis and you will not become psychotic if you experience dp dr dp dr is a defense mechanism which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind by causing detachment causes of dp dr can be anxiety attacks severe stress health anxiety drug induced often from edibles or hallucinogens traumatic first hand or second hand situations abuse or any interpersonal trauma anyone of any age can experience dp dr what does dp dr feel like everything feels and looks either too close or too far away from you environments are distorted everything feels flat or d like it isn't quite real or tangible others faces might feel unreal can feel like the world is slipping away from you you might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor speech can feel slow slurred like your brain is struggling to find words time can feel like its going too fast or too slow feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body everything feels disconnected like you are very alone your limbs can feel too small too big like you are taller or shorter than you actually are you might feel internally dizzy like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't woozy head feelings fuzzy head more frequent feelings of nostalgia dejavu colours can feel more dull or distorted feeling numb like your memories are less tangible or unreal hypochondria healthy anxiety is often a huge comorbidity with dp dr the feedback loop what is it symptoms of dp dr as well as anxiety health anxiety are often kept alive by or started something called the feedback loop this is a loop that is constantly being fed into which could have started from something as for example you may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a panic attack but you misread it as being something worse you could think you're about to die that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations that you could collapse any moment now and then it goes but you're on edge what if it happens again do i have a heart condition i think i'm dying i think something is wrong everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations you're scared it will happen again you're getting waves of dread your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day then one day nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more you feel like you're slipping away you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again you're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal and it does its not going away whats happening this is the feedback loop example which led to dp dr or long term anxiety symptoms what should've happened when you experienced for example a panic attack was that you should've been able to realise it was a panic attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away this would eliminate the start of the feedback loop but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it you are now in fear in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you this keeps the loop alive and going in preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause dp dr in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing dp dr is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you identifying the first source of your dp dr can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your feedback loop started for some people it can even extend to as far as childhood which can sometimes result in something known as did dissociative identity disorder once you have identified the source this is the stepping stone into recovering from dp dr sources of dpdr can be drug induced from hallucinogens edibles bad trips alcohol or other substances anxiety attacks depression stress medical trauma childhood trauma adulthood trauma being a child of divorce sexual assaults csa ptsd did and more environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of dpdr e g stressful jobs stressful abusive relationships difficult home life being a full time carer for family difficult school life etc so what's going to help me get better there's a lot of resources and therapies available for dp dr such as psychotherapy talking therapies cbt dbt emdr and more but what is most important is that you are able to help yourself as well as having professional support should you require it the thing that is going to get you better the most is you and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma some people like me may be able to recover from dp dr without professional intervention or therapies but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it with dp dr being highly trauma related it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional as it can be tough to handle alone if you are concerned or suspect your dp dr may be a result of did dissociative identity disorder professional help is absolutely necessary every person with dp dr will be completely unique in their needs what they can handle alone or what they need support with what can we do for ourselves this is going to go over some self practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing dp dr or long term anxiety symptoms and also how to reduce the chances of re experiencing it when you are recovered staying busy challenging yourself a big part of dissolving the feedback loop is by no longer feeding into it and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of dp dr or anxiety symptoms you want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about dp dr or how it makes you feel 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it and to challenge those feelings instead dp dr and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life whether it is your hobbies being with your friends and family doing chores that need to be done starting things you've always wanted to do it can feel scary even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal like you're not present or that the world is slipping away but you must keep pushing through once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself don't be disheartened that dp dr or long term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight this is because your body hormonally needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels if these hormones were to plummet immediately the body wouldn't be able to cope so it likes to decline it gently so consider it like you are establishing trust dp dr has been in the drivers seat all this time and you've been the passenger in the back you're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat but dp dr insists on being the passenger right next to you dp dr is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it 'don't worry i've got this' and dp dr will let go of the wheel this in real life would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal' by doing this you are establishing trust and are giving dp dr the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own eventually with time of practicing these things dp dr will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of dp dr will be gone you'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or dp dr dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel you will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain your fear your trauma your anxiety stress etc without the need of the defence mechanism of dp dr you will become the first line of defence from personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from dp dr and long term anxiety symptoms within months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non stop dp dr and anxiety symptoms i learned to empathise with my dp dr's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better albeit in a scary and inconvenient way so by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of dp dr symptoms or my anxiety symptoms i gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''hey i am totally capable of caring for myself now thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my dp dr by feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal or because the world feels distorted you are allowing dp dr to maintain control and are keeping dp dr as an option challenge yourself in incriments or in steps and remember to reward yourself afterwards figure out what about dp dr makes you afraid is it seeing people's faces particularly friends or family challenge yourself towards looking at faces engaging with familiar faces youtubers family partners if you can touch their face then touch it grounding exercises where you say ''i can see two eyes they are insert colour they have a description nose do they have freckles birth marks do they have any smile lines identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary do little challenges before the bigger ones is it going outside in case you feel unreal woozy challenge yourself towards small short walks up and down your street to eventually longer walks acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy unreal but that you are safe be kind go home if you need it try again another day stay engaged with your hobbies the outside world is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again that you think its permenant that you've ruined your life the first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no ' and every other article will say no there has never been an observed case of dpdr being permenant and you won't be the first case of that happening its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own dpdr alive with the negativity i recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them and engaging with positive stories of dpdr recovery and sticking with facts you have not ruined your life and you will recover dpdr can make you feel afraid of lots of things not just the ones i described above but those are the most common grounding exercises grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you this is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current dp dr state but is most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety stress that could lead to it grounding exercises can involve naming things you can see name things you can touch and to touch them naming things you can hear and listening to them what things can you smell thing you can taste holding ice cubes putting your hands in cold water picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels is it cold warm does it feel rough or soft identifying their colours deeply walks without music tuning into the sounds of your steps counting your steps observing your surroundings on your walks sitting in the grass and touching it mental anchoring by saying in your head or quietly to yourself your full name your age where you live what street you live on the date where you are what you're doing repeat this gently until you feel calm self assurance phrases such as ''you are okay'' ''nothing can hurt me'' ''you will get through this'' ''i've done this once and i can do it again'' etc my example of how i personally recovered from dpdr for me i dealt with a lot of wooziness dizziness during my dp dr and i felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because i'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal ness from dp dr so i would lie on my side all day while watching tv or playing games instead to cope i wanted to turn 'oh god no i'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real i'm so scared' into 'oh i'm dizzy and feel unreal today lets see what i can manage' it started to become more of 'let's get up lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time' i'd do that for as long as i feel i could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations and then i'd lie back down again i rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult over time i'd start to sit up for longer or i'd start to go outside on short walks which was particularly hard as i'd feel more unreal outside than at home and i would feel unreal like everything was flat like the world was slipping away but i did it some days i would just cry or feel like i took steps back that i'd be stuck forever but i kept going and i kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs eating things i really loved engaging in self care or watching familiar tv shows i know i loved over time i started to sit up a lot more i started to stand more i started to go out more and for much much longer each time i started to do all the things i loved again despite how i felt don't get me wrong i still felt unreal and dizzy but i wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things i loved or wanted to do i stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good i'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can i manage today' that took away a lot of pressure for me as i knew i would not feel better over night but i would learn to manage my days better so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better you'll want to learn how to manage bad days whether dpdr days anxious days stressful days because when you do you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it one day after months of challenging myself being more present doing my hobbies going outside i remember this vividly i was hugging my partner and i looked up at his face and i physically jumped he looked real i started looking around everywhere and everything felt real everything looked so colorful the world didn't feel flat or distorted everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when i touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real i don't think i've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness my dpdr was gone everything probably felt like this for a while but because i was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things i loved i didn't actually realise it because i was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of dp dr so that one moment where i finally remembered to 'check' my reality it made me realise everything felt real again and that i felt human again and it never came back when you feel ready the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your dpdr and how it makes you feel by pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust those tools in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with dpdr to keep you safe some habits to get into and some to get rid of cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely as well as caffeine reduce or quit smoking all of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body and can impede progress from dp dr due to the sensations

Anxiety,1jd8ha7,When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me. And it’s a loop.",1,0,lately i ve been very overwhelmed by everything managing my life schedule new job new country health trying to be disciplined so i can be successful posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that i can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier is this all just an excuse for being weak and affected i know it s not true but i also wonder if it s true because my parents do this and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it and these are chronic my brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country i ve just moved to dubai the hospital seems suspicious i m not even sure if the insurance has coverage overwhelmed to check i ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and making a doctors appointment because i m terrified not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things i suspect and want to check like parasites lyme ticks etc sleep apnea and referral to physio i have chronic pain tension that moves around makes my body so stiff and stuck and weak at times mild hypermobility in some joints ibs crohn s anxiety reflux lots of food intolerances fatigue and feeling depressed from it all and not even sure if the physio other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment and medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to australia or singapore i ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it s not executing properly i can t even get the basics of sleep early and eating and journal meditate qigong which i m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art creative and post stuff to socials i also just started a new job in this country and it s an internship and i need to find a new job after months and i m also stressed about that and improving my design skills i am so tired and exhausted from late sleep lack of sleep anxiety pain poor circulation and not much exercise lately because i m so tired i just want to rest yet i think it s an excuse and i m not allowed because i didn t do the things i said i will do and doomscrolling for hours instead if i give in and just focus on my health how am i supposed to even succeed and get over this how will i ever get wealth if i keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now it s driving me crazy i m so overwhelmed and it s making me freeze and depressed and i just don t want to do anything because no energy and losing interest i want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me and it s a loop,-0.032231983702571944,-0.9966,NEGATIVE,0.99847012758255,neutral,negative,negative

Anxiety,1ia2jhj,"this is how i am dealing with/recovering from anxiety/health anxiety, and tips for you to as well!","hi everyone! this time about a year ago, i fell into the worst anxiety and mental health crisis of my life for about 3 months. in honor of the one year anniversary, i wanted to share my story on here to offer motivation and hope to those who are also struggling, or even struggling with the same things i did. (be prepared this is a yap session) 

i was 19 and had gone to the psychiatrist to get SSRIs because i was feeling mentally off during the winter. she gave me 20mg of prozac capsules, and i took them for a bit over 3 weeks and literally had my life changed. my body rejected the meds around the third week (mid-february) and i experienced nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and my very first real panic attack. i genuinely thought i was going to die. this reaction, along with the panic attack, led me to 3 months of hell.   
  
i thought my brain was damaged forever, i was always on the verge of tears, i was so anxious, depressed, i felt so many bodily sensations, and i couldn't. stop. googling. googling my symptoms, constantly looking up how many days had it been since the first panic attack, just everything combined was so extremely isolating and terrifying to experience alone. i seriously thought i was part of some minority population on earth who would never go back to normal again after these drugs. then, it went from being worried about the drugs to focusing on breathing, blinking, and swallowing, dpdr, thinking weird, and sooo many other ocd/anxious tics.

ALSO! i posted on reddit nearly everyday, constantly looking for reassurance. i used to post in this community along with health anxiety, depression, panic attack, literally any mentally ill group you could find on here.

as you read, my health anxiety and anxiety were horrible. i couldn't enjoy life. it was taking a toll on me (i lost nearly 20 pounds, didn't eat, slept 4 hours a night, crying myself to sleep, PRAYING (i am not religious at all), extremely pale all the time, couldn't focus, brain fog, dizzy) as well as my family (having to hear me spiral, being annoying!). the last month of the three i decided i needed to change.

i realized that i was stuck in these loops because of me and only me. there was nothing and nobody that would ""save"" me from this, and that i really just had to start ""moving on"", as i would call it. how did i do this? i started living life.   
  
firstly, i didn't allow myself to google. number one thing for us anxiety havers. i started by distracting myself whenever i would get anxious thoughts, and if the sensations got bad, i would calm myself down and tell myself, ""you've felt like this before and you were fine after. you're gonna be okay"" (like that one emma chamberlain audio) amongst other reassuring quotes. i sometimes listened to podcasts (shoutout disordered podcast on spotify!) about the situation because it helped me understand a lot about myself. i also went outside - shocker. i went on bike rides with my friends, applied to lifeguarding a second time (greatest decision ever), discovered new music, tried new foods (i love pho), went to see movies (challengers was so good), played more video games with my friends, indulged myself in things i used to enjoy. slowly, little by little, the feelings disappeared. by june (4 months), i stopped feeling anxious. 

this was hard because i had to force myself to think positively. not in the way that some people shove happiness down your throat, but in the way that i had to change my mindset and how i view the world. i started thanking anxiety for giving me these new experiences. i had bad days, of course. i used to call these set backs, but after changing my point of view, i only view them as hurdles that i could jump over and continue running.

do i still get anxious? of course i do! i still get anxious, depressed, and dissociated. it was pretty bad this past winter due to extremely stressful classes (shoutout physics i hate you), but since i already developed my coping habits, it is a ton easier to deal with it. i still deal with pretty bad winter mental health in general, but this doesn't mean i lose all hope as i did before.   
  
am i the same as i was before? no! but, why would i want to go back to how i was before? i feel so much more content and happy with my life than i did before anxiety. i really am truly glad that anxiety has brought me a new perspective on life. i feel like i lived more than i did before. and i am so excited to see what the future holds for me (especially as an engineering student).

on the topic of being a student, i was also taking 16 credits at community college during this entire time. general chemistry 2, calc 1, all the stem classes. also, my (ex) boyfriend of 2 years cheated on me   because of how bad the anxiety got (he claimed he didn't want to deal with it/me anymore or be there for me). i was working a stressful medical receptionist job with changing providers and angry patients. its not impossible to better yourself or your mental health when life is constantly throwing things at you - think of it as a challenge rather than ""holding you down"". 

there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. i hope to whoever is still reading this feels more comfortable knowing theres people out there like me who survived the worse. anxiety will never fully go away, it will always be with you. but, the things you do to help yourself are what matter most, and it is definitely not impossible to start bettering yourself and your mental health. you got this!

population on earth who would never go back to normal again after these drugs then it went from being worried about the drugs to focusing on breathing blinking and swallowing dpdr thinking weird and sooo many other ocd anxious tics also i posted on reddit nearly everyday constantly looking for reassurance i used to post in this community along with health anxiety depression panic attack literally any mentally ill group you could find on here as you read my health anxiety and anxiety were horrible i couldn't enjoy life it was taking a toll on me i lost nearly pounds didn't eat slept hours a night crying myself to sleep praying i am not religious at all extremely pale all the time couldn't focus brain fog dizzy as well as my family having to hear me spiral being annoying the last month of the three i decided i needed to change i realized that i was stuck in these loops because of me and only me there was nothing and nobody that would save me from this and that i really just had to start moving on as i would call it how did i do this i started living life firstly i didn't allow myself to google number one thing for us anxiety havers i started by distracting myself whenever i would get anxious thoughts and if the sensations got bad i would calm myself down and tell myself you've felt like this before and you were fine after you're gonna be okay like that one emma chamberlain audio amongst other reassuring quotes i sometimes listened to podcasts shoutout disordered podcast on spotify about the situation because it helped me understand a lot about myself i also went outside shocker i went on bike rides with my friends applied to lifeguarding a second time greatest decision ever discovered new music tried new foods i love pho went to see movies challengers was so good played more video games with my friends indulged myself in things i used to enjoy slowly little by little the feelings disappeared by june months i stopped feeling anxious this was hard because i had to force myself to think positively not in the way that some people shove happiness down your throat but in the way that i had to change my mindset and how i view the world i started thanking anxiety for giving me these new experiences i had bad days of course i used to call these set backs but after changing my point of view i only view them as hurdles that i could jump over and continue running do i still get anxious of course i do i still get anxious depressed and dissociated it was pretty bad this past winter due to extremely stressful classes shoutout physics i hate you but since i already developed my coping habits it is a ton easier to deal with it i still deal with pretty bad winter mental health in general but this doesn't mean i lose all hope as i did before am i the same as i was before no but why would i want to go back to how i was before i feel so much more content and happy with my life than i did before anxiety i really am truly glad that anxiety has brought me a new perspective on life i feel like i lived more than i did before and i am so excited to see what the future holds for me especially as an engineering student on the topic of being a student i was also taking credits at community college during this entire time general chemistry calc all the stem classes also my ex boyfriend of years cheated on me because of how bad the anxiety got he claimed he didn't want to deal with it me anymore or be there for me i was working a stressful medical receptionist job with changing providers and angry patients its not impossible to better yourself or your mental health when life is constantly throwing things at you think of it as a challenge rather than holding you down there is always a light at the end of the tunnel i hope to whoever is still reading this feels more comfortable knowing theres people out there like me who survived the worse anxiety will never fully go away it will always be with you but the things you do to help yourself are what matter most and it is definitely not impossible to start bettering yourself and your mental health you got

Anxiety,1ibmsmi,health anxiety is ruining my mental health.,"i cannot stress enough how bad my health anxiety is and it all started in May when i had chest pain and dealing with constipation. ever since then, i cannot relax and my anxiety just happens out of nowhere. i can just be having a good time, listening to music, doing things that make me happy then suddenly it just… hits me then i google then google says i have cancer, blood clots, diseases, all of the above then my mood is completely ruined and i can’t do anything and i just sit there accepting my fate. then my brain starts to show scenarios of me getting diagnosed, me getting worse, at the hospital on my death bed, then finally me passing away and my family grieving me.

i cannot explain how many times i have cried over this because i just wanna get better and it doesn’t help that i google literally EVERYTHING especially something i’m really afraid of having like cancer or some disease that can kill me. i match my symptoms up with said condition and i relax myself and say, “i don’t have ___, i need to calm down” then like an hour or so later, i’m experiencing the symptoms and i start freaking out. i have been to the hospital three times and they all tell me the same thing when i went for my constipation. they told me i just need to eat better which was fine for me but at the same time i’m a picky eater too so it was also kind of hard as well. second time i went to the hospital for sharp stomach pain i was diagnosed with a UTI and little old me decided to google it and i found out it can lead to kidney issues and possible SEPSIS! so i was in the car silently freaking out and again… accepting my fate. 

third time i went back because i was having MORE sharp stomach pain to the point i started crying because i was so scared and again. they told me it’s my UTI and constipation. i’m spiraling right now, i cannot relax and i’m so scared of telling my family and wanting reassurance because i’m so afraid that i’m being annoying. i’m always texting my mother about my new symptoms and i can tell she’s annoyed and i’m annoyed with myself. it also doesn’t help that when i read about other people’s symptoms or other people that have health anxiety, they also start showing symptoms when they read about other symptoms too. i read about somebody having calf pain and guess what? i have calf pain now and all i can think of is, “you have a blood clot in ur leg, ur gonna die!!” or “you have ___ go to the hospital now!”

my health anxiety is really making me depressed and i cannot have a normal day anymore without worrying it’s gonna be my last. i’m scared, tired, anxious, stressed. i also read that this is also a symptom of OCD and my mom also suffers from it too so that can also be a reason. i really wanna go to a therapist and vent my fucking heart out and cry and cry. it also doesn’t help that i may also have ADHD or autism too because i cannot sit still, i’m so hyper, i run around my apartment, and im also throwing myself on everything or jumping on things. i try to tell myself it’s my fault that my body is this way but at the same time, i cannot relax. i’m so convinced i’m dying.",4,2,i cannot stress enough how bad my health anxiety is and it all started in may when i had chest pain and dealing with constipation ever since then i cannot relax and my anxiety just happens out of nowhere i can just be having a good time listening to music doing things that make me happy then suddenly it just hits me then i google then google says i have cancer blood clots diseases all of the above then my mood is completely ruined and i can t do anything and i just sit there accepting my fate then my brain starts to show scenarios of me getting diagnosed me getting worse at the hospital on my death bed then finally me passing away and my family grieving me i cannot explain how many times i have cried over this because i just wanna get better and it doesn t help that i google literally everything especially something i m really afraid of having like cancer or some disease that can kill me i match my symptoms up with said condition and i relax myself and say i don t have i need to calm down then like an hour or so later i m experiencing the symptoms and i start freaking out i have been to the hospital three times and they all tell me the same thing when i went for my constipation they told me i just need to eat better which was fine for me but at the same time i m a picky eater too so it was also kind of hard as well second time i went to the hospital for sharp stomach pain i was diagnosed with a uti and little old me decided to google it and i found out it can lead to kidney issues and possible sepsis so i was in the car silently freaking out and again accepting my fate third time i went back because i was having more sharp stomach pain to the point i started crying because i was so scared and again they told me it s my uti and constipation i m spiraling right now i cannot relax and i m so scared of telling my family and wanting reassurance because i m so afraid that i m being annoying i m always texting my mother about my new symptoms and i can tell she s annoyed and i m annoyed with myself it also doesn t help that when i read about other people s symptoms or other people that have health anxiety they also start showing symptoms when they read about other symptoms too i read about somebody having calf pain and guess what i have calf pain now and all i can think of is you have a blood clot in ur leg ur gonna die or you have go to the hospital now my health anxiety is really making me depressed and i cannot have a normal day anymore without worrying it s gonna be my last i m scared tired anxious stressed i also read that this is also a symptom of ocd and my mom also suffers from it too so that can also be a reason i really wanna go to a therapist and vent my fucking heart out and cry and cry it also doesn t help that i may also have adhd or autism too because i cannot sit still i m so hyper i run around my apartment and im also throwing myself on everything or jumping on things i try to tell myself it s my fault that my body is this way but at the same time i cannot relax i m so convinced i m dying,-0.023940737911326147,-0.9982,NEGATIVE,0.9973021745681763,neutral,negative,negative
Anxiety,1in142q,Suggestions for my mental health,"I would stay away from this post if you are sensitive to death or what ig some would consider emotional abuse. If you still want to help but don’t want to read about that stuff I have added a TLDR at the bottom.

I’m 17 almost 18 and idk how I’m going to do anything. I have depression anxiety and agoraphobia. To put it into perspective, I live just outside of my local town and haven’t gone into town besides my doctors visits every 3 months and when I took my final test for school, and that has been for the past 2 years or so my room is a mess and I have gone at least 3-6 weeks without showering a few times. The “bad part” started happening in junior year I had recently lost my great grandmother and it wasn’t quick either, she slowly died suffering from dementia. Anyways it was a few days into junior year when I had a large mental break and went to the hospital and barely got away from being sent to a psychiatric hold. At this point the only thing that stopped me from doing something I wouldn’t be able to regret was my cat and most days he still is. But later I managed to talk to my school and I got into an online schooling thing I didn’t even have the energy for that so my mom did most of my work for me just so I could graduate. The next few months up until now I have not left the house except for the few times stated earlier. At this point I’m just fed up with this life of mine but I can’t do anything to change it. My doc tells me to exercise which I would if I had the energy, motivation, and willpower so that doesn’t help. He also suggests meditation and breath work but I already do both. My mom gets mad at me if I try to talk about this with her, I think it’s because she’s scared she can’t help. I’m starting to come to the realization that my life is near rock bottom and I have to be the one to fix that but I don’t know how. to get to the point if anyone has a similar issue to this I would be so grateful for any advice even if it sounds stupid the smallest stuff would be the most help.

TLDR: I’m agoraphobic and depressed and don’t have the energy to do anything from brushing my teeth to leaving the house. I just need help even small suggestions on how to help myself. 

Ps IK this is probably written terribly, I haven’t slept in a while and failed English a lot of times. That’s not the point though I just need help any suggestions are welcome and even greatly appreciated.

Anxiety,1hvdss9,I'm on academic probation and lost my health insurance ,"I screwed up last term, I failed a class. I just need to vent because I don't know what to do. I have a severe learning disability and ASD which has made it so hard to graduate in my major. Accommodations don't really help, I've been petitioning out of certain classes and replacing them with others so I can pass and graduate. I'm 27 and have been in college since I was 18. It's a long story, but that's the gist of it. I failed a class last term, I'm already on precarious ground so it sent me into academic probation. I deserve it...but damn, taking away my health insurance feels a little cold no? I've been working with therapists, a pyschiatrist and am trying to find the right medication for my mental illnesses and it just got all taken away from me. I guess I'm just frustrated because I really want to do well, but the depression and anxiety have been brutal these last few years. Im completely burnt out. I was supposed to get tested for ADHD this term too. Considering how bad my anxiety and depression is right now *on* medication I'm terrified of what will happen when it's gone. I have no income, I've been trying to focus on just schoolwork. These last few weeks my anxiety and depression have worsened significantly, and now all possible help is taken away. I've even become suicidal, but now I have no recourse for that. Cant even go to the hospital if i needed to. I should have dropped the class last term, but I was too stubborn. Too stupid, I so desperately wanted to prove that I could. And I failed. Now I need to somehow fix my depression and anxiety without any help and get out of academic probation.

Anxiety,1hmbp77,How to stay calm when you have health problems?,"I have been pretty much healthy my whole life except mental health, horrible anxiety and depression. And my way of coping with anxiety was always telling myself that I won't die from that and therapists encouraged that- you won't die, it's just an unpleasant sensation.

Due to horrible stress and abuse I ended up being sick. Very dangerous hypertension and heart problems and suddenly I have allergies to two antibiotics (at least I know for two, maybe there is more) that I haven't had before.

So basically, my biggest fears became true. Fear of dying from anaphylactic shock and from heart attack or stroke or even worse, become permamently completely disabled. Fear of having an infection and dying from it because there are no meds that I can take. And I am prone to infections.

That made my anxiety so bad that a doctor doubled up my dose of Xanax and even with that I barely find a relief. He doubled up my dose of Zoloft too and still, I am in so much fear.

I have all new dangers and I can't find a solution. My BP was perfect when I was calm and collected in October after months of horrible anxiety but then allergies happened and I am spiralling again. I don't know how to help myself.

Anxiety,1ggeaby,Scared to bring up mental health concerns with doctor ,"Ive been debating getting support for my mental health for years and now that I'm in college I feel like its the best time to try. After weeks of physcing myself out, I finally made an appointment with my schools doctor but the reality of it is hitting me and im not sure what to do. 

 I feel like I've just been in limbo for years, not well but not in a crisis either and I just don't want to live that forever. But, if I go to the appointment and they tell me nothings wrong I don't know what ill do.

I always feel this buzz of anxiety about everything around me, assuming people are going to hurt me or hate me but its been like this for so long that I've convinced myself its normal even though, deep down, I feel like it might not be. 

At the same time, those things just don't feel important enough to get help about, I don't want to die and I haven't hurt anybody so it might just be apart of life.

Anxiety,1exe482,I feel embarrassed about applying for FMLA for mental health,"I’m a teacher and last year there was a point (two actually) where I really felt like I needed to go inpatient because my anxiety and depression were so bad that I couldn’t function but I had to go interact with elementary schoolers all day and pretend to be okay.

Anxiety,17nu7jv,"Extreme health anxiety, panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts - am I going insane?","Hi there, last year was fucking brutal. It saw the end of my business, I was a witness to a very bad, violent accident that left me with symptoms of ptsd for a while, and I had panic attack because of some vision or balance system problem, vitamin D deficiency, health scares, and other problems.

I also quit smoking and coffee about 5 weeks ago.

All these things kinda came one after the other, I used to be a very mentally resilient before that. But I feel I just got a too big of a burden to bear and something changed in my emotional resilience, and now cumulated in a almost-rapid decline of my mental health.

The tipping point was vertigo attacks, which for some reason were so panic inducing in me - it left me absolutely paralysed with fear. At the same time I quit cigarettes cold turkey. These two things combined just made me so good damn anxious. Like the anxiety was through the roof because on one hand I couldn’t handle no smoking, and the withdrawals were absolutely brutal for my mental health, and on the other hand the vertigo and bad eyesight gave raise to a health anxiety - I though for real I was having cancer and soooo obsessed over it.

This was last month - the anxiety was probably worst in my life. With that came racing thoughts, and sometimes but not often inability to calm down, instead of drifting off to sleep I would be so sure I had cancer I thought I was going crazy when falling asleep and then waking up, and repeat the process. I was afraid to go to sleep.

During that time I did so many tests… mris, blood tests, inner ear tests - everything my neurologist said could cause vertigo. 

Then a couple of days ago I had yet another vertigo attack plus nausea. It wasn’t anything so bad comparable for example to a flu or something - but my anxiety was so fricking bad, I went to ER. My symptoms there I was agitated, had bowel movements, was nauseous, and felt slightly off balance. But I was so anxious and sure I was dying I was the most agitated I was in life.

The doctor took a very long time to go through all my tests - and there were so many - and managed to convince me that I wasn’t dying. Which was the only thing I wanted to hear, as after that accident thing I became a bit phobic of death. Like I’m petrified by the concept. The doctor was amazing and convinced a hypochondriac (to an extent) that I’m not dying. They said I look like someone who is over medicated on thyroid medication - and it’s true, they upped my dosage significantly and my stomach hurts, I pee a lot, and I’m supper jittery - despite being super healthy.

But the thing is - once that bit of info clicked in my brain. Immediately the anxiety latched onto something different - something I know slightly from the past - intrusive thoughts. They are quite morbid, and super distressing. It makes me feel like I’m a bad person for having them, and that I’m going insane. And the worst part of this is that the more I try to resist them - the more elaborate they come back. I’m super afraid I’m a danger to myself or others - but I know for a fact I would never ever act on these thoughts. And sometimes I have to admit they are quite hilarious as opposed to morbid - for example I think what would happen if I defrauded my company’s money. This is super distressing when it happens, because I feel like I’m a bad person who can’t control these thoughts. But then I remember that only a week ago I paid back what I was overpaid by my bank - making a big scene that I don’t want any free money. It’s just such a contrast. Other times it’s about driving a car and crashing it, becoming a criminal, etc. 

These thoughts come only when I’m super anxious. When I’m relaxed or straight after waking up - they don’t come. But then the first one comes - and then I obsess: am I crazy, or am I evil?

It’s super super terrifying when it happens - but is a non issue when I’m calm, or interested in something. I have absolutely no interest in following these thoughts, it’s almost like they are used to up the anxiety. To make me scared for my health. Three days ago I was thinking I had cancer - now I think I’m going properly insane. 

When I’m in the thick of it - I’m petrified I could do something crazy. But when I’m calm - it’s like the most ridiculous proposition. I also had these types of thoughts before:

Ages ago I was diagnosed with a generalised anxiety disorder - and when the anxiety was really bad, I had very similar problems. If not the same really. I remember really disturbing thoughts and self hate after they appeared. I was put on medications and therapy - and I was symptoms free for what 15 years. To the point where I forgot about it.


So my question is: am I crazy, like in schizofrenia? I don’t hear voices, and I’m not depressed, I just have hard time regulating my own thoughts - like in a good state of mind I’d thing: what a silly idea, and not pay any attention to it. And now here any weird thought is a proof I’m crazy, and won’t ever have a happy life. Which is super weird because a couple of days ago it was cancer.

Obviously I signed up to see a psychiatrist in 2 days. And will go to therapy - but my question is: am i like criminally insane? Should I worry I’m a danger to myself or others? Or is it just anxiety? This question is even kinda funny to write out - I know the answer if you asked my calm mind, but I’m anxiety personified atm, and can’t relax over this, the same I couldn’t relax I had cancer before the doctor convinced me I don’t. It’s obsessive worry I feel. Please advise.",15,29,hi there last year was fucking brutal it saw the end of my business i was a witness to a very bad violent accident that left me with symptoms of ptsd for a while and i had panic attack because of some vision or balance system problem vitamin d deficiency health scares and other problems i also quit smoking and coffee about weeks ago all these things kinda came one after the other i used to be a very mentally resilient before that but i feel i just got a too big of a burden to bear and something changed in my emotional resilience and now cumulated in a almost rapid decline of my mental health the tipping point was vertigo attacks which for some reason were so panic inducing in me it left me absolutely paralysed with fear at the same time i quit cigarettes cold turkey these two things combined just made me so good damn anxious like the anxiety was through the roof because on one hand i couldn t handle no smoking and the withdrawals were absolutely brutal for my mental health and on the other hand the vertigo and bad eyesight gave raise to a health anxiety i though for real i was having cancer and soooo obsessed over it this was last month the anxiety was probably worst in my life with that came racing thoughts and sometimes but not often inability to calm down instead of drifting off to sleep i would be so sure i had cancer i thought i was going crazy when falling asleep and then waking up and repeat the process i was afraid to go to sleep during that time i did so many tests mris blood tests inner ear tests everything my neurologist said could cause vertigo then a couple of days ago i had yet another vertigo attack plus nausea it wasn t anything so bad comparable for example to a flu or something but my anxiety was so fricking bad i went to er my symptoms there i was agitated had bowel movements was nauseous and felt slightly off balance but i was so anxious and sure i was dying i was the most agitated i was in life the doctor took a very long time to go through all my tests and there were so many and managed to convince me that i wasn t dying which was the only thing i wanted to hear as after that accident thing i became a bit phobic of death like i m petrified by the concept the doctor was amazing and convinced a hypochondriac to an extent that i m not dying they said i look like someone who is over medicated on thyroid medication and it s true they upped my dosage significantly and my stomach hurts i pee a lot and i m supper jittery despite being super healthy but the thing is once that bit of info clicked in my brain immediately the anxiety latched onto something different something i know slightly from the past intrusive thoughts they are quite morbid and super distressing it makes me feel like i m a bad person for having them and that i m going insane and the worst part of this is that the more i try to resist them the more elaborate they come back i m super afraid i m a danger to myself or others but i know for a fact i would never ever act on these thoughts and sometimes i have to admit they are quite hilarious as opposed to morbid for example i think what would happen if i defrauded my company s money this is super distressing when it happens because i feel like i m a bad person who can t control these thoughts but then i remember that only a week ago i paid back what i was overpaid by my bank making a big scene that i don t want any free money it s just such a contrast other times it s about driving a car and crashing it becoming a criminal etc these thoughts come only when i m super anxious when i m relaxed or straight after waking up they don t come but then the first one comes and then i obsess am i crazy or am i evil it s super super terrifying when it happens but is a non issue when i m calm or interested in something i have absolutely no interest in following these thoughts it s almost like they are used to up the anxiety to make me scared for my health three days

Anxiety,1hfd7q6,Struggling to Cope with Negative News and Its Impact on My Mental Health,"Hi everyone, I'm a 28-year-old male, I am very sensitive,and I have a hard time dealing with negative news or anything that feels unjust. Whenever I hear or see negative stories, I feel stressed, overwhelmed, and often fall into a depression that makes it impossible to focus on work.

In today's world, there's so much negativity—racism, injustice, and general bad news—that I find it really hard to accept. It consumes my thoughts all day long, and it's starting to affect my mental health and work performance.

For many people, they might see these things, think ""that's wrong,"" and then move on with their day. But for me, it ruins my day entirely, and I can't seem to shake the feeling. I even stopped using Instagram to avoid it, but I still come across negative posts on LinkedIn and Facebook, which leave me feeling depressed for hours.

I’m just wondering, is there something wrong with me? Why does this affect me so much more than others?",1,3,hi everyone i'm a year old male i am very sensitive and i have a hard time dealing with negative news or anything that feels unjust whenever i hear or see negative stories i feel stressed overwhelmed and often fall into a depression that makes it impossible to focus on work in today's world there's so much negativity racism injustice and general bad news that i find it really hard to accept it consumes my thoughts all day long and it's starting to affect my mental health and work performance for many people they might see these things think that's wrong and then move on with their day but for me it ruins my day entirely and i can't seem to shake the feeling i even stopped using instagram to avoid it but i still come across negative posts on linkedin and facebook which leave me feeling depressed for hours i m just wondering is there something wrong with me why does this affect me so much more than others,-0.12714285714285709,-0.9895,NEGATIVE,0.9988536834716797,negative,negative,negative
Anxiety,1hzbycg,My sister needs mental health help and I don't know what to do.,"My sister needs mental health help and I don’t know where to start. She is 41. She’s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, PTSD, trichotillomania, anxiety and depression. 

She can’t hold down a job – any job. She can’t form or maintain friendships or life partners because per personality is so erratic. She’s prone to emotional outburst and does not acknowledge that her actions affect others. She lies, steals, and self-medicates with cannabis and alcohol.

I watched her grow up and change from a sweetheart to a cold, bitter person. My parents were abusive and she went through a few abusive dating relationships as well. In 10 years, I'm afraid she's going to be homeless or end up in a state run mental hospital.

I think she needs long-term, inpatient, cognitive behavior therapy at a residential facility. I don't know how to go about finding a care center. She isn't suicidal which seems to be criteria for being accepted by these facilities. I also don't think she would need a involuntary hold or anything. Most places seem to be aimed at teenagers.

I don't want her to be in a place where she feels punished, like having restrictions on her possessions.

Anxiety,1h0pthd,How do you take a mental health day off work? (Sorry Long post/rant warning),"I’m not doing too well lately. My borderline agoraphobia has got worse (I can just about manage to go to work but struggle with doing anything else, even visiting friends or family that live in the same town)

I actually don’t mind my job I have lovely colleagues (mostly) and I don’t always dread going in to work. Non of my colleagues really know about my mental health struggles and when I mention anxiety or depression it’s often said in line with a joke. I am very good at masking how I feel at work and even if I’m really struggling I tend to take myself off for a few moments if I can or I mask it which causes me to be even more exhausted than I already am and at weekends I just crash and can’t do anything.    

Obviously it’s the run up to Christmas so we’re quite busy at the moment and tonight I’m especially anxious and have very low mood (no particular reason, other than the Christmas season coming up, the expectation to be around people more and my mum has planned a day out this coming weekend which is filling me with dread already, even though it’s something I want to do I don’t want to go out of you catch my drift) 

I’m lying in bed and I just can’t face work tomorrow. I’m thinking of phoning in in the morning saying I can’t go in because I have a “migraine” I do suffer with migraines and work is aware of this. I just feel like I can’t phone in and say “I’m too anxious or I’m too depressed to do life today” because I’m normally the ditzy, clumsy joker that I’ve masked myself into so I’m not sure they’d understand how bad I feel. 

Sorry for the rant but how do you guys take a day off if you need it? I’m so done of hiding how I feel everyday

Anxiety,1hargdh,"""Need Help - Severe Health Issues After Panic Attack-like Episode, Intense Confusion, Extreme Slowness, Chronic Fatigue, Memory Loss, and Visual Changes - Can't Find Answers""","Hi everyone,

I’m 27 years old, and something happened back in July that completely changed my life. I’ve been dealing with some really distressing symptoms, and I’m hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or can offer advice.

It all started in March when I developed health anxiety related to my bowel, which caused a lot of stress. After seeing doctors, I was reassured that I was healthy and nothing was wrong. However, around that time, I also started developing severe insomnia. I went from sleeping 8+ hours a night to sometimes just 1-2 hours. This went on for months, and I kept hoping it would get better, but the lack of sleep only made my anxiety worse. I began experiencing intense anxiety attacks and heart palpitations at night, despite trying various natural remedies.

During this time, my memory was fine, and I wasn’t noticing anything extreme besides the depression caused by lack of rest. But then, on July 24th, something happened that really changed everything. After months of poor sleep, I had a severe panic attack-like episode. I couldn’t stop shaking in bed for hours. I ended up going to the ER, but they didn’t find anything physically wrong and couldn’t offer much help. When I got home, I noticed a dramatic shift in how my brain was functioning. Suddenly, I became extremely forgetful, confused, and had constant brain fog. Time seemed warped, and I felt incredibly slow mentally.

Additionally, I’ve developed severe short-term memory problems, and I struggle to remember even the simplest things. My cognitive abilities have taken a serious hit, and it’s really affecting my day-to-day life. Before all this, I was energetic, always on the go, and worked as a VFX artist in a fast-paced environment. But now, I have chronic fatigue and feel mentally and physically drained all the time.

The doctors prescribed me sleep medication, but it barely helps. I’m still unable to sleep properly, and the fatigue and brain fog just continue. I’ve also been experiencing persistent visual changes, like tunnel vision 24/7, with blurry peripheral vision. I had an MRI done, and while the doctor didn’t find any masses or abnormalities, I’m planning on getting a second opinion from neurologists.

Has anyone experienced anything like this or have any ideas on what might have happened? I’ve been trying to figure this out for months, and I’d be really grateful for any insights or suggestions. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Anxiety,1cj2gvs,Intense health anxiety since taking antibiotics,"I was an anxious person before but since I got sick and needed to take a 3 day course of antibiotics my life has been living hell for about 10 days now.

It started with stomach problems. One night I woke up to having intense stomach pain and acid reflux. An intense headache appeared, my body started tingling very intensly and my ears were ringing.

Since then every night I have this constant tingling sensation that is the worst at night, my mouth and eyes easily become dehydrated despite drinking regularly and I have to eat very carefully to avoid stomach pain. Im struggling to reach my calories with a very plain diet. I lost about 4kg (7-8lbs) in 2 weeks, despite not being overweight already.

Meanwhile im having extreme anxiety about all of this. I understand that anxiety and stress can make you feel things that are extremely real but these symptoms are all new to me despite dealing with anxiousness beforehand for a long time. But then again anxiety and depression has been consuming me lately so maybe its coming from my head. This uncertainty is destroying me..

My doctor is very dismissive and says that its all stress related despite not having done any tests.

Today I had my blood tested, no results yet and I have an appointment with a neurologist.

I fear that the antibiotics have caused an autoimmune disease, neuropathy or even worse. Im 24 years old, male but im scared I wont live for long…

Anxiety,yuo9xy,Health anxiety is destroying my life,"I’m a 33/f and I am so annoyed of living with the constant fear of “I’m dying” or “someone is dying”.

I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression my whole life but after I had my daughter in 2020, my anxiety spiraled out of control. I have been able to keep it under control until here recently. I had a spot on my back I wanted to get checked out because it didn’t feel right and it ended up being cancer. Thankfully they were able to remove it but it was still the “trust your gut” anxiety that did it for me or else I wouldn’t have. Fast forward a few months and I started having these weird chest pains. A very dull pain but still in the left side of my sternum which is a cause for concern since heart disease runs in my family. I ignored it for the first few weeks, anxiety wasn’t happening, but as of the past two weeks, the panic really hit hard.

Nothing changed in my symptoms but the thoughts of “I’m dying and I am going to leave my daughter behind” started and took me into a dark place. I scheduled a doctors appointment, she checked me out saying it was probably muscle spasms, and increased my anxiety medication to the next step up. She also ran some bloodwork which I am waiting to hear back on.

After increasing my meds, I do feel better but the intrusive thoughts are still running through my head. I’m tired of being a damn hypochondriac. I am a grown ass woman and I should have my mental shit under control but god I feel so alone.

Anxiety,1hbsw0m,Just wanting to get a 'gut check' or am I projecting due to my own mental health? Discussion about ageing family members ,"Am I being ageist about a flight of stairs? 

Ok background: my aunt-in-law is in her 70s, mobility issues (mainly fibromyalgia in feet), and severe depression (just as background).  My in-laws (who I love and have become my parental units showing actual love for the past 30 years) are coming to visit and we have a finished basement she has slept in while visiting in the past 4 years. 

2 years ago, by the time she got upstairs, she was breathing heavily and had to sit to catch her breath.  She has slipped on the carpeted stairs in the past - which hurt her knee and I'm sure was in more pain than letting on.

But with her depression, she really likes to be in the dark, quiet basement.

Last year we went to visit at her house. 

So this year, (I talked my in-laws into a hotel we are paying for and aunt in law can stay at our house). I said her being in the basement and the stairs really stress me out because I'm worried she's going to fall again and we won't be able to tell because there's a door that closes to the stairs. 

I requested that she use our smaller guest room on the main floor (I put up black out curtains to make it nice and dark) and while she doesn't directly tell me she'd rather stay in the basement, I know she prefers it down there.

I can't tell if I'm being ageist?  Hubby agrees with me, but just wanting to get a 'gut check'.

Anxiety,1h6v0r9,New Research linking leaded gas to mental health for Gen X.,"I just saw an article in USA Today about the effects of leaded gasoline on people in my age group.

Anxiety,1gw9rw3,What do I do about my mental health?,"This could be triggering to some people.

I need to dump this somewhere because I can't manage to tell anyone I know and I'm scared that this is going to kill me eventually.

At the beginning of the year I had my two best friends, one of which I had a really big crush on. In March I told them both that I had severe anxiety and depression with multiple severe suicidal ideations a day. At first they were concerned and comforted me, but as the year has gone things have changed. The my friend whom I had a crush on cut off ties with me and never wanted to directly talk to me, rather she would tell my other friend who would then tell me, her justification was that she wanted to preserve her own mental health. My other friend now doesn't even open my messages for days or a week at a time and anytime I ask if I've done something he tells me I'm over thinking and need to stop. Anytime I tell him about my feelings he downplays them, even when I had scars down my arm from self harminghe said that they were just ""silly ideas"" and for me the only reason he tried to stop me was because he would feel responsible if I died, not because he wanted me alive. Both my friends have said that I should go to a psych ward, even the girl who hasn't even been there to see me in over 8 months.

Both are far more popular and liked than me, meaning I can't tell anyone out of fear that they will side with my friends and say that it's my fault, hell, the girl even has an Instagram account with 171k followers who all think she's one of the Greatest people ever. I don't know what to do. We've all graduated, and now I'm just empty on the inside. I got better throughout the year with my mental health but now I feel like I'm regressing, therapy isn't helping and I'm scared that I will kill myself. The main thing stopping me is that I don't want people to feel responsible, not even my two friends despite what they have done. I know that I've not experienced anything close to as bad as others on this page, but I'm just not sure and I'm scared.

Anxiety,1gthz30,Bad health anxiety,"Hey guys any advice on how to deal with health anxiety?
I have dealt with minor health anxiety for years,but always seemed to get on with life.
After myself and my girlfriend split up for a while we both decided to get a STD test when we got back together because he had been with other people.
When I done the test it tested for every std still it was an online test you do at home and send off in the mail.
I done the test and got a call about two weeks later saying everything came back clear apart from my HIV test that came back “Low reactive”.
The doctor on the phone re assured me this happened all the time and is more then likely reacting to Covid or something else in my blood as stupid as even antihistamines.
I got sent to the hospital for further testing and was told all is negative and I have nothing to worry about.
Those few weeks waiting around were really the worst of my life and the stress really got to me,even now since I know I don’t have it I still deal with the stress of “what if “ and really put myself into dark places every single day about that test.
Since then I have been a mess,it’s been nearly two years .
I have diagnosed myself with nearly every terminal you can think of since then,every day and every second of my day is consumed of thoughts of dying and new diagnoses
I am doing counselling the past few months as I really felt like something had to be done as I cannot live life this and the dark thoughts have really made my life hell even to the point I can barely work anymore or barely get out of bed.i even ended up in the ER a couple of times due to stress taking a toll on me giving me chest tightness etc and the doctors.
Even though my counsellor is so good and really cares I find myself always going back to the HIV false positive test.
These days I feel like it’s never going to end,I’m doing all the right things and I still feel run down,mentally not here as if I’m in a dream,cannot think straight,exhausted ,no drive to do anything other than think of death.
I have even gotten very bad eye floaters and visual snow from the stress and that does not help what so ever.
The physical symptoms of feeling down and depressed have even made my health anxiety worse as I’m saying to myself “there must be something wrong with me” even though I know deep down it’s just mental health and not physical health.
I don’t think any of my close friends or family really know how bad I have it as I have put on a strong face going through everything to not worry anyone.
Has anyone any suggestions on what I could do to maybe help myself get better.

Anxiety,1fz8wt4,Severe anxiety about another pandemic/lockdown due to my international relationship and how severely covid impacted my mental health overall,"Hello. I'm sorry if I post a lot (i am a very anxious person). I have been seeing a lot on the news and social media and such as well as hearing from family members (some who would be considered conspiracy theorists but some who wouldn't) that we are inevitably heading for another global pandemic/lockdown whether it be a resurgence of Covid, mpox, or something altogether different. This gives me extreme anxiety. During the covid lockdowns, I was extremely anxious and depressed to the point I didn't want to keep going. Not only that, but I'm Canadian and my significant other is American. I am extremely scared that the borders will close and we will be separated for over a year again. I was barely able to handle it the first time and we hadn't met in person at that point (so I know this would be a million times harder). I would love some advice/insight. Are others worrying about this? Do most people think this is a real possibility? Is it thought that if a pandemic happened and even if individual countries didn't lock down, the border would automaticall/inevitably close? That's what I've been told by some people. I'm sorry this is just really weighing me down and I need some perspective and if it is a real big possibility some advice on how to deal with it. Thank you so much!!

Anxiety,1fql4je,Health Anxiety (HIV),"Hey everyone. I've been going through some of the worst anxiety of my life and I wanted to share so, maybe my experience could help someone going through a similar thing. 

I (23 F) have been diagnosed with OCD 3 years ago but I've had it for as long as I could remember. When I was 10, I was convinced I had a brain tumour and only 2 months to live and even convinced myself I had double vision because I heard that is one of the symptoms. When I was 12 I was convinced my great uncle died because I didn't tie my shoe laces in a specific way and the guilt I felt for ''killing my grandma's brother'' was insane to bear. I had a milion other fears and never sought help because I was afraid everyone would think I was a horrible person. Well......at 20 I found the courage to google my fears and realised it was OCD. Soon after I got diagnosed and prescribed Zoloft. Another few months go by and I met a guy who also had OCD and finally for the first time in my life someone understood. We clicked on so many levels and it was one of those relationships that is simply meant to be. Fast forward to 3 years later and he breaks up with me. I was already pretty weak physically and mentally because I had been going through an intense time at university with my exams, drank way too much Redbull and lost a lot of weight. This broke me. I couldn't eat for days and completely fell apart. With the help of my family and friends I started to feel a bit better but I still hated the fact that I couldn't find anyone else attractive. I wanted to not care about him the way he doesn't care about me anymore. I went out, met a man and we went to his place. We used protection but it got stuck inside me at some point so, the sex was unprotected for a few minutes. We replaced the condom with a new one and everything was okay after that. Until the next day........I start FREAKING OUT ''What if he has HIV???"". I googled the symptoms, researched all the window periods of when I could get tested, should I get PEP? - I called emergency gynecology service and described the situation: ""The condom slipped and he seemed healthy but I don't know him and what if he gave me HIV, do I need PEP??"". The doctor assured me that the odds are so extremely low that nobody in their right mind would prescribe me PEP for such ''exposure''. The anxiety was so unbearable I even told my mum, sister, stepdad, pretty much every friend I have and even some of my sister's friends. It was bad. I was annoying and looked for reassurance anywhere and everywhere I could. When everyone got tired of me I got so desperate that I started texting with ChatGPT to assure me how low the odds are and that everything I'm experiencing is anxiety. For these tests there is a waiting period and there is nothing you can do in these few weeks/months (depending on the type of the test). I went for a check up at my gynecologist and explained the situation. She said: ''We can test you for gonorrhea and clamidia. For HPV it's too early and concerning your worries about HIV.........we don't do that here, it's so rare, especially in women that nobody checks for it unless the risk is real which in your case it isn't so, if you really want to, you could go to a testing centre and do it there''. But still it was too early to test. I Googled HIV for hours every day, I read every story on Reddit, Quora, watched every YouTube video and then in between I would take a break to have a panic attack. This was my last summer as a student where I don't need to stress about looking for a job and I completely blew it. I was supposed to visit my friends and relatives but all I could do is cry and hyperventilate. I had a 3 day long cold in this time but it was after walking underdressed in the rain and everyone in my family got sick and had it worse than me. Other than that I was perfectly physically healthy. The odds of this man having HIV + not knowing he had it (because U=U, he should've been untreated with a high viral load) + transmitting it with such brief exposure + me being in the ~30% of people who do not develop an acute HIV reaction are 1 in a 127 milion. To put it into perspective, there's a higher likelihood of me getting struck by lightning and winning a lottery than getting HIV from this encounter. But still.......I wanted the odds to be 0. Finally I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, severely depressed, having panic attacks every day, losing weight from all the stress. The health anxiety was so unbearable and caused me to feel in ways I never thought I would. I just wanted to die, I couldn't deal with this anymore. Finally, I went to the testing centre with my sister. The doctor there asked me a few questions. Again, told me the risk is almost 0 and that it's good I'm doing it just for a piece of mind. She also told me the amount of time that passed since the exposure is perfect for this kind of test. I had my blood taken and had to wait to get the results by email within a week. This morning finally I get the results. Negative. 
I feel like I can finally move on with my life again. Already I can feel OCD trying to creep in with ''what if that's someone elses result'' ''what if even though she said the window period is perfect , you should do it again''. I'm not giving in again. This cost me weeks of my life and I refuse to pay any more attention onto this useless 1 in a 127 million chance. A normal person (at least where I live) wouldn't even test if something like this had happened.

Anyways, I would like to share what I thought was helpful for someone going through this now. First of all, I'm sorry you're going through this. I know we are overreacting but I also know how unbearable it feels. Hold on and test, and just like me and countless other hypochondriacs out there, you will be fine. At least physically 🥲.
The best advice I could give you is don't Google, don't give in to reassurence, keep busy and practice CBT............I wasn't doing this. I behaved like a little reassurance addict looking for a fix every few minutes. So, if you will not take the best approach, these are other good ways to cope: 
There's this YouTuber ''Leigh'', she's HIV+ and had a playlist full of videos of people freaking out about HIV from low risk situations, almost killing themselves in some cases and then testing and being negative. Also her entire channel is great and helped me and a bunch of people like me so, I highly recommend. Another thing is looking into videos about health anxiety and contamination OCD. This helped me start seeing it for what this was; A psychological problem, not an epidemiological one. Also look at your life situation; What happened? - I found a few important factors that lead to this when I analysed it a bit:

- I have OCD and have had health anxiety on and of since I was a child.
- I slept with another man way too soon after the break up. What really broke me is the fact that the whole time I wanted him to be my ex. I wanted my ex to care. I felt alone and abandoned. Especially because he also had OCD, for the first time after 3 years I was misunderstood again. And it hurt like hell. So, most likely my brain fixated on a fear of the virus which felt like I had something to solve (even though I didn't), instead of dealing with the pain that the person I love most doesn't love me anymore. 
- Because I felt abandoned, I wanted to ''win'' the break up. I wanted to be the best version of myself. I wanted him to regret losing me because of how amazing I'm doing. For someone with health anxiety, getting diagnosed with HIV would arguably interfere with my plan and that was my core fear. That is why I fixated on HIV and not clamidia or syphilis or something that can be cured with a round of antibiotics. 
- I was already weak mentally and physically because of stress at university, rapid weight loss, not eating and the break up. 
- I was so sure me and my ex would be together forever. When he started breaking up with me I thought he was joking for a good few minutes because of how incredibly unlikely I thought that was. Therefore the uncertainty; If something that I was so sure would never happen, then the 1 in a 127 milion chance of me getting HIV might also happen! Because I was so shocked by his decision, my mind subconsciously wanted to protect me and take control over uncertainty, preparing me for the worst and least likely outcome. 

These irrational HIV freak outs from super low risk situations are often fuelled by shame and guilt. So what really helped is looking at where this is coming from and treating it as a psychological issue. I know you feel like it's the end of the world right now but keep going. You will have the test done and you will be okay. I know this post is super long but if I can help just one person going through this, I'll be happy. Just keep going, you've got this!!",8,2,hey everyone i've been going through some of the worst anxiety of my life and i wanted to share so maybe my experience could help someone going through a similar thing i f have been diagnosed with ocd years ago but i've had it for as long as i could remember when i was i was convinced i had a brain tumour and only months to live and even convinced myself i had double vision because i heard that is one of the symptoms when i was i was convinced my great uncle died because i didn't tie my shoe laces in a specific way and the guilt i felt for ''killing my grandma's brother'' was insane to bear i had a milion other fears and never sought help because i was afraid everyone would think i was a horrible person well at i found the courage to google my fears and realised it was ocd soon after i got diagnosed and prescribed zoloft another few months go by and i met a guy who also had ocd and finally for the first time in my life someone understood we clicked on so many levels and it was one of those relationships that is simply meant to be fast forward to years later and he breaks up with me i was already pretty weak physically and mentally because i had been going through an intense time at university with my exams drank way too much redbull and lost a lot of weight this broke me i couldn't eat for days and completely fell apart with the help of my family and friends i started to feel a bit better but i still hated the fact that i couldn't find anyone else attractive i wanted to not care about him the way he doesn't care about me anymore i went out met a man and we went to his place we used protection but it got stuck inside me at some point so the sex was unprotected for a few minutes we replaced the condom with a new one and everything was okay after that until the next day i start freaking out ''what if he has hiv i googled the symptoms researched all the window periods of when i could get tested should i get pep i called emergency gynecology service and described the situation the condom slipped and he seemed healthy but i don't know him and what if he gave me hiv do i need pep the doctor assured me that the odds are so extremely low that nobody in their right mind would prescribe me pep for such ''exposure'' the anxiety was so unbearable i even told my mum sister stepdad pretty much every friend i have and even some of my sister's friends it was bad i was annoying and looked for reassurance anywhere and everywhere i could when everyone got tired of me i got so desperate that i started texting with chatgpt to assure me how low the odds are and that everything i'm experiencing is anxiety for these tests there is a waiting period and there is nothing you can do in these few weeks months depending on the type of the test i went for a check up at my gynecologist and explained the situation she said ''we can test you for gonorrhea and clamidia for hpv it's too early and concerning your worries about hiv we don't do that here it's so rare especially in women that nobody checks for it unless the risk is real which in your case it isn't so if you really want to you could go to a testing centre and do it there'' but still it was too early to test i googled hiv for hours every day i read every story on reddit quora watched every youtube video and then in between i would take a break to have a panic attack this was my last summer as a student where i don't need to stress about looking for a job and i completely blew it i was supposed to visit my friends and relatives but all i could do is cry and hyperventilate i had a day long cold in this time but it was after walking underdressed in the rain and everyone in my family got sick and had it worse than me other than that i was perfectly physically healthy the odds of this man having hiv not knowing he had it because u u he should've been untreated with a high viral load transmitting it with such brief exposure me being in the of people who do not develop an acute hiv reaction are in a milion to put it into perspective there's a higher likelihood of me getting struck by lightning and winning a lottery than getting hiv from this encounter but still i wanted the odds to be finally i couldn't do it anymore i was suicidal severely depressed having panic attacks every day losing weight from all the stress the health anxiety was so unbearable and caused me to feel in ways i never thought i would i just wanted to die i couldn't deal with this anymore finally i went to the testing centre with my sister the doctor there asked me a few questions again told me the risk is almost and that it's good i'm doing it just for a piece of mind she also told me the amount of time that passed since the exposure is perfect for this kind of test i had my blood taken and had to wait to get the results by email within a week this morning finally i get the results negative i feel like i can finally move on with my life again already i can feel ocd trying to creep in with ''what if that's someone elses result'' ''what if even though she said the window period is perfect you should do it again'' i'm not giving in again this cost me weeks of my life and i refuse to pay any more attention onto this useless in a million chance a normal person at least where i live wouldn't even test if something like this had happened anyways i would like to share what i thought was helpful for someone going through this now first of all i'm sorry you're going through this i know we are overreacting but i also know how unbearable it feels hold on and test and just like me and countless other hypochondriacs out there you will be fine at least physically the best advice i could give you is don't google don't give in to reassurence keep busy and practice cbt i wasn't doing this i behaved like a little reassurance addict looking for a fix every few minutes so if you will not take the best approach these are other good ways to cope there's this youtuber ''leigh'' she's hiv and had a playlist full of videos of people freaking out about hiv from low risk situations almost killing themselves in some cases and then testing and being negative also her entire channel is great and helped me and a bunch of people like me so i highly recommend another thing is looking into videos about health anxiety and contamination ocd this helped me start seeing it for what this was a psychological problem not an epidemiological one also look at your life situation what happened i found a few important factors that lead to this when i analysed it a bit i have ocd and have had health anxiety on and of since i was a child i slept with another man way too soon after the break up what really broke me is the fact that the whole time i wanted him to be my ex i wanted my ex to care i felt alone and abandoned especially because he also had ocd for the first time after years i was misunderstood again and it hurt like hell so most likely my brain fixated on a fear of the virus which felt like i had something to solve even though i didn't instead of dealing with the pain that the person i love most doesn't love me anymore because i felt abandoned i wanted to ''win'' the break up i wanted to be the best version of myself i wanted him to regret losing me because of how amazing i'm doing for someone with health anxiety getting diagnosed with hiv would arguably interfere with my plan and that was my core fear that is why i fixated on hiv and not clamidia or syphilis or something that can be cured with a round of antibiotics i was already weak mentally and physically because of stress at university rapid weight loss not eating and the break up i was so sure me and my ex would be together forever when he started breaking up with me i thought he was joking for a good few minutes because of how incredibly unlikely i thought that was therefore the uncertainty if something that i was so sure would never happen then the in a milion chance of me getting hiv might also happen because i was so shocked by his decision my mind subconsciously wanted to protect me and take control over uncertainty preparing me for the worst and least likely outcome these irrational hiv freak outs from super low risk situations are often fuelled by shame and guilt so what really helped is looking at where this is coming from and treating it as a psychological issue i know you feel like it's the end of the world right now but keep going you will have the test done and you will be okay i know this post is

Ever since then I have noticed that my health anxiety has came back. My health anxiety started 2 years ago when I got pretty ill and had to stay a couple of days in the hospital. Things got better after 6 months of therapy and my physical health issues were also under control.

I don’t think it is the idea of dying that I am afraid of. It is the that I won’t be able to see my kids grow up.

Anxiety,18mz0bj,Crippling health anxiety out of the blue,"I am a female in my early 40's with severe health anxiety that came on recently. Since the beginning of November, I have had crushing fatigue, joint aches that come and go, sinus pressure and headaches, and on/off lightheadedness. Symptoms get worse after physical or mental exertion. Also get worse the more I think I am dying of a million diseases, checking my blood pressure, oxygen, etc. which are always normal. I have not looked up health issues for about 10 years. I checked about 15 diseases daily now and also think I have diseases other people have. I check my pulse oximeter multiple times a day (usually around 97-100). Blood pressure around 115/75. Temp always normal range. 

Been to urgent care and PCP many times. First diagnosed as sinus infection (I had dizziness and post nasal drip), took antibiotics, then crushing fatigue started. Currently taking probiotics, multi, and activated charcoal.

Doctors ran a whole blood panel as they wanted to check thyroid and iron levels. All that was fine and so were my cholesterol, A1C, white and red blood cell count, and everything else within normal range. They diagnosed me as having anxiety disorder. Can all this happen out of the blue? What else can I do? Tried yoga and meditation - it only works temporarily. I am already a fanatically health eater and used to be a half marathon runner until I got sick. Now I can barely take a walk outside within getting tired. I work from home on the computer but have given up work since this happened. Fortunately, my sig. other has a 6 figure income.

How it all started:

Moved to a new state 6 months ago. Was doing fine - working from home, exercising regularly, eating healthy, going out every weekend, taking trips, doing yoga. Did not have any worries or anxiety about anything. I wasn't stressed either as my job is easy and I take multiple breaks. I am not the type of person who has social anxiety or fears going out in public. 

Fast forward 6 months. My husband has an out-of-the-blue seizure. Ran dozens of test and couldn't find anything wrong. No Covid, no infection. He was the sole driver in our family. I am totally afraid to drive - I had to pick it up in a week to drive us around which gave me some anxiety. I was doing fine for about a month. Also looked up anything that could cause a seizure - vitamin deficiency, etc. and started taking and doing different things so I didn't have one too. My biggest fear is fainting in public. I started worrying about being deficient in b12, D, and b6 (since had both checked and they were fine), electrolyte imbalance, blood pressure being low, sleep apnea, etc. Had nightmare about him having seizures and also about myself possibly having one. Have no family in the area so it is scarier if something happens as we are on our own.

A few days before my period started in early November, I started getting major PMS symptoms. I have not had bad PMS symptoms in years. Bad headache, fatigue, heavy feeling in legs, extreme dizziness. About a week later, I went to the doctor and was diagnosed as having a sinus infection/possible allergies. Never really had a problem before except a mold allergy which typically doesn't give me many issues. I was completely couch bound for 3 weeks while on antibiotics and for the next week. Took probiotics the entire time. Husband had to cook and clean which stressed him out more and stressed me out that I was making him do it.

I thought I would be better after the antibiotics but I have insane fatigue. I can now do chores around the house and maybe walk around the lake around our apartment (although I still get nervous and heavy headed), but definitely can not go out in public or work. I continue to do yoga, meditation, eat healthy, take vitamins, try not to worry, but nothing works. I thought the cleared medical panel would provide relief but it didn't. 

I was so happy before this happened. I was doing well on my job, running daily, etc. Now I feel like a loser that can't do anything. The more I am tired/can't do anything, the more anxious I get. So it has been a never ending battle since the second week of November. I feel better when I am healthy as my health is tied to my anxiety. I have been healthy for the past 10 years or so, so maybe my anxiety was dormant until my husband's weird medical problem. Weird medical issues freak me out the most. At the same time,  his mom was diagnosed with a rare infection, then cancer. Also my grandma has been in out and out of the hospital with weird diseases and my brother was also having undiagnosed issues. All these together have made me a mess.

First off, I have always been a bit of a hypochondriac and worrier although it has gotten better in the last 10-15 years. My health anxiety is usually tied to have financial problems or hearing about other people's major health problems. Fortunately, my entire family has been pretty much healthy the past decade and my husband and I have had few financial problems. I tended to freak over health problems more in our college years/early professional years. Also as a child, my family had financial problems so I was a constant worrier. 

The doctors don't seem to say much even about the anxiety. Just asking what I do to relax. I am definitely not depressed and I am only anxious about being tired and having to give about my running, my job, and my life. 

Any suggestions? Anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do? How can I wake up feeling not tired and ready to live the same way I did 2 months ago?

Dpdr is here again, and im afraid of permanency and the symptoms of anxiety and depression (like Im not gonna be better, i will be like this forever, none of the meds or therapy will be working for me, im afraid about suicide even if im not considering it at all, afraid of other mental illnesses…etc) Now i take duloxetine, and im feeling myself a little better but not 100%.

Anxiety,1euy0ek,Anxiety or health issue??,"Back in April, I had an extreme mental breakdown (as I do every few years) and usually after a few weeks/months of depression and anxiety I slowly go back to normal. However this time things have really gotten worse. Shortly after the anxiety started I noticed I was getting headaches and severe dizziness. Not just panic attack dizziness but it lasted all day every day. I went to the doctor and they told me I had a severe sinus infection and an allergic reaction to something unknown. I was treated but had to go back because the infection never went away. After the second round of antibiotics I felt much better and finally like myself again. I am taking Allegra every day, and Flonase twice a day, along with my antidepressant/ I’ve been on for years. During this time I really stressed about my driving because the dizziness and brain fog made it hard to concentrate on the road. I recently went on vacation where I had to drive a long way to my destination. I started out fine but then became so paranoid and anxious about suddenly becoming dizzy that’s exactly what happened! I hate anxiety. My vacation was a mess, I was so overwhelmed, I woke up one morning with a slight headache, and was so dizzy I couldn’t walk straight. It felt like I had woken up incredibly drunk. Possibly a vestibular migraine from being so anxious? It was terrifying. It made me so upset we had to go home early. The dizziness lasted several days, and I feel much better now, however I am so exhausted every day and I still feel as though my brain fog makes it really hard to focus and be present. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I have a hard time differentiating if my symptoms are truly caused by a health issue or if my body is so incredibly stressed that it begins to react physically.

Anxiety,1efs36z,Crazy Anxiety Symptoms/Health and Symptomatic Anxiety,"Hello everyone,

Please read until the end because this is very crazy and scary, and I am kind of confused about what is happening. This is a longer story because there are many factors affecting my current health and mental state, but I won't talk about all of that right now.

So let's start. I have OCD and health anxiety, which I developed because of chronic pains under my left rib cage in my abdomen. These pains have been unexplained by doctors for years, severely decreasing my quality of life. In addition to that, I also have daily headaches, constant fatigue, muscle weakness, and I always feel sleepy. Since February this year, I've been experiencing dizziness and other neurological symptoms like visual auras and unexplained physical discomfort in my body. This is when I started connecting the dots and began thinking I might have a more serious problem like a tumor or multiple sclerosis.

I tried to convince myself that I was probably just overreacting, but four weeks ago, I had a strong panic attack that felt like a seizure. It felt like a brain stroke with severe dizziness, trouble thinking, mental decline, and severe anxiety. I thought my panic attacks had returned, so I assured myself that there was nothing serious going on. But then the scary part came. After the panic attack, something physically changed in my body. I felt shifted, disoriented, and my body felt twisted. My center of gravity shifted to one side, causing trouble walking because I felt like something was pulling me to the left side, and my left leg felt shorter. This affected my balance, but that wasn't the worst part.

Four days after the initial panic attack, I experienced sudden weakness in my right arm, which lasted for an hour, and then I had another panic attack that sent me to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke. The weakness in one arm shifted to a weird, disturbing feeling of weakness in my entire right side. This new symptom was terrifying and unlike any panic attack I had experienced before, making me more concerned.

At the ER, they told me it was just a panic attack and that I didn't have to worry about anything. I was devastated, constantly thinking about brain strokes and tumors. I was convinced that I had one of those conditions because I had all the symptoms. I even used ChatGPT to evaluate my health based on my symptoms, and it suggested a tumor, brain stroke, or multiple sclerosis. This devastated me so much that I mentally broke down and lost track of my past, present, and future. It was the lowest point in my life, and I can't even describe the feelings I had.

I started visiting doctors every day and underwent numerous tests like MRI, CT scans, blood work, and more, but everything came back clear. I felt a little relieved to find out I didn't have a tumor or stroke, but there's still one more possibility that is hard to rule out: multiple sclerosis. I'm waiting for my blood test results for that.

I didn't share all the details here because it would make this post much longer, but some details are brutal. The worst thing is that my OCD is spiraling my mind, and I can't escape the bad thoughts and ideas, which led me to a psychiatry appointment. It caused a total identity breakdown, severe prolonged DPDR (depersonalization/derealization), severe anxiety, and eventually severe depression. It's been five weeks of feeling this way, and while my mental and health state is improving, a few symptoms still bother me the most: trouble walking due to balance issues, half of my body feels misaligned, half of my face feels weird like it's not placed properly, and I have this disturbing feeling around my eye, creating an illusion of a vision problem.

These symptoms are fluctuating and persistent. If anyone has experienced something similar, please help me out. If any of you are going through the same problems, we can create a group to support each other. Just let me know. I'm not usually the type of person to write stuff on Reddit, but I just want to live a normal life and improve my quality of life because I'm exhausted, and time is passing quickly. We're getting older, and we shouldn't have these kinds of problems in our youth.",1,3,hello everyone please read until the end because this is very crazy and scary and i am kind of confused about what is happening this is a longer story because there are many factors affecting my current health and mental state but i won't talk about all of that right now so let's start i have ocd and health anxiety which i developed because of chronic pains under my left rib cage in my abdomen these pains have been unexplained by doctors for years severely decreasing my quality of life in addition to that i also have daily headaches constant fatigue muscle weakness and i always feel sleepy since february this year i've been experiencing dizziness and other neurological symptoms like visual auras and unexplained physical discomfort in my body this is when i started connecting the dots and began thinking i might have a more serious problem like a tumor or multiple sclerosis i tried to convince myself that i was probably just overreacting but four weeks ago i had a strong panic attack that felt like a seizure it felt like a brain stroke with severe dizziness trouble thinking mental decline and severe anxiety i thought my panic attacks had returned so i assured myself that there was nothing serious going on but then the scary part came after the panic attack something physically changed in my body i felt shifted disoriented and my body felt twisted my center of gravity shifted to one side causing trouble walking because i felt like something was pulling me to the left side and my left leg felt shorter this affected my balance but that wasn't the worst part four days after the initial panic attack i experienced sudden weakness in my right arm which lasted for an hour and then i had another panic attack that sent me to the er because i thought i was having a stroke the weakness in one arm shifted to a weird disturbing feeling of weakness in my entire right side this new symptom was terrifying and unlike any panic attack i had experienced before making me more concerned at the er they told me it was just a panic attack and that i didn't have to worry about anything i was devastated constantly thinking about brain strokes and tumors i was convinced that i had one of those conditions because i had all the symptoms i even used chatgpt to evaluate my health based on my symptoms and it suggested a tumor brain stroke or multiple sclerosis this devastated me so much that i mentally broke down and lost track of my past present and future it was the lowest point in my life and i can't even describe the feelings i had i started visiting doctors every day and underwent numerous tests like mri ct scans blood work and more but everything came back clear i felt a little relieved to find out i didn't have a tumor or stroke but there's still one more possibility that is hard to rule out multiple sclerosis i'm waiting for my blood test results for that i didn't share all the details here because it would make this post much longer but some details are brutal the worst thing is that my ocd is spiraling my mind and i can't escape the bad thoughts and ideas which led me to a psychiatry appointment it caused a total identity breakdown severe prolonged dpdr depersonalization derealization severe anxiety and eventually severe depression it's been five weeks of feeling this way and while my mental and health state is improving a few symptoms still bother me the most trouble walking due to balance issues half of my body feels misaligned half of my face feels weird like it's not placed properly and i have this disturbing feeling around my eye creating an illusion of a vision problem these symptoms are fluctuating and persistent if anyone has experienced something similar please help me out if any of you are going through the same problems we can create a group to support each other just let me know i'm not usually the type of person to write stuff on reddit but i just want to live a normal life and improve my quality of life because i'm exhausted and time is passing quickly we're getting older and we shouldn't have these kinds of problems in our youth,-0.05148845598845601,-0.9993,NEGATIVE,0.9979580640792847,negative,negative,negative

Anxiety,1ffqvku,Seeking Advice: Struggling with Mental Health Issues,"Hey everyone,

I'm new to reddit and I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm having some really tough mental health issues and I'm not sure what's causing them. I've recently dropped out of college because they were making it impossible for me to focus.

I'm a 20-year-old man and I've been experiencing a mix of symptoms, including:

 - Mild agoraphobia (Increased anxiety in crowds or when walking on the street)

 - Mild aquaphobia (causing problems with personal hygiene)

 - Loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy

 - Difficulty learning new things

 - Family history of psychological problems (unspecified)

 - Sensitivity to sunlight

 - Irritability

 - Occasional severe depression

 - Difficulty remembering new faces

 - Emotional distress when talking about to or my father

 - Feeling hopeless

 - Trouble reading long texts or code

 - Anxiety

 - Lethargy (trouble getting myself up to do anything or moving from one activity to another, especially when it's not scheduled in advance. eg: takes me about an hour to get out of bed after waking up)

 - Frequent fatigue

 - Cravings

 - Social withdrawal

 - Weight gain (20kg/44lb in 2 years)

 - Concentration issues

 - Inferiority complex

 - Nausea and balance problems

 - Travel anxiety (nausea, headaches, nosebleeds)

 - Insomnia

 - Increased body fat

 - Low stamina

 - Hyperventilation

 - Difficulty with chores

 - Trouble making new friends

 - Joint pain

 - Difficulty concentrating especially when going to the bathroom (bowel movements)

 - Hot flashes

 - Short-term memory loss

 - Stuttering

 - High stress levels

 - Snoring

 - Feeling strange sensations in my head (blood vessels heating up and itching)

 - Nausea when adrenaline levels rise

 - Increased skin sensitivity to pain

 - Feeling overwhelmed when watching sad movie scenes

 - Able to predict my worst days (usually a 30-day interval)

 - Can confirm that it's not autism, hyperthyroidism, adhd, or cancer (from previous medical tests)



These symptoms have been going on for 4 years, and they've been gradually getting worse. I've seen three psychiatrists who haven't been able to identify the problem. I was prescribed Prozac for 3 months, but it didn't help.



I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed and isolated. I'm looking for advice or support from anyone who might have similar experiences or who can point me in the right direction.



Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Anxiety,18bvszu,The mental health industry is a joke,"I saw a new primary care doctor the other day because my hand has been hurting for months. Instead of addressing my pain, doc went on about my anxiety/depression for an hour and a half.

I guess she could see in my records that my psychiatrist prescribed me xanax + propranolol, and she thinks I shouldn’t take them and that I should be on an ssri. I explained that I’ve been on an ssri before and it did me more harm than good. Also, I don’t take my other meds bc propranolol has zero effect on me, and I’ve never even tried the xanax because I’m too scared. I told her that I wanted to start therapy before I made another decision regarding medication and she said that she’s pretty sure my anxiety is genetics, so while therapy might help, I’ll probably have to take meds my whole life. 

This lady wouldn’t let me get a word in. And every time I repeated why I don’t want to get on another ssri, she would just explain again why I should— “You deserve to be happy 🥺”

I don’t want to be happy. I just want to be able to function like a normal person in society. 

I ended up leaving with a Zoloft prescription and hand pain bc she never even looked at my hand, and I was so overwhelmed that I forgot what I even went there for.

My psychiatrist is the same. I was initially open to trying out medication, but now that I’ve tried it, I’ve changed my mind. Why is that so bad? Last time I saw my psychiatrist, she kept offering me more drugs. I refused multiple times and explained why I didn’t want them and she literally crossed her arms and patronizingly said “well what do you want to do then”

THERAPY.

I’ve been trying to get a therapist for four months now and she knows that. She been stalling referring me to someone, and now she’s saying that I should find one myself.

I’ve tried psychology today, zocdoc, getting referred, google search. I’ve called so many people and nothing. My options are already so limited, but on top of that, half of them are closing down their locations near where I live? (so I would have to drive 2 hours to another location) and the other half exclusively do telehealth. I live with my nosy family, so that’s not an option.

It’s literally impossible for me to find a therapist, but everyone and their mother wants to give me meds. They hand them out like tic tacs. 

This past month alone has been frustrating enough that I’ve forgotten to be anxious and depressed. Maybe that was their plan all along

Someone please tell me that doing exposure therapy on my own will help my social anxiety/panic attacks bc I literally feel like I’m going to have to fix me myself.",31,10,i saw a new primary care doctor the other day because my hand has been hurting for months instead of addressing my pain doc went on about my anxiety depression for an hour and a half i guess she could see in my records that my psychiatrist prescribed me xanax propranolol and she thinks i shouldn t take them and that i should be on an ssri i explained that i ve been on an ssri before and it did me more harm than good also i don t take my other meds bc propranolol has zero effect on me and i ve never even tried the xanax because i m too scared i told her that i wanted to start therapy before i made another decision regarding medication and she said that she s pretty sure my anxiety is genetics so while therapy might help i ll probably have to take meds my whole life this lady wouldn t let me get a word in and every time i repeated why i don t want to get on another ssri she would just explain again why i should you deserve to be happy i don t want to be happy i just want to be able to function like a normal person in society i ended up leaving with a zoloft prescription and hand pain bc she never even looked at my hand and i was so overwhelmed that i forgot what i even went there for my psychiatrist is the same i was initially open to trying out medication but now that i ve tried it i ve changed my mind why is that so bad last time i saw my psychiatrist she kept offering me more drugs i refused multiple times and explained why i didn t want them and she literally crossed her arms and patronizingly said well what do you want to do then therapy i ve been trying to get a therapist for four months now and she knows that she been stalling referring me to someone and now she s saying that i should find one myself i ve tried psychology today zocdoc getting referred google search i ve called so many people and nothing my options are already so limited but on top of that half of them are closing down their locations near where i live so i would have to drive hours to another location and the other half exclusively do telehealth i live with my nosy family so that s not an option it s literally impossible for me to find a therapist but everyone and their mother wants to give me meds they hand them out like tic tacs this past month alone has been frustrating enough that i ve forgotten to be anxious and depressed maybe that was their plan all along someone please tell me that doing exposure therapy on my own will help my social anxiety panic attacks bc i literally feel like i m going to have to fix me myself,0.1124677223361434,-0.9021,NEGATIVE,0.999350368976593,positive,negative,negative
Anxiety,1ctkh5m,My mental health is being ruined day by day and I want to kms,"I '16F' am in senior year of highschool. I've been depressed for years and was finally diagnosed with depression anxiety and insomnia a month ago. I just want to go somewhere without anyone knowing.
How do I let go of the past and heal myself?

 My relationship with the people in school is terrible I'm not sure where to start but I'll keep it short. For starters this began during my middle school (2019), the boys mostly flirt or have a crush on me because they think I'm pretty/beautiful but I've always been insecure and all those guys are bad toxic rumour creating people. I do well in my studies and come in the top 3 ranks and I'm not sure but the girls seem to be my friend but always end up holding a grudge against me due to this I hated everybody from school and became completely silent during lockdown(2020-2021) when school reopened(2022) as normal I was extremely anxious would always be scared to read in front of the class etc and during sophomore year(2023-2024) I had no one to talk to even a word I couldn't focus nor concentrate even during exams as day goes on I'm afraid of everything. 

My relationship at home is not good either. me, my mom, my brother, my step dad and my grandpa live in a 3 bedroom house so the space is pretty cramped and I don't have any freedom. I dont like my step dad as he's been toxic during our childhood but nows he's changed a lot but still I don't think I could forgive him. My brother(18M) is always absent, never at home never helps around the house or even takes me to shops for grocery or stationery. My granpa is the egoistic kind you would see who thinks they're right in everything. I pity my mom who has to put up with all this. All three of these males don't help with chores and so only me and my mom have to do them. My mom is the breadwinner of the house and my dad does not work domue to health reasons. In this summer break I've left house like 10 times and I'm going insane. I have no friends to go out or talk to otmr play with I'm very much all alone. 

My brain cannot deal with this even thought its been like this for years.I don't like to eat I don't want to eat I don't love the stuffs I used to nor do I do my creative crafts anymore . I'm lost. I forget everything I'm scared :( . Harming myself give me joy I see blood and for once I feel something which I know is very wrong but otherwise I feel nothing.

Anxiety,1bod922,Need help or advice on mental health.. urgently,"26M here. Please bear with me, its my first time using Reddit in general, or even asking for help in here. Thank you in advance   


I dont know where to start about my mental health... well, first of, I can say that I grew up in Lithuania, and in here, mental health is not really taken care of well, unless its serious, such as schizophrenia, or PTSD, then you get a place in asylum. Everything else less than that, is considered nothing, or so I was told.  


It all started in 2021 March, when covid hit. I got between job changes and pandemic, and was very stressed about losing my home. And also had health problems at the time. Thats when I noticed that I have a hard time concentrating. But I thought nothing of it, despite bad things happening.  
Fast forward to 2022, I went trough several breakups, which damaged me even more. I was barely eating or sleeping, While having to work to survive, and hiding all my emotion.   
Now, in 2024... Im a mess. I get angry easily, I have constant headaches and have difficulty breathing from nerves (I have asthma, but stress affects my breathing now, noticed it about a half year back), and I keep forgetting even the smallest things. Therapists are not affordable for me, and I doubt they work. Couple hours of chitchat, for 50-60 euros. I did several online tests to find out if Im suffering from disorder of some kind. It said it is most likely ASD (Acute Stress Disorder). I should get checked, but Im afraid I will become addicted to the medicine, and I really wouldnt want that. On top of this, I owe money to some people, I work in a job Im not sure Im good at, to pay it back. Have to take care of four people and two apartments with a minimum salary, and yet, Im being blamed that Im lazy and do nothing for the family. I thought of... well.. ending my life, but I could not do it. Im afraid of losing myself to stress, to these nerves, and Im not sure what to do. My only options working out to relieve stress are buying snacks, or having a JO, aka ""private time with myself"". I want to be normal again, like I used to be in 2019 - confident, trusting and loving myself, and actually not caring about critics.

Anxiety,1ds33z2,Severe Health anxiety,"Within the past 8 months, my anxiety turned to the topic of health. I’ve had little attacks thinking i could have a brain tumor or something along the likes of that, but never too severe. Both my family and I have a pretty intense history with anxiety, so it’s a given that i’d have it. 

(the anxiety also sparked after 3 bad weed trips)

Now, onto this whole paragraph. I’ve convinced myself that I have a prion disease, more specifically vCJD. I originally overthought that I have CJD, but it’s been too long for me to have that (I think). I’ve been on the prion episode for around 3 months and symptoms only keep getting worse. 

My symptoms are the following:

-Influx of anxiety
-heart palpitations 
-Partial paranoia
-Dpdr
Constant impending doom
-episodic headaches 
-Flu like symptoms;
post nasal drip
tinnitus 
tmj
moist ears (honestly probably ear wax production)
random “runny” nose (i’ve had issues with sinuses my whole life)
dry eyes/watery eyes
-Vision issues, ophthalmologist said i have a SLIGHT prescription;
~not necessarily blurry vision, more like distorted at distances 
~Floaters (I work on a screen for 10 hours a day+ phone post work)
-Feel like i’m losing control of my left arm (i’m right hand dominant) 
-feel like i’m “light” or “floating”
-feel like i’m in a constant “daze”
-TWITCHES (scares the shit out of me)
-weird issue with my right eye, when i close my right eye, it twitches. (left one does not)
-YAWNING
-I want to say onset of depression (family had history of that”
-pins and needles, twitches on my head (freaks me the fuck out)
-episodic insomnia 
-BRAIN FOG;
stumbling over words
shitty memory
easily distracted 
-hyper sensitive to everything (Sound and Light, i’ve always been super sensitive to light)
-Anisocoria (Photos of me with it when i was a kid)
-Overthinking EVERYTHING (past 2 years)
-Intrusive thoughts (Very annoying) 
-Feeling “slow” 
-Shakiness (not twitching, shakiness)
-Poor coordination 

The list goes on, funnily enough, this all started when I saw something on tiktok about someone dying of a prion disease. 
Of course, i searched it up and noticed i have all the symptoms!!!!!

(Symptoms started developing post search as well) 

I was convinced i had a csf leak because i misinterpreted some article about cjd that prion victims deal with CSF leaks, and I developed all CSF leak symptoms!!!!

This all started with me being super insecure and started noticing my body shape and brain fog. I’ve been battling the brain fog for like 1.5 years and some syndrome came up, Klinefelter!!!! 

I mentally convinced myself I have klinefelter (which is most likely not the case)and then i went down the health anxiety rabbit hole. 

Back to vCJD, i originally went to the ER for dizziness, vision issues, brain fog, and concentration issues (I would spin around in my chair at work and expect to not get dizzy, funny me. You’re also super prone to getting dizzy if you’re in a heightened state, which I was!!) and then that’s when i started down the prion disease rabbit hole. 

Now, i need your input, Anxiety or prion disease? 

PS 19M, likelihood of me having vCJD is highly unlikely.

Anxiety,1cqm2su,Bailing on a trip with friends bc of mental health?,"Hi everyone,

I currently have been dealing with a very rough patch of mental health. I always have some baseline of anxiety and depression, but it is mostly managed. Over the last 2ish months it has worsened, and for the last 2 weeks is honestly at the lowest it’s ever been. I am trying to work on it by addressing the root causes, made an appointment with a therapist for next week, have told my mom about it so she can check in with me, and am considering medication if it doesn’t improve soon. I find myself both really anxious and on edge about everything, and taking joy in nothing. 

The issue is that I’ve had lots of plans made 3-4 months ago with friends that keep coming up, that I am pushing through but honestly feeling worse afterwards. I had a weekend trip with friends 2 hours away for a friends bday 2 weeks ago. I did not want to go at all, but forced myself to push through. I had a bad panic attack that Saturday where I spent the day in my room and blamed it on feeling sick while everyone else was at the beach, and then another when I got home Sunday evening. Plus, everyone “annoyed” me and left me empty (I know it’s the depression, but still. And these are great friends, I just feel off lately)

I have another, much bigger, trip with different friends scheduled for this weekend. This is a 5 day trip, a 7 hour drive each way. Including me, there are 8 people going. 

I’ve been telling myself canceling isn’t an option because these plans were made 6 months ago, but I cannot get excited about it. If anything, it’s sounding extremely draining, and I’ll probably binge drink alcohol while on it to keep off the anxiety and depression since I’ll be surrounded by friends. I have zero desire to be around everyone and an active disinterest in talking to everyone because I find myself getting annoyed easily lately, which I feel awful about since these are some of my best friends. But that’s just where I am right now. I also have major anxiety at the idea of canceling, as I know my friends will be upset and probably mad. 

I can’t tell if it’s just anxiety and depression talking. Meaning, maybe I shouldn’t feed into it/should force myself to go so that I don’t feed into a cycle and slip further into this mental health slope, and that being around friends on a trip could snap me out of it. But I also think back to the smaller trip 2 weeks ago that honestly has made me feel worse, which makes me think forcing myself to go and “power through” when I’m already in a fragile mental state will make me feel even more down.

I’ve never had mental health affect me to this point, so I’m not really sure the best course of action to take in this scenario. I also don’t really want to tell my friends it’s because of anxiety/depression if I back out, which also makes it hard because I know they’d be mad at me.

What would you do in a situation like this/what have you done in the past?

Honestly everyone around me is being super nice and helpful. My new coworkers and my wife. I couldn't do it all without them. But I've been dreading work every morning. I'm terrified I'm gonna make a super costly mistake.

Anxiety,1dpmqnp,health anxiety: taking medication ,"I have taken metoprolol before in the past (I have a chronic illness that causes tachycardia) so I need it to really function but I got off of it a while ago and tried a new med that gave me terrible side effects so I went cold turkey and stopped taking anything.  I felt pretty bad mentally afterwards, really bad anxiety and depression.  I do think it had something to do with hormones as well but the meds pushed it over the edge.  I need to take metoprolol again (it worked for me the first time I took it) but after my bad experiences and feelings of depression I am REALLY scared to take any meds again.  I know it’s silly since it worked for me in the past but I just had an anxiety attack and bawled my eyes out before I could muster up the courage to finally take the pill.

Anxiety,1cq0eab,extreme health anxiety/paranoia about taking medications for mental health,"i tried posting this in the bipolar subreddit but it got taken down, understandably so.  strongly plead with you to not read this if you have severe anxiety/paranoia about medication like me. i do not want to trigger anybody. i won’t name specific medications except the one i’m currently afraid to start.

hi everybody. i (f20) was recently diagnosed with bp2 6 days ago. i’m also diagnosed OCD and GAD. i am kinda unsure if the bipolar is an accurate diagnosis, but i definitely have issues with my mood. i have depressive episodes that are so severe it becomes incredibly difficult to care for myself, and it’s made me drop out of college. i have also had VERY sparse periods of time where i might’ve been manic? not sure. i can provide more context about my “mania” if you ask in the comments.

anyways, i have always had massive anxiety about medication. i’ve been on like 6 different medications, mostly SSRIs/SNRIs, and other than two (both were horrible for me for different reasons), i have never been able to consistently take something for long enough to see if it actually works because i get insanely anxious/mildly paranoid about side effects. 

i’m currently in outpatient therapy because i literally cannot take care of myself or live life at all. i was prescribed an SSRI my first month there. i took it once, it gave me the worst anxiety of my life after the first dose (it felt like i was having an anxiety attack but for an entire day and i was inconsolable) so i never took it again. 

i lied and told my psychiatrist that the SSRI “wasn’t helping me despite taking it every day for two weeks”. she ended up prescribing me a new medication that i wont name for the sake of not triggering anybody, but it was an SNRI. it took me two weeks to actually try it. she was practically pleading with me to take the damn meds. so i took it. i got serotonin syndrome 24hrs after my first dose. it was fucking traumatizing.

of course, all this did was fuel my anxiety more. it’s not just anxiety anymore. it’s full blown paranoia.

the SNRI made me “manic” which i i am probably in denial about because i have some textbook symptoms… i haven’t been able to sleep for more than 3-4 hours a night for weeks, im highly irritable, and have the absolute WORST racing thoughts. the past 3 weeks have totally blipped by. my irritability gets so bad it makes me want to self-destruct. this, among other symptoms, was what prompted the bipolar diagnosis last week. so of course my psych prescribed me a mood stabilizer: Lamictal.

the nurse at my OP facility asked if i started it on friday, to which i said no. he was pleading with me to just try it. i reluctantly told him i will give it a shot and i picked it up from the pharmacy today, and i’ve been a fucking mess. i’m so scared to take it. i am going to really try to force myself to, but idk if i can do it. the paranoia is soo strong, and if this doesn’t work, i really don’t want to fucking try any more medications. which i know would be very bad if i’m truly bipolar…  

idk i’m just not feeling very confident that i’ll ever be able to reach stability at this point, especially with my lack of willingness to try/stick to meds. my mood swings are kind of dangerous at this point. i feel like i’m barely getting by with my healthy coping skills at the moment, and im so scared that this new medication will make my mood worse, because if it does, i’ll probably need to be placed in inpatient. 

it’s been very difficult to keep myself from self-destructing lately, and i’m scared it’ll make my mental health worse, or i’ll get very sick/die in some horrible way with this new medication. i just don’t have any hope or faith at this point and i honestly can’t say for sure if i will be starting the medication tomorrow… please idk what to do",1,0,i tried posting this in the bipolar subreddit but it got taken down understandably so strongly plead with you to not read this if you have severe anxiety paranoia about medication like me i do not want to trigger anybody i won t name specific medications except the one i m currently afraid to start hi everybody i f was recently diagnosed with bp days ago i m also diagnosed ocd and gad i am kinda unsure if the bipolar is an accurate diagnosis but i definitely have issues with my mood i have depressive episodes that are so severe it becomes incredibly difficult to care for myself and it s made me drop out of college i have also had very sparse periods of time where i might ve been manic not sure i can provide more context about my mania if you ask in the comments anyways i have always had massive anxiety about medication i ve been on like different medications mostly ssris snris and other than two both were horrible for me for different reasons i have never been able to consistently take something for long enough to see if it actually works because i get insanely anxious mildly paranoid about side effects i m currently in outpatient therapy because i literally cannot take care of myself or live life at all i was prescribed an ssri my first month there i took it once it gave me the worst anxiety of my life after the first dose it felt like i was having an anxiety attack but for an entire day and i was inconsolable so i never took it again i lied and told my psychiatrist that the ssri wasn t helping me despite taking it every day for two weeks she ended up prescribing me a new medication that i wont name for the sake of not triggering anybody but it was an snri it took me two weeks to actually try it she was practically pleading with me to take the damn meds so i took it i got serotonin syndrome hrs after my first dose it was fucking traumatizing of course all this did was fuel my anxiety more it s not just anxiety anymore it s full blown paranoia the snri made me manic which i i am probably in denial about because i have some textbook symptoms i haven t been able to sleep for more than hours a night for weeks im highly irritable and have the absolute worst racing thoughts the past weeks have totally blipped by my irritability gets so bad it makes me want to self destruct this among other symptoms was what prompted the bipolar diagnosis last week so of course my psych prescribed me a mood stabilizer lamictal the nurse at my op facility asked if i started it on friday to which i said no he was pleading with me to just try it i reluctantly told him i will give it a shot and i picked it up from the pharmacy today and i ve been a fucking mess i m so scared to take it i am going to really try to force myself to but idk if i can do it the paranoia is soo strong and if this doesn t work i really don t want to fucking try any more medications which i know would be very bad if i m truly bipolar idk i m just not feeling very confident that i ll ever be able to reach stability at this point especially with my lack of willingness to try stick to meds my mood swings are kind of dangerous at this point i feel like i m barely getting by with my healthy coping skills at the moment and im so scared that this new medication will make my mood worse because if it does i ll probably need to be placed in inpatient it s been very difficult to keep myself from self destructing lately and i m scared it ll make my mental health worse or i ll get very sick die in some horrible way with this new medication i just don t have any hope or faith at this point and i honestly can t say for sure if i will be starting the medication tomorrow please idk what to do,-0.018245450537117198,-0.9988,NEGATIVE,0.9989181756973267,neutral,negative,negative
Anxiety,1bmwhwc,I hate how my health issues have led to hypersensitivity that triggers anxiety attacks,"TW: health issues, ED

&#x200B;

Hi, I'm new.

For the past 4 months, I have been having health issues that have caused me to become underweight. Being underweight is a new struggle for me, because I feel everything. EVERYTHING. I feel my heartbeat, my muscles and joints ache, I get sharp pains out of nowhere, I'm dizzy, my chest constantly feels tight --- the list goes on and on.

&#x200B;

I even feel my own digestion, which triggers my newfound anxiety flare-ups. Basically, I get shortness of breath, sharp chest & arm pains, dizziness/lightheadedness, pressure in my head, etc. Every time I eat, I later feel like I'm having a heart attack. And I absolutely hate it --- the feeling and the impact it's had on my quality of life.

It's taken a while to realize that my flare-ups are caused by digestion as my body gets used to eating regularly. For context, there was a month when I was almost starving due to a lack of appetite and nausea, which I somehow didn't notice until two weeks in. After this time, I ended up in the ER, and since then have been in and out of ERs, seeing all kinds of specialists trying to figure out what the heck is going on. (They think a virus/infection triggered my lack of appetite, and most everything else after has been caused by lack of nutrition, dehydration, and not eating)

Before all this, I loved food, and honestly looking back, eating until I was full was a privilege. I liked being alone, driving places, hanging out with friends, and staying up late. Now, all that's changed and I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that this is going to take months of mental and physical recovery. And only I can be the one that helps that process.

It's so frustrating and disheartening, and despite being surrounded by friends and family, I've never felt so alone because no one truly understands what it's like to constantly be in pain and to have everything that was once a comfort no longer feel safe. I almost wish to get seriously ill so I could be fixed in a hospital and have the responsibility of my recovery taken off my shoulders. I'm crying almost every day, and even my parents' support is starting to wear thin. I'm getting depressed, moody, and feel like I'm going crazy knowing it's all in my head. I feel like I'm the lamest person alive, crying when all I have to do is go on 5-minute walks, and eat and drink to get better. But when eating and drinking triggers the symptoms, it almost feels better just wasting away.

Anxiety,15n4r3g,"Physical Symptoms (Muscle/joint pain), Health Anxiety","Apologies for the long post...

Hello! Essentially, I am curious as to whether my experiences with muscle and joint pain during the past couple years seem anxiety-related to you all (based on your own anecdotal experiences and observations).

For the purposes of background information, I have always been extremely healthy and fit up until late 2021. I was a cross country runner and soccer player in high school, and then I took up weightlifting and became quite strong/bulked up throughout my years in undergrad. I even studied kinesiology for my bachelor's degree, became an exercise physiologist, and (this past week) graduated with a master's degree in exercise physiology. 

However, beginning in my first semester as a grad student, I began to pick up more and more injuries when exercising and going about life. I first felt pain in my knee one day on a leg extension machine (using light weight) and it continued to feel strange (still does) despite an x-ray showing nothing but a little fluid on the knee. The doctor performed all of the typical ligament, joint, and muscular tests to assess knee function before just telling me to take it easy for 2-3 weeks. I did as I was told and stopped lower body weightlifting and limited myself to walks with my dog for 2 weeks. Whenever I tried to use that knee thereafter, it just felt loose and ached, so I just stopped doing lower-body lifting entirely. I continued with my upper body lifting that semester and then began to experience pain in my elbows just a month later (insertion points for the biceps and triceps). I tried to work around that pain and do alternative activities that didn't put as much direct stress on the arm to spare myself further pain. Finally, by the end of the semester, even my wrist began to give me grief just doing simple tasks like typing, writing, washing dishes, etc. I started to feel like my body was just falling apart and I had no idea why. 

I was convinced that there was something going on, fearing that I might have developed an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis. I dropped a ton of money (far more than I could afford honestly) going to doctors and getting a barrage of tests performed (typical blood panels, metabolic panels, inflammatory and autoimmune biomarkers, etc.). Everything came back perfect. Both of the doctors I went to ultimately told me that, by their judgement, I was totally fine. They asked me about my anxiety and stress levels, past trauma experiences, etc. I explained that while I had lost my father in high school and consequently dealt with bad anxiety, depression, and grief for a while, I felt like I had ""moved past"" all of that since I had managed to enjoy the final years of high school, get through undergrad with no issue, etc. I knew how that mental/emotional anxiety felt at that time, and I really wasn't experiencing that despite obviously having a lot of stress as a grad student with classes, teaching, and financial situations. 

Then, after being brushed off, I actually BECAME more stressed, anxious, and depressed. I really sort of withdrew for the better part of a year because I felt like my identity and lifestyle were both being taken from me. Not only was I unable to keep working out or playing sports due to constantly finding myself injured and in pain, I also started to feel embarrassed and ashamed of no longer being the fit/athletic person that I considered myself to be (and knew my friends viewed me as). I really found myself in a dark place. 

Since then, I've started to really believe that it might all be anxiety that has simply taken on a new form (different from how I experienced anxiety in high school). I picked up swimming as a non-weight bearing activity and began swimming several miles a week in the campus pool. Despite sometimes experiencing the same thing (a new pain appearing and bothering me), I found that I could eventually work through it a bit. After a couple months of that, I decided to try to start lifting weights again. I took things very slow, emphasizing high rep/set counts rather than weight. If I increased the weight, I found that things would begin to hurt. While my muscles felt strong enough to handle the weight, a few joints would just ache (elbow, knee, etc.). This frustrated me, but I pushed through it (within reason). 

Now, I have continued to do these activities the past 7-8 months. I worked up to longer, more intense cardio and also increased my weightlifting frequency. I started to do long hikes (10-14 miles) in the mountains and even started to run again occasionally. However, I still cannot shake the pain despite managing to do more nowadays. I still have pain in these same joints that is present 5-6 days out of the week. Some days, my knee will feel great (like I could play soccer or run with no problem) or my elbows will handle a lot more weight than usual before giving me any problems. On other days, though, I will find myself forced to cut a workout short or greatly alter things because these joints hurt so much even if I am basically doing the exact same workout. This is the case even though I take the time to perform a thorough warm-up, stretch after each workout, and take an additional rest-day here and there. 

This all brings me to wonder if I am just dealing with this chronic, background anxiety/stress from school, life, and past issues (father's passing) that has manifested in the form of muscle tension, joint pain, and a hyperfixation on these symptoms. Have any of you experienced/do any of you experience something similar to this? 

TL;DR = Do any of you experience persistent and strange muscle/joint pain that you believe is the result of anxiety and stress? If so, what are the characteristics of those symptoms and how have you managed them? 

Any and all thoughts/comments are welcome. I am just curious about everyone else's experiences with anxiety and if there is any overlap with my own symptoms/story.",6,11,apologies for the long post hello essentially i am curious as to whether

through undergrad with no issue etc i knew how that mental emotional anxiety felt at that time and i really wasn't experiencing that despite obviously having a lot of stress as a grad student with classes teaching and financial situations then after being brushed off i actually became more stressed anxious and depressed i really sort of withdrew for the better part of a year because i felt like my identity and lifestyle were both being taken from me not only was i unable to keep working out or playing sports due to constantly finding myself injured and in pain i also started to feel embarrassed and ashamed of no longer being the fit athletic person that i considered myself to be and knew my friends viewed me as i really found myself in a dark place since then i've started to really believe that it might all be anxiety that has simply taken on a new form different from how i experienced anxiety in high school i picked up swimming as a non weight bearing activity and began swimming several miles a week in the campus pool despite sometimes experiencing the same thing a new pain appearing and bothering me i found that i could eventually work through it a bit after a couple months of that i decided to try to start lifting weights again i took things very slow emphasizing high rep set counts rather than weight if i increased the weight i found that things would begin to hurt while my muscles felt strong enough to handle the weight a few joints would just ache elbow knee etc this frustrated me but i pushed through it within reason now i have continued to do these activities the past months i worked up to longer more intense cardio and also increased my weightlifting frequency i started to do long hikes miles in the mountains and even started to run again occasionally however i still cannot shake the pain despite managing to do more nowadays i still have pain in these same joints that is present days out of the week some days my knee will feel great like i could play soccer or run with no problem or my elbows will handle a lot more weight than usual before giving me any problems on other days though i will find myself forced to cut a workout short or greatly alter things because these joints hurt so much even if i am basically doing the exact same workout this is the case even though i take the time to perform a thorough warm up stretch after each workout and take an additional rest day here and there this all brings me to wonder if i am just dealing with this chronic background anxiety stress from school life and past issues father's passing that has manifested in the form of muscle tension joint pain and a hyperfixation on these symptoms have any of you experienced do any of you experience something similar to this tl dr do any of you experience persistent and strange muscle joint pain that you believe is the result of anxiety and stress if so what are the characteristics of those symptoms and how have you managed them any and all thoughts comments are welcome i am just curious about everyone else's experiences with anxiety and if there is any overlap with my own symptoms

Anxiety,16rknh1,I am architecture student with anxiety disorder. I just stopped putting all-nighters for my mental health. Now Im behind my peers. Is this fine?,"As an architecture student with adhd, I just started forcing myself to sleep and refusing to put allnighters. As a result I’m kinda behind my colleagues. Is this fine?

So I’m a third year in architecture, undergrad program. I just had a big mental breakdown not long ago which led to a gap year before my third year and also led to diagnoses of adhd, anxiety and depression. 

This year I promise myself to take care of my mental health and I begin the initiative to not putting all-nighters anymore and to never sleep less than 5-6 hours. However I’m already very behind my classmates. I happened to know that my classmates have been pretty much working with this class 24/7 which I think is very unhealthy and I don’t want to do that.  However our professor demands so much of us in very little time. That’s why my classmates have been putting all nighters to keep up with our prof’s expectations. 

This is the first time I force myself not to do too much work in studio class because that’s what I was doing in the first 2 years and while I was pretty successful, I ended up having a nervous breakdown. 

My question is, is it fine to not meet with my prof’s expectations? Is it ok to sleep and just show up to desk crits or even reviews with less than what my prof asks of or with unfinished work? Will I fail if I don’t put all-nighters?

Anxiety,1bch1ye,Overcoming Anxiety and Chest Pain: My Journey to Better Mental and Physical Health,"A couple of years ago, I found myself battling depression, and amidst that struggle, I experienced a sharp pain in my left chest. Brushing it off initially, I continued with life, but the pain persisted and intensified. Eventually, I ended up in the ER where an EKG indicated that my heart was healthy.

Despite the reassurance, the pain lingered, affecting my sleep and appetite. Fear of heart disease consumed me, leading to moments of panic where I thought a heart attack was imminent. Numbness in my hand and shortness of breath added to the anxiety, creating a cycle of worry.

After months of suffering, I sought the expertise of a cardiologist who confirmed the health of my heart and provided exercises to alleviate stress. Seeking mental health support, I consulted a psychiatrist who prescribed citalopram. Though challenging, the medication played a crucial role in my recovery.

Fast forward to today, I feel much better overall. However, occasional chest discomfort persists, especially during stress or hot showers. As I engage in chest exercises at the gym, I worry that I might be aggravating the pain. I would appreciate any insights or advice from those who may have experienced something similar.

Anxiety,1bwg184,Dealing with Mental Health Struggles and Social Anxiety,"Hey everyone,  
I've been going through a rough patch for about 7 months now, dealing with anxiety, depression, and OCD among other things. It's been a rollercoaster of worries, with the focus changing from one thing to another. Right now, what's been bothering me the most is feeling distant from my university friends.  
They've noticed something's up and have reached out, asking if everything's okay. But honestly, talking about my mental health makes me super uncomfortable. So, I put on a brave face, act like everything's normal, and then deal with a massive anxiety wave later. It's like a never-ending cycle of overthinking and feeling overwhelmed.  
The thing is, I'm considering cutting off most of my friends because it's all just too much right now. But then my anxiety kicks in, telling me I'll be completely alone, and that terrifies me.  
Opening up about these struggles is really scary for me. I'm not used to sharing personal stuff, and even writing this post is a huge step out of my comfort zone.  
So, I'm reaching out to you all for some advice. What do you think I should do? How can I navigate this tricky situation without feeling like I'm drowning in anxiety all the time?

It's more so situational cause she's been struggling to get a job for months and is stuck at home with her mom. But I digress.

Usually we have to console each other even if the other person triggers the other, or I have to sound positive for her even if I don't feel positive myself. Or maybe I feel like I said the wrong thing (like right now) so it triggers my anxiety/catastrophizing thinking that I made her feel worse and made her have darker thoughts. 

I do periodically remind her to find a potential therapist, but overall I just feel powerless when she's feeling really down. And of course, the whole thing triggers *me.* Because I worry for her and it influences my mood/mental health issues.

Anxiety,1azvyct,"My health anxiety is consuming me, advice needed!","(Trigger Warning: Relatively detailed description of heart related symptoms (Palpitations) and mentions of cardiac arrest)

Hello,  
  
So, i've been experiencing another bad health anxiety episode recently and my doctors appointment is still a little while away and i really need some advice, because it just can't go on like this.  
  
First, a little about my current episode: I'm 18f and have had quite severe health anxiety for around 2 years now. Recently, i've been experiencing pretty bad heart palpitations. They happen around once every 2 days or so, but every time they happen they are horrible. It feels as if my heart is cramping and being squeezed really hard. It doesn't hurt but renders me unable to breathe or move for a good 5 to 7 seconds. My heart rate always increases a lot and i feel a panicked fluttering in the chest for about 10 to 15 minutes afterwards. It's made even worse by the fact that, for as long as i can remember, i've always been able to feel my heart beat in my chest, so it feels even more severe when the palpitations happen.  
  
As far as i am aware, my blood pressure is normal, but my last test was 8 months ago, so i can't be sure. I'm convinced its agina (coronary artery disease) or heart disease, because i struggle with bad sensory issues with foods, so my diet is quite unhealthy. I just always panic that i'm currently dying and when i finally go to the doctor its too late and they tell me i only have months left to live. Or even that ill go into sudden cardiac arrest.   
It's absolutely consuming me and i really, really hate it. It's undeniably intercepting with my day to day life, because i even have to leave class sometimes, due to the fact that i feel like i am dying and don't want to traumatise others with my sudden death. I'm driving my parents and boyfriend insane with always being unreasonably anxious. And of course, i am ruining my mental health. I'm already depressed enough, i do not need this.  
If anyone knows how to effectively deal with episodes like these, please tell!

So much for that. Not gonna argue with them because the thought of talking with a mod makes me, obviously....too nervous and intimated.

It does make my social anxiety disorder go into overdrive thinking that everytime I type, am I just wasting my breath to get banned over it? Kicking myself due to SAD makes me take a VERY long time for me usually to want to talk about ...anything personal...anything lately aside from the humdrums of work or boring things like what goes on in my city.  I let a lot of things fester, until I simply cannot take it anymore - so it always comes out an anxious word salad (been getting worse lately- some days I barely feel like I can string a single sentence together), so depression/self-loathing/trigger filled I recognize I must be an awful, no good ahole for it. It's killed relationships, friendships, you've name it, because talking to a person like me is stressful and/or boring, mmhmm. Not gonna talk again about any deeper than that, despite it still very, very much still exists within me. I've learned it's stupid to talk about your true feelings, apparently. Or what to do when they become too much to deal with.

Don't know what to do. My HMO no longer has guarantees of appointments for their mental health dept anymore. They shut off their online scheduling and will only do so via phone - and it's a daily phone tag game of calling for cancellations or an appointment months in the future with no follow ups. When your core issue of your SAD is phone phobia, no, it's not gonna work out. Been that way since I was a 17 year old kid, I'm 35 now, and still will not order pizza/room service unless they have an online option, among many other things. :T

Regional healthcare has already declared a shortage of mental health techs. Local state hospital has tech-patient abuse allegations in their past and my local ER will leave you sleeping in a hallway for 12 hours with little monitoring (mother was just there for cardio issue six months ago), only using 72hr holds in their locked wards.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,I take Klonopin daily. It's the only thing that truly helps.,"I saw a post from earlier today about klonopin but it was locked. Many comments demonized benzo use, as usual. It's basically if Satan and Hitler had a baby and converted it into a tablet.


I've take a low dose of Klonopin essentially daily for many years now. I've posted about it here before but not in awhile. I've posted my story, which I'll briefly tell again:


Anxiety forever due to I believe genetic reasons and bullying growing up. Depression was there as well. In 2013 it boiled over into panic attacks and I've never been the same. I believe it was due to personal stress + first responder stress + financial stress + alcohol abuse + high caffeine intake.


Since then I've tried two dozen mental health medications for my symptoms which are anxiety, depression, brain fog, OCD and such. SSRIs helped take the edge off but chronic anxiety remained right beneath the surface. These other meds caused many other side effects from sexual dysfunction to weight gain to exacerbation of dissociation and anhedonia. I've even tried Spravato, which was tedious.


Additionally I've tried other avenues. Therapy (on number 4), supplements (Ex: L-Theanine, Taurine, probiotics, Lithium Orotate, methylfolate, and much more), hormone therapy (diagnosed low T and am on TRT), meditation, and more.


Klonopin is the only thing that helps adequately. I don't feel GREAT and still suffer daily, especially with dissociation, but klonopin makes it more tolerable. I try to not take it and power through and I regret it every single time. So what're my choices? Take it and live a more tolerable life so I can work, be present for my family, and be able to merely go shopping without feeling super dizzy and disoriented OR suffer? 


I don't abuse it recreationally, nor have I ever. I don't use illicit drugs. I don't use marijuana. I don't drink alcohol. I just want klonopin and to use it as prescribed without being demonized by others. I don't even take my full dose of .5mg, I usually take a half in the morning and maybe another quarter or half mid day as needed.


I dont think it should be the first plan of attack on anxiety, I get that. But when someone has exhausted the ""safer"" options then this should be allowed without question. How medications pcer the past decade went from them being thrown at you with ease to being super strict isn't OK. For example, pain meds. I had spine surgery and they gave me 4 pain pills.

Anxiety,19f6bza,Severe Health Anxiety Struggles,"(I believe this could trigger someone if sensitive to heart rate or specific health topics) This is going to be a long vent, I just can’t seem to tell anyone about it because people will just say I’m a hypochondriac (which I’m aware of) and that’s unhelpful. 
(I say severe health anxiety because that’s what my psychiatrist has labeled it as, also I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder which all play roles in my anxiety.) 

To start this off, I have cardiophobia. So I’m basically afraid of my own heart, heart beat, beats per minute, and etc. This has played a big role in my health anxiety before, and now it has returned. I had gotten a new medication, a ssri, to try and manage my MDD and GAD. There are only 3 antidepressants that work for my dna. I had talked myself into taking this medication for around 2 months before I finally did. I took it for 2 days total, first day started off with just a headache and nausea. Second day I had a resting bpm of around 120 and completely freaking myself out. Ended up going to a crappy emergency room that had someone who was a student doctor (not even a licensed one yet) on my case. He had dismissed my whole issue and instead of telling me that a high heart rate on new meds was normal (which I later found out) shot right to saying I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) so this began my spiral. 
(I had a EKG done on my heart and everything came back healthy)
I had refused the cat scan with contrast in the middle of having a really bad anxiety attack that made me pace around the room and caused lactic acid to burn in my chest. He told me that “If I wanted to live I had the let the professionals do their job” after me saying that I’m too young to die (18F). 
Once I got home I was in a constant state of panic I suppose partly due to anxiety and partly due to my ptsd. I couldn’t walk without my heart rate shooting up and I couldn’t eat or drink anything out of fear for my heart rate going up. I had laid on the floor in my living room for a whole day constantly in a state of panic, until I got my test results back for my heart saying everything was fine and that (like stated before) my heart was just doing a normal thing to compensate for my anxiety and new medication. 
After reading this I was so relieved and finally calmed down, I was able to walk around, eat and drink a little, and feel slightly better. This lasted for a few days until a really bad panic attack happened (again due to my heart) where I spun in circles on the floor, threw up acid too many times to count, and the left side of my chest burned really bad for a consistent 7 hours until I finally went to the ER. Mind you I went to the ER around 6am so this lasted all night. 
Once I got there I slowly started to calm down and even got to sleep a tiny bit in the car since I had someone driving me. This hospital was amazing, the doctor and nurse actually listened to me and explained everything in detail while telling me I in fact definitely did not have a pulmonary embolism. He’s the one who explained that my heart rate was normal in my situation, wasn’t too high, lactic acid and acid reflux was causing my chest to burn, and I was just experiencing this very long panic attack due to being in a constant state of mental stress for a good period of time. Once again, I felt better for the rest of that day. Next morning it’s Christmas Day and I wake up around 5am to terrible nausea, I was going out of state in a few hours and felt awful so back to the er (since everywhere else was closed) to get anti nausea meds. They helped, I was able to eat a little bit but wouldn’t eat until I was full so my heart rate wouldn’t go up. My trip lasted 2 weeks and this whole ordeal lasted around 3. In that time frame I lost 12 pounds. 
Here I am now, still somewhat checking my heart rate and eating fairly better but I’m anxious mostly about my throat and lungs because of that first doctor even though I was told that my lungs and heart are alright. It’s a whole process to getting back to being the way I was before the medication but I’m happy I feel better now.

Anxiety,17ca1m5,HEALTH ANXIETY TO THE MAX,"I have an inordinate amount of Health Anxiety. This started after a traumatic health event starting in May 2022, which continued for a few months. I had been having stomach pains which I attributed to work stress. After several months, I basically fell in the floor at home from back pain and went to ER. There I discovered it was not my back, but a gallbladder issue. The local Hospital did not have a surgeon available and sent me by ambulance to a medical center 100 miles from home.  There I had an ERCP prior to them scheduling gallbladder removal. Somehow I aspirated and was placed on a ventilator. GB surgery was postponed and, after 4 days I was released with GB removal scheduled for late June.  I had been diagnosed with virtually every ""itis"", colonitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, along with fatty liver, etc. All were attributed to bad gallbladder and inflammation. I was sent home on oxygen and told to return for GB removal on 6/23. Had GB out on that date and after several weeks returned to work and had typical recovery. I did see my GP in late June and was assured that everything was going as normal. 5-6 months later, I developed frequent diarrhea and believed it was a byproduct of surgery. Tried every OTC supplement and available My deep fear of doctors and testing led me to trying anything but what I read and could try. In July of this year, I decided that anxiety was overwhelming and sought counselling where I received Celaxa and Ativan(to be used as needed). I saw a MD who prescribed a bile binder and suggested Metamucil to regulate diarrhea. This worked quite well for a few weeks and I thought I was on right track. Stools are now better formed but some digestive issues still exist. My nerves are shot and I can't sleep most nights. I cannot pass a bathroom without thinking I need to go. Most times I have no stool and move on, worrying about when the next poop will come. It is so depressing and I am frustrated that I am not mentally strong enought to halt this behavior.

Anxiety,u3vpge,For people with Heart Health Anxiety (reposted from r/healthanxiety)," Reposted from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/bimyyl/for_people_with_heart_health_anxiety/) because r/healthanxiety might be closing soon

*IM NOT A DOCTOR, so only read further IF YOU'VE BEEN CHECKED OUT BY YOUR DOCTOR AND TOLD YOU'RE HEALTHY*

I  wrote a post with tips for Heart Health Anxiety a while back; I've been  struggling with some health anxiety in the past few days and I wanted  to put some of the things that help me calm down in here;

1. A heart can either be **healthy** or **sick**. There's no **in-between** option.

A  healthy heart is one that's been checked by doctors, in some cases,  multiple times and by multiple doctors and they've all agreed that  there's nothing wrong with it. The heart is obviously a vital organ so  if there was something seriously wrong it would show **symptoms**. But get this : It would show symptoms ***CONSTANTLY***;

It  wouldn't be like ""Oh, let me hurt a bit, then calm down for the rest of  the day and tomorrow I'll get a few palpitations and then be fine for a  few weeks and then act up again""; Uh uh. That is how a ***HEALTHY*** heart acts when being confronted with other things such as: ***stress, anxiety, food consumption, alcohol, sleep (or lack of it), smoking, hard exercise, hormones;***

A sick heart would **let you know**. There would be symptoms that **don't go away**.  A swelling in legs that lasts weeks, pain that never stops, breathing  issues that get worst through months etc; And for all of you that have  been checked by doctors and told all clear - a sick heart would show up  on **every, no matter how basic, of a test**   doctors do. It would show up in blood works, it would show up in EKG,  it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all  the damn time, every time you go and ask for a check up. The symptoms of  a sick heart ***do not hide.*** They make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap;

2.   A sudden heart attack/cardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances:

\-  Your heart is sick/born with a defect from birth; These types of sudden  heart attacks/arrest are often if not always the result of someone not  having symptoms and ***NOT CHECKING*** their heart fully; They're usually quite young people who's never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just **assume**  that theres nothing wrong with them. I have a friend, 22F, with no  symptoms that went for a day-to-date easy check up and the doctor heard a  murmur in her heart **straight away**  and now she knows what to do and what not to do; If your doctor has  checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that -  **healthy with no birth defect;**

\-  You've lived usually 40+ years of unhealthy lifestyle and you're  probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol,  arteries build up etc, things that doctors, ***AGAIN***,  would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your  lifestyle for the better if you don't want to suffer a heart attack.

\- An accident, like getting electrocuted;

**A healthy heart does not just GIVE UP without outside force making it do so.**

That  outside force can also be food, stress, sedentary lifestyle, but these  are all things you can help yourself with; If it's something you can't  help, like lets say hormones during period/pregnancies  (like it was for  me) or work related stress, all you can do is wait it out and believe  it will come to an end; ***It always does;***

3.   People who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task  until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own  heart symptoms; I know that I do. I'm not much of a perfectionist  myself, but I can focus very strongly on things that I deem important;  If there's a problem I'll focus on it until I've made it go away.  However, example, focusing on a heart palpitations I've got only makes  me more stressed which in result brings **even more palpitations**  and the circle begins; Realising that you're good at focusing can help  you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on  it, examine it from all sides, think of all possible outcomes and  completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even  more anxiety and even more symptoms;

Its nearly impossible to **STOP** focusing on something that scares you; So the alternative is, instead of stopping the focus, to **shift it to LOGIC**.  Shift it to past experiences when you've had this symptom and it's gone  away on its own; Shift to doctors telling you you're fine. Shift to ""I  just had a lot of chocolate today"", ""its hormones"", ""Its just stress"";  And no, this is **not ignoring the problem**.  Believe me, I've been there and I'd tell myself ""what are you doing!!!  How can you try to calm yourself that its just stress?? What if this  time its not??? What if this time you're really really dying???!!?""...  and well, the simple ""**what if THIS TIME**"" in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well, I'm still here;

I  hope this helps you a bit; Remember, you can always get checked by a  doctor, even if its your 100th time, if that brings you peace, there's  no shame in that; I hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful  day! :)",70,13,reposted from here because r healthanxiety might be closing soon im not a doctor so only read further if you've been checked out by your doctor and told you're healthy

logic shift it to past experiences when you've had this symptom and it's gone away on its own shift to doctors telling you you're fine shift to i just had a lot of chocolate today its hormones its just stress and no this is not ignoring the problem believe me i've been there and i'd tell myself what are you doing how can you try to calm yourself that its just stress what if this time its not what if this time you're really really dying and well the simple what if this time in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well i'm still here i hope this helps you a bit remember you can always get checked by a doctor even if its your th time if that brings you peace there's no shame in that i hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful

Anxiety,18dcsvu,"Thinking about mental health, anxiety? input appreciated","

I was “diagnosed” with depression/anxiety my senior year of high school, but for context I had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue, not mental health. 

Before this I never thought of my mental as bad ever, and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person. After this quote on quote diagnosis which I refer to as such because I feel one questionnaire does not define me and how I feel, but I have had a hard time actually practicing this thought. 

I feel like depression/anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i’m not busy/distracted enough that’s where my mind goes and I feel down or anxious but more that i’m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining. Like I went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but I was still thinking about my mental health and how I am feeling and I feel like it is always looming over whatever I do and it’s very frustrating for me. Recently, my therapist was talking to me and said through our conversations over the years and through a sort of checklist of symptoms/behaviors, she believes me to have ADHD as well. I wonder if this may contribute to my feelings?

I want to live a day where i’m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking. I have been in therapy for 2 ish years which has been helpful but I still struggle with these thoughts. 

We have discussed medication and my doctor and therapist say 25 mg of zoloft could be beneficial, but for many reasons I would be anxious to try it. One thought i’ve been having recently is since i never had mental problems before my “diagnosis” that i’m not actually depressed or anxious rather it’s just a thought that’s in my head that can be sort of a self fulfilling prophecy. So of course I google what would happen if a. normal person had antidepressants and the risk of seratonin syndrome comes up which makes me anxious because i’m very anxious about my health. 

I would like to try it because maybe it can help with my thoughts and help me feel happy again, but the idea of starting it makes me anxious. Any insight or help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",1,2,i was diagnosed with depression anxiety my senior year of high school but for context i had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue not mental health before this i never thought of my mental as bad ever and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person after this quote on quote diagnosis which i refer to as such because i feel one questionnaire does not define me and how i feel but i have had a hard time actually practicing this thought i feel like depression anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i m not busy distracted enough that s where my mind goes and i feel down or anxious but more that i m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining like i went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but i was still thinking about my mental health and how i am feeling and i feel like it is always looming over whatever i do and it s very frustrating for me recently my therapist was talking to me and said through our conversations over the years and through a sort of checklist of symptoms behaviors she believes me to have adhd as well i wonder if this may contribute to my feelings i want to live a day where i m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking i have been in therapy for ish years which has been helpful but i still struggle with these thoughts we have discussed medication and my doctor and therapist say mg of zoloft could be beneficial but for many reasons i would be anxious to try it one thought i ve been having recently is since i never had mental problems before my diagnosis that i m not actually depressed or anxious rather it s just a thought that s in my head that can be sort of a self fulfilling prophecy so of course i google what would happen if a normal person had antidepressants and the risk of seratonin syndrome comes up which makes me anxious because i m very anxious about my health i would like to try it because maybe it can help with my thoughts and help me feel happy again but the idea of starting it makes me anxious any insight or help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated,0.014095207393079743,0.9916,NEGATIVE,0.9928418397903442,neutral,positive,negative
Anxiety,18iuzo5,"Flonase good for allergies, sometimes bad for mental health","I have recently escaped a cycle of chronic anxiety that has plagued me for years, every year for the past 5 years I have gone through bouts of terrible anxiety usually just after the Halloween season, usually these bouts of anxiety involve not sleeping for up to a week, constant panic attacks, a sense of impending doom, and constant restlessness. Incidentally this anxiety tended to coincide with my seasonal allergies, I discovered that Flonase worked wonders for those seasonal allergies, where I could not breathe before suddenly my sinuses would open up, Flonase was a miracle drug as far as I was concerned, I believed it was an effective treatment in my toolbox, something that would ease the stress that was plaguing me.

I stopped taking it immediately, within a day my nose got stuffy but my anxiety dissipated, I'm completely fine now and have been for 2 weeks.

I've always been on the anxious/depressed side, especially as a teenager.. I've never seen a doctor about it, but in the last 10 years or so I've had it mostly under control myself to the point that it wasn't really interfering with my life too much anymore.

But in the last 6-12 months it's been off the charts again, due to a new job and a couple of relationship breakups. To the point of having regular panic attacks at work. Yesterday I mentioned to my mother that I was thinking of seeing my doctor to see if he can write me a note for a couple of weeks off work to see if I can get the stress under control and figure out what to do.  Mum's answer was pretty much ""don't do that, he'll probably put you on meds!"".. To her this is just about the worst thing that could happen.  She very much has narcissistic traits, and the idea of anyone knowing everything isn't fine is something she can't handle.

Anxiety,hqlsf8,At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I’ll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you.

Anxiety,ym5nzd,I could use some encouragement - poor mental health is making it hard to be the mom I want to be,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post. Sorry if it’s not. 

Back story; I have been recently diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and a late diagnosis for PPD (edit to add PPD is postpartum depression). My twins just turned 2. I am working with a psychiatrist and have been bouncing around with different meds trying to find the best fit. I’m between meds and really struggling. 

When I was on some meds that were seeming to help (but ended up having side effects that caused us to need to change) I had more energy and was starting to invest more energy in my kids. Now I’m a struggling again and waiting for the latest ones to kick in. 

I am having trouble with more than the basic needs and chores. I am putting them in-front of the tv WAY more than I ever wanted and I feel horrible about it. They are watching tv right now! But I’m dragging. Badly. When they ask me to play, I do, but I struggle and feel horrible about it. I try to show a calm and patient exterior, but I’m more irritable and get maxed easily. I just feel like a failure. When they aren’t actively needing something I zone out on my phone or do chores. 

I know logically that once I get my stuff figured out that I will be able to work on being a better mom. They know they are loved and I give them all I have. But they deserve more. 

I’m struggling feeling like it’s ok to accept these new diagnoses as I am usually the one helping others through stuff and don’t feel justified claiming issues if my own. But I also know I’m hurting and disappointed in myself as a parent. I’m hoping by accepting it that I will be better able to change it.

Anxiety,ru1pc8,Anyone Else Disgusted With Lousy Mental Health Care Providers & Therapists For Panic Disorder And Anxiety?,"This is going to be long, but here goes. I'm 48 and have had panic attacks and severe anxiety after I was sexually abused at the age of 5.

I was diagnosed back in 1996. I had no idea what was wrong with me all those years. I hid in silence because I could not explain adequately what I was experiencing to my parents and they just thought I was being a drama queen when I had my attacks. When I would have a panic attack I would tell them ""I am getting nervous again"". I spent my whole childhood and young adulthood feeling weird and different. I couldn't go to normal things like sleep over parties, or socialize like everyone else because of the ""spells"" I would get. I only had one good friend and was uncomfortable in crowds or with a lot of people. I am an only child and always felt lonely.

One night back in 1996, I was panicking so bad and so extremely depressed that I called a crisis hotline. They told me I was having panic attacks and gave me the phone numbers of experts to call. I finally had a name for this horror. My first therapist and Psychiatrist were great. I had CBT therapy in conjunction with low dose Xanax and Prozac. Then a year into treatment, I lost my insurance coverage and could not afford to see these providers anymore.

Over the years I took breaks from therapy, but kept taking my meds because I could only afford one provider. Fast forward to a few years ago and my psychiatrist of 21 years decided it was time to retire. He told me I was fucked. I asked why. He told me because nobody was going to prescribe me Xanax as there is a war on drugs going on.

He had to taper me off of them just before he was set to retire. He first tried giving me a low dose of Valium along with a tricyclic antidepressant. The tricyclic depressant made me very sick and I felt zombie like so I dropped it. Prozac was no longer working on me and over the years I tried at least 15 different SSRI antidepressants and none worked or they made me feel bizarre.

I was on a low dose of .5 mg Xanax twice a day for 21 years and never had to raise my dose. The Valium taper was making my panic attacks much worse so he switched it to Xanax extended time release version and I was back to having 4-5 major panic attacks a day. Then he walked out of my life forever and I had no meds at all.

Over the next 3 years I could not find one doctor who would prescribe me Xanax and would only give me antidepressants which are useless for me or make my condition worse. I ended up quitting my job of 6 years and handing over the keys to my car to my husband because the panic attacks were so bad I could no longer drive. I ended up with full blown agoraphobia and didn't barely leave the house for 3 years.

Finally 2 months before my mother suddenly died, I found a nurse practitioner who would give me .5 Xanax twice a day. I immediately started feeling better and wanted to leave the house again. I started going for walks and even drove the car around the block a few times. Then my mother died and my condition became exasperated. I was having panic attacks around the clock. I got a grief counselor and my shitty insurance wouldn't cover her, so I had to pay $200 a session which I could hardly afford. She got mad at me because I filed for disability without telling her while she was away on vacation. She got paperwork when she came back and started yelling at me about the amount of work I caused her.

I was so put off by her attitude that I fired her and told her off. The next day social security called me and said my therapist called them and said that I no longer wanted to pursue my disability claim. I was in shock that she did that. WTF? I told them that was not true and still filed. I was turned down. The reason they gave was that because she told them that I had no disabilities at all. She did that to be spiteful!

Then the next therapist I found tried to be my friend. She asked to go out with me to get some coffee and during another session she asked if I had good handwriting. She wanted me to write 50th birthday party invitations out for her husband's surprise party. I was like WTF?! So I stopped making anymore appointments with her.

The next therapist I got was a young guy who just graduated from college. He started to be all chummy with me and then I noticed our sessions were all about him. I started to feel like I was his therapist and I didn't get a good feeling. He asked me for advice and told me how much he hated his mother. He admitted he was stealing opiates from his grandfather's medicine cabinet. I was quiet as a church mouse when he was telling me this trying not to judge him, because nobody is perfect, but that shocked me. I was thinking of dropping him, but was feeling like maybe it was me expecting too much and maybe the bad feelings I was getting was all ""in my head"" The next session I had an appointment for, the office was all dark and nobody was there when I arrived. Then I was told by the mental health group he was working for, that he was ""no longer with them"". I found out he was fired because he was addicted to opiates.

The next therapist, who was another young person I got told me if I had a panic attack to get a bowl of water and fill it with ice cubes and stick my head in the bowl and that was the cure for panic attacks. Also, I was told to jump into the shower and only turn on the cold water. I was also told to meditate them away and do deep breathing exercises. I told her that does not help me and she said that is the latest and most innovative treatment for anxiety disorders. Meditation and deep breathing exercises make me even more nervous. I quit immediately after that.

Then my final and last therapist dropped me after 3 sessions. He was a psychologist who I actually liked. Instead of 45 minute sessions he would only have 30 minute sessions with me. They moved so quickly, he did not have the time to know more about me. He barely let me get a word in and kept interrupting me when I wanted to tell him a little about what I was going through. Instead, he kept making me write down famous inspirational quotes in a journal which meant nothing to me and weren't helping. We were having phone sessions because of my agoraphobia. The agoraphobia is so bad, I couldn't even leave the house to have a funeral for my own mother and had no services for her at all. My husband had to handle it all for me and got her cremated which was not her last wishes leading me to feeling extreme guilt.

The grief from the loss of my mother is so terrible that my panic attacks got even more frequent and relentless. After the third session, he asked if I was on meds and I told him I take .5 mg Xanax twice a day. He immediately got all quiet. Then he said ""I want you off of the Xanax immediately"". He told me to fire my nurse practitioner and in order to have more sessions with him, I would have to get a psychiatrist and get off the Xanax and take antidepressants instead. He said he does not work with people on controlled substances. I was in a state of shock!

I told him that I did not take them everyday which is the truth and he still would not budge. I was begging him not to abandon me and all he said was ""Sorry"". He told me to call him when I complied with what he told me to do otherwise I was not allowed to have anymore sessions with him. He dropped me 3 days before my first Christmas without my mother. That was a huge blow to me. It made me even more panicked and depressed. I felt so abandoned.

I spent Christmas on the phone with a crisis hotline because I was having severe panic attacks. Since then I have been calling loads of therapists in my health insurance network and either they don't call back after I leave a message on their answering machine, or they say they are filled up and are not taking anymore patients. My grief, anxiety and panic disorder has gotten so bad, I now have an enlarged heart and severe pitting edema where my body has become so swollen I can hardly walk. I think the stress is killing me.

I am feeling like there is no help out there and if there is they are not very good at what they do. I no longer have any trust in the mental health providers out there that are so called ""experts"" in treating anxiety and Panic disorder. I am having more anxiety from the fact that I feel there is no help out there. Do you feel the same? What has happened to you? I would like to hear your stories too so I know I am not the only one dealing with this.",12,20,this is going to be long but here goes i'm and have had panic attacks and severe anxiety after i was

block a few times then my mother died and my condition became exasperated i was having panic attacks around the clock i got a grief counselor and my shitty insurance wouldn't cover her so i had to pay a session which i could hardly afford she got mad at me because i filed for disability without telling her while she was away on vacation she got paperwork when she came back and started yelling at me about the amount of work i caused her i was so put off by her attitude that i fired her and told her off the next day social security called me and said my therapist called them and said that i no longer wanted to pursue my disability claim i was in shock that she did that wtf i told them that was not true and still filed i was turned down the reason they gave was that because she told them that i had no disabilities at all she did that to be spiteful then the next therapist i found tried to be my friend she asked to go out with me to get some coffee and during another session she asked if i had good handwriting she wanted me to write th birthday party invitations out for her husband's surprise party i was like wtf so i stopped making anymore appointments with her the next therapist i got was a young guy who just graduated from college he started to be all chummy with me and then i noticed our sessions were all about him i started to feel like i was his therapist and i didn't get a good feeling he asked me for advice and told me how much he hated his mother he admitted he was stealing opiates from his grandfather's medicine cabinet i was quiet as a church mouse when he was telling me this trying not to judge him because nobody is perfect but that shocked me i was thinking of dropping him but was feeling like maybe it was me expecting too much and maybe the bad feelings i was getting was all in my head the next session i had an appointment for the office was all dark and nobody was there when i arrived then i was told by the mental health group he was working for that he was no longer with them i found out he was fired because he was addicted to opiates the next therapist who was another young person i got told me if i had a panic attack to get a bowl of water and fill it with ice cubes and stick my head in the bowl and that was the cure for panic attacks also i was told to jump into the shower and only turn on the cold water i was also told to meditate them away and do deep breathing exercises i told her that does not help me and she said that is the latest and most innovative treatment for anxiety disorders meditation and deep breathing exercises make me even more nervous i quit immediately after that then my final and last therapist dropped me after sessions he was a psychologist who i actually liked instead of minute sessions he would only have minute sessions with me they moved so quickly he did not have the time to know more about me he barely let me get a word in and kept interrupting me when i wanted to tell him a little about what i was going through instead he kept making me write down famous inspirational quotes in a journal which meant nothing to me and weren't helping we were having phone sessions because of my agoraphobia the agoraphobia is so bad i couldn't even leave the house to have a funeral for my own mother and had no services for her at all my husband had to handle it all for me and got her cremated which was not her last wishes leading me to feeling extreme guilt the grief from the loss of my mother is so terrible that my panic attacks got even more frequent and relentless after the third session he asked if i was on meds and i told him i take mg xanax twice a day he immediately got all quiet then he said i want you off of the xanax immediately he told me to fire my nurse practitioner and in order to have more sessions with him i would have to get a psychiatrist and get off the xanax and take antidepressants instead he said he does not work with people on controlled substances i was in a state of shock i told him that i did not take them everyday which is the truth and he still would not budge i was begging him not to abandon me and all he said was sorry he told me to call him when i complied with what he told me to do otherwise i was not allowed to have anymore sessions with him he dropped me days before my first christmas without my mother that was a huge blow to me it made me even more panicked and depressed i felt so abandoned i spent christmas on the phone with a crisis hotline because i was having severe panic attacks since then i have been calling loads of therapists in my health insurance network and either they don't call back after i leave a message on their answering machine or they say they are filled up and are not taking anymore patients my grief anxiety and panic disorder has gotten so bad i now have an enlarged heart and severe pitting edema where my body has become so swollen i can hardly walk i think the stress is killing me i am feeling like there is no help out there and if there is they are not very good at what they do i no longer have any trust in the mental health providers out there that are so called experts in treating anxiety and panic disorder i am having more anxiety from the fact that i feel there is no help out there do you feel the same what has happened to you i would like to hear your stories too so i know i am not the only

Anxiety,18b21ld,Struggling with Mental Health – Need guidance. Share your wisdom?,"Good evening or good morning, depending on when you're reading this.  
  
I'll be brief and concise: I have suspicions that there's something strange in my head, more precisely, I'm referring to my mental health. I've discussed this with other people, including my mother, who has suggested that I might be suffering from anxiety.  
  
You see, since I was very young (I'm 21 years old), I've been a somewhat independent person, and I believe I shouldn't bother others with my problems because they have their own. There's guilt about being a ""burden"" to my loved ones, and I refused to ask for help for that very reason because I would hate to be a nuisance. The consequences of this toxic independence are that I swallow all my problems, doubts, fears, and sorrows. I don't like to be vulnerable, so I choose to swallow my fears and leave them in a dark corner.  
  
You know what's bad about all this? I don't have reasons to feel so overwhelmed. I lost my teenage years worrying about studies, about being the best, about avoiding others seeing me as a failure. I was too selfish, demanding, and violent with myself. When I should have treated myself with kindness and understanding.  
  
I'm still like that. Too demanding of myself, and when I don't achieve what I expect, I sink into a giant depression where I think the world is falling apart on me.  
  
I started university in 2021. To all this, I'm still in my second year of university. And for some reason, I can't get rid of the first-year exams to have the possibility of moving on to my third year. I should be graduating next year, 2024. But it won't happen; I've already fallen a full year behind, and maybe it will happen again. I know it's not a big deal, but it makes me feel miserable to believe that I'm incapable, a failure with no future.  
  
I've thought about the possibility of seeking psychological help; I feel like I need it. I don't want to self-diagnose, but I've been feeling nervous. To the point where I can't sleep for days. I get tremors; I panic when invasive thoughts come out of nowhere, telling me I have no future. Lately, my body isn't tolerating food very well, and as a result, I've lost some weight. I want to control it, learn to tolerate it, and cope with it, but my body reacts very poorly to all this mental stress, which is gradually deteriorating my physical health too.  
  
These thoughts don't even leave me alone when I have to study. I'm reading, but my stupid brain doesn't shut off for even a second, making everything difficult. I have to start from scratch almost every time; normal activities take me longer than usual.  
  
At the moment, I can't access a therapist. Let's say my country isn't in a good economic situation, and there are other priorities and needs at home. However, if someone is reading this and has gone through similar emotions, I would like to receive some advice on how I can overcome this situation. Sometimes, I feel like I'm about to go crazy, on the verge of collapse because of fears about an uncertain future. I spend whole nights devising plans in case I fail again, when I don't even know if I'm going to fail. It's silly to drown in a small glass of water; I'm sorry.",1,0,good evening or good morning depending on when you're reading this i'll be brief and concise i have suspicions that there's something strange in my head more precisely i'm referring to my mental health i've discussed this with other people including my mother who has suggested that i might be suffering from anxiety you see since i was very young i'm years old i've been a somewhat independent person and i believe i shouldn't bother others with my problems because they have their own there's guilt about being a burden to my loved ones and i refused to ask for help for that very reason because i would hate to be a nuisance the consequences of this toxic independence are that i swallow all my problems doubts fears and sorrows i don't like to be vulnerable so i choose to swallow my fears and leave them in a dark corner you know what's bad about all this i don't have reasons to feel so overwhelmed i lost my teenage years worrying about studies about being the best about avoiding others seeing me as a failure i was too selfish demanding and violent with myself when i should have treated myself with kindness and understanding i'm still like that too demanding of myself and when i don't achieve what i expect i sink into a giant depression where i think the world is falling apart on me i started university in to all this i'm still in my second year of university and for some reason i can't get rid of the first year exams to have the possibility of moving on to my third year i should be graduating next year but it won't happen i've already fallen a full year behind and maybe it will happen again i know it's not a big deal but it makes me feel miserable to believe that i'm incapable a failure with no future i've thought about the possibility of seeking psychological help i feel like i need it i don't want to self diagnose but i've been feeling nervous to the point where i can't sleep for days i get tremors i panic when invasive thoughts come out of nowhere telling me i have no future lately my body isn't tolerating food very well and as a result i've lost some weight i want to control it learn to tolerate it and cope with it but my body reacts very poorly to all this mental stress which is gradually deteriorating my physical health too these thoughts don't even leave me alone when i have to study i'm reading but my stupid brain doesn't shut off for even a second making everything difficult i have to start from scratch almost every time normal activities take me longer than usual at the moment i can't access a therapist let's say my country isn't in a good economic situation and there are other priorities and needs at home however if someone is reading this and has gone through similar emotions i would like to receive some advice on how i can overcome this situation sometimes i feel like i'm about to go crazy on the verge of collapse because of fears about an uncertain future i spend whole nights devising plans in case i fail again when i don't even know if i'm going to fail it's silly to drown in a small glass of water i'm sorry,-0.06819209039548021,-0.9983,NEGATIVE,0.9953422546386719,negative,negative,negative

I am almost constantly worried about my health, whether it’s mentally or physically, and it is beyond exhausting. Every-time something very minor changes or happens to my body, my mind goes into overdrive and I spend hours looking up my symptoms online and worrying over serious illnesses I may have that are untreated and could get worse. It causes a great deal of distress to me, because of the fact that any small thing can trigger it (maybe a small head ache or a migraine) and it exhausts me.

Anxiety,17vxv73,I shouldn't have taken that mental health first aid course,"**Content Warning: Discussion about suicide**

So I had to take a Mental Health First Aid course for my work (administrator at a indigenous-run college) and about a third of the course was spent talking about suicide and what to look for to know if someone is suicidal. This was followed by extended discussions among my indigenous co-workers talking about the guilt and suffering they experienced losing a loved one to suicide (for context, indigenous groups in Canada have the highest rates of suicide in the country so most of my coworkers experienced losing a friend/family member to suicide).

Since completing this course a month ago, this has caused me to become incredibly anxious/worried again about my younger brother. Almost two years ago, he lost his car due to being unable to pay exorbitant repair costs and had to sell it. Since then, I've had bouts of anxiety on and off worrying that losing the use of his car will make him depressed/suicidal since he has to cycle 25 - 30min to work at a physically demanding low-wage job at a chain restaurant with no other career prospects for him.

I wake up every morning feeling anxious that if he does end his life, my family and I will feel the same guilt and misery that my coworkers experienced but we won't have the strength to deal with it. I don't talk with him that often (every two months or so) because I want to respect him and give him space to live his own life without worrying about me pestering him. But I feel bad because he may feel isolated/alone even though he has a mom and three brothers (including me) that love and care for him.

Every time I've spoken with him he says he's doing alright/fine so I guess I should trust him. I'm just wondering if I'm a bad person/brother for only talking with him every two months? Our relationship is good otherwise.

He wants me to move on and I’m heartbroken.

I’ve just cried all night and im still broken. He distracted me from my anxiety and gave me amazing company I’ve never gotten before. He said he will continue to do all this with me but as friends which is fine. And he still wants me to do the same for him. I don’t know, i just feel immensely hurt and lost. This is the first person i ever saw that would work for me. Idk how to feel anymore. How can i cope with a right person wrong time situation?

Edit for context: the discussion of staying friends arose because we were close friends for 10 months prior to discussing a relationship. We weren’t strangers. His driving force was that we were very intimate, and we have supported each other despite not being 100% official. I had that hope we would and he also had that hope but i think it’s best he focused on himself.

Edit #2: Thank you for the three that shared stories. I feel a little better but it’ll take time to heal. He still wants to talk to me and see me in person so i’ll make sure that when we do that there’s someone around or we control ourselves.

Anxiety,17hitum,I had a breakup and I feel crazy with the amount of health anxiety I feel right now.,"So its about two or three weeks ago since I broke up with my girlfriends. I'm polyamorous. And its been real rough on me.  I do have a history of generalized anxiety and panic disorder.  Been five years since diagnosis. This is paired with OCD. But I also have trauma around choking. And when I had covid earlier this year in March for the second time found I could not eat properly from swallowing issues. But it did get better? Anyway so recently I found that I couldn't get food down whatsoever from this breakup. I even went and saw a doctor and got a barrium scan and everything came back normal. I haven't tried testing my blood levels or my hormones to see if they are okay. (I take hormones for gender dysphoria). I booked a referral for an ENT but thats not till the start of next year when I get in. I got a PPI prescription but have not tried it yet. And also got a presciption for Fluoxetine, an anti depressant but yet to try it cause I don't want to start it alone. Cause I find that my panic attacks are coming back and I feel like I can't breathe. Feels like a lump in my throat. Food never seems to get down. But I don't regurgiate so it must go down. But I don't know if this is largely in my heard or GERD. This is my food diary so I thought to include it and that's listed below. I should say I feel very helpless about my anxiety and been sleeping on a couch for two weeks now cause don't have a bed. Planning to contact a doctor who did my mental health plan cause i lost the physical copy to get help mentally. And I am losing the sense to know if this is anxiety or GERD. I just want some support really. Help would be nice.

Anxiety,1652w6j,Health anxiety made me feel like I lost myself,"My worst fear is losing my sanity and my sense of self and my love of life and for the past few days I lost it.

I was experiencing fat embolism symptoms after I damaged my stomach fat tissue, and I felt terrified. I was experiencing shortness of breath, constant chest pressure and occasional pain, and armpit pressure. I convinced myself I had blood clots all over my body because my legs and arms were falling asleep from the slightest pressure and all my veins were bulging suddenly. It made me so scared and 2 days ago I ended up in the ER at 4am because I thought I was having a heart attack.

Every day I spent googling blood clots, heart and brain diseases, and doctors to visit to cure my condition and my family was starting to think I was insane and not actually sick. I was struggling mentally and physically. I stopped writing my journal, playing the games I love, watching anime and movies, and reading and learning. I hate the person who I became. An empty shell that's only filled with fear, terror, anxiety, and dread.

I am scared. Every night I go to sleep fearing that I'll die and I wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. I'm not in school yet so every day I spend my days doing nothing but googling and pacing around the house and when I spend time with my family I can't enjoy anything. There's the fear of dying and my physical symptoms. I keep focusing on my chest pressure, the blood flowing through my body, blood clots, embolisms, dying. I talk to my parents but there is no me. There is only my anxiety, my terror, wearing my skin and pretending to be me.

It's scarier than depression. I feel like I'm standing on the verge of insanity and I just want to feel fine again.

Anxiety,16yqtp8,Health anxiety. Needed advice desperately.,"Since I was a teenager, I have experience high level of health anxiety, I not sure what is the trigger. Have seen psychiatrist, psychologist for several years but all seem not be working out for me. The health anxiety comes and goes and for the past 5 good years it did not come.

My mum has been tired of me behaving this way and yesterday she actually attempted suicide because of my constant worry behavior. I don't want things turn out this way neither but I do not have many friends to begin with, so the only person i can share with is my mother. 

I am feeling very mentally tired over this, i have actually thought of attempting suicide thinking that if I die then I do not need to worry about health issue anymore. My appointment with the psychiatrist is still very long and they do not have earlier slot, so i went to the mental health emergenecy and was got prescribed some pills to manage my anxiety and the psychiatrist to only take when is necessary but I have been taking more amount now as this is the only thing that help me a bit.

Anxiety,12libzu,I keeping losing my job and it's taking a toll on my mental health. How do I cope?,"Long story short, I have had about 16 jobs since starting work at 16 (I'm 32). Before finishing college, I had a long stint of either doing jobs I hated (Cold calling sales jobs, door to door, etc). or working jobs I liked but would have something horrible happen that would cause me to lose my job.  


What typically happens is I will end up getting depressed, which will impact my ability to perform my duties well. I don't have clinical depression, but what happens is if I'm enjoying the job, something unexpected always happens which puts it in jeopardy.   


An example of this is I worked a job where I was the top rated rep in the entire company (over 200 associates), I was doing well but then I found out my girlfriend of 2 years (who started working there) cheated on me, multiple times, with one of the managers. To top it off, everyone in our department knew but me. This made it extremely difficult to do my job and upper management noticed and fired me for lack of performance.  


After graduating college, I got Another job where I did marketing at a startup. I liked working there, but then after 2 years they switched me from marketing to being a cold caller. The work was miserable. I worked there for another 6 months but they fired me again because of ""lack of performance.""

&#x200B;

I finally got another job after looking but was fired from there because they found out I did freelance work on the weekends (which I have to do to have any kind of money saved for an emergency fund).  


And now I'm on the verge of looking for another job AGAIN and it's just made my anxiety skyrocket. I'm worried that even when I get another job that SOMETHING is going to happen to make me lose it again.

Anxiety,1165dit,It all just started with health anxiety,"

In 2020, around October was my first experience with health anxiety. I didn't sleep much for a month or two. I was glued to my screen all day and night watching price charts. I was heavily into stocks. Then I started experiencing eye dryness and tingling on my arms and legs. My biggest mistake was to ask Google. I should've just gone to the doctor. I self-diagnosed. I was convinced I had MS, ALS, Brain Tumor and what made me go to the ER was when my anxiety was so bad I was palpitating hard, I thought I was having a stroke. I had brain MRI and it came back normal.

I felt stupid but my anxiety didn't stop there. I continued to feel something's wrong with me. I even thought of suicide. 

Fast forward to 2023, my biggest fear right now is psychosis/schizo. I am so afraid of losing control. I still often think about suicide. I've had this fear since mid 2022. I haven't hallucinated or lost control, but I still think sooner or later it will happen. I recently read that people are usually diagnosed schizo at 30-33yo and I'm 31 which makes me more anxious. Even though I don't have any family or relatives who have schizo, I still am convinced I have it and will show symptoms sooner or later. Then I've read about bipolar 2 and mental breakdown and psychotic break and I'm convinced I am too will experience the same thing. 

I haven't been diagnosed with OCD but the test I took online says I have severe OCD. I take meds for depression and only take anxiety meds when my anxiety is really really bad.

Anxiety,11x1ojm,Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out. Really need advice and support,"
Hey all, 
For context I’m 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn’t have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I’ve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I’d push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It’s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I’ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I’ve been under, there’s also been physical and health issues I’ve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don’t want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",5,4,hey all for context i m f and in week of l so have just started law school however these past three years but specifically last year was so hard on me on top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died days before my first exam these exams were the ones that dictated whether or not i d get into university for some background my grandpa was like my father to me when i was younger especially my dad wasn t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so i wouldn t see him as a result my grandparents looked after me and i spent countless hours with them and still see my grandma every week as you can imagine his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard but i had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground i went into school no literally minutes after the burial i had to go to school for final exam prep anyways this was in november of i got through exams and for the first time in what felt like forever i felt happy at christmas my mind was clear i was surrounded by family and didn t have any responsibilities i even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where i got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers so i had a brief intermission of calm i was happy for about weeks till about february this year until it all came rushing back anxiety panic attacks derealization just like that put back on mg of lexapro which i ve been on for just under weeks the trigger possibly university being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse but i decided i d push through and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers it s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died exhaustion unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything i ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks i need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal besides the mental strain i ve been under there s also been physical and health issues i ve been dealing with being hyperthyroidism and as of a week ago iron deficiency seems like my body wants me to stop but i don t want to studying gives me a sense of purpose of validation i guess all i ask for is for some advice please this is a big decision for me and i really just want someone to talk to and hear me thank you in advance,0.0010666666666666713,-0.9413,NEGATIVE,0.9839211702346802,neutral,negative,negative
Anxiety,14jvcv7,mum isn’t supportive of my anxiety and mental health,"
my mum is very close minded when it comes to mental health. i moved in with her when i was sixteen after leaving my dads and i learnt very early on that communicating openly about my mental health is not plausible. she believed that because i was now in a stable environment, the issues i was struggling with should automatically disappear. when they didn’t, she gave up on me. the whole two years i have been here i feel like i have been performing - pretending i am okay to make things easier for her. she cannot handle the fact i am in pain. she also believes that anxiety and depression can be cured by things like yoga and healthy eating, and that chemical imbalances don’t exist. i’ve tried to explain to her that practicing self care helps to alleviates my symptoms, but i still feel horribly depressed and anxious. she doesn’t get it. when i first moved in a therapist told me she suspects i have clinical depression and anxiety. when i told my mum, she made me leave that therapist and we never spoke of it again. 

i feel guilty when i talk about this because my mum did a very selfless thing when she let me live with her. she expresses love to me and has supported me greatly; but the way she handles my mental health and trauma has been terribly damaging. 

it’s gotten to the point where when i am at home i feel suffocated and my anxiety intensifies. i cannot keep up this mask, but if i am to tell her just how much pain i am in, it’ll wreak havoc and make the house even more uncomfortable. she’s also going through a hard time financially. i fear i’ll just be a burden on her. i am barely home anymore, i spend most days at my boyfriends house or just walking aimlessly outside, which helps me feel better, but is not sustainable as i can’t avoid my house forever. i also feel like i’m making my mum feel neglected as i tend to be out a lot. 

i’m going to university in September and am going to have to work most of the summer to save money for uni. i’ve suppressed my mental health to cater to my mum so severely that it’s manifested physically. i feel like i can barely function. i can’t imagine myself making it to the end of the summer. 

i don’t know how to express this to my mum. i’m scared she’ll see me as a problem, an affliction. all the times i have told her i am struggling, she shuts me down and i go back into pretending everything is fine so that i don’t upset her further. a few months ago my anxiety was so intense i genuinely thought i was going to die. my mum sensed i was struggling and told me i should go to the doctor and get anxiety medication. this was strange because she spent the past year and a half telling me to never go on medication for mental health, as again, she believes the cure for anxiety is pilates and salad. i feel like she caved in on anxiety medication because she’s given up with me, which is galling as that was the first time i was vulnerable with her about my mental health in over a year.

Anxiety,122m0wq,Regarding physical health - is there anyway to not jump to the worse case scenario?,"Hi, I have battled with anxiety for most if not all my 22 years of life and depression too. Recently since January I’ve been having leg/calf pain (the doctor THINKS it’s related to anxiety). And now my feet have been getting warm at night. All my blood test have come back normal. No one took me seriously until I showed pics of my feet when red and warm to the doc - only then I could see he believed me, before they said “it’s all in my head”. 

This isn’t about my physical health though - it’s about my mental health. It’s completely plummeted and as we know anxiety makes you jump to the worse case scenario and I’ve convinced myself I’m dying and this is it - I’ve stopped preparing for my final year at uni, I’ve started buying things for friends and family and I always cry myself to sleep, asking God for forgiveness. I don’t recognise myself, I’m in therapy and I’m so convinced it’s over for me I don’t even bother taking in what she’s saying.

Anxiety,14xkaez,Positive thread! Share your recent mental health victories!,"I'll share mine. Ten years ago I did my first self-unaliving attempt. God I was so deep down in my depression and anxiety, it physically hurt to be alive. I had nothing. I had no home, and the one I grew up in was incredibly toxic and unsafe. I lost all my friends. I had erratic and unstable relationships. I was addicted to substances and self harm. I had no hopes for the future, because all my plans had been flushed down the toilet and replaced by a dark limbo of pain.

Today I've got a steady job with decent pay, a long term partner, loyal friends, close connection to my family and I just got accepted into university. I live a life I never even thought would be possible to think about. 

I don't write this to brag. I write this to tell you that I've been lower than rock bottom. I had nothing. I had no one. I was my mental illness, it had full control over me. But slowly and surely, I took the baby steps needed to build my life from beyond scratch. Yes I still suffer from mental illness. But it doesn't rule me as it used to. 

If I can do it, so can you dear stranger. I know you can, because you are strong, beautiful, and independent. 

Let me read some of your recent victories! Whether it be that you managed to get out of bed or quit your shitty job. Let's share some joys!

Anxiety,12htep6,Health and Sleep Anxiety Woes (Trigger Warning),"Hey everyone. New member here. Only joined today.

I’m a 29 year old male, who’s just recently had to drop out of a university degree due to mental health problems.

I’m currently waiting to start therapy, but I need some advice, if possible, in the meantime.

I suffer from clinical depression, panic disorder, BPD and PTSD and I’m on 10mg Ecitalopram.

Most of these things are manageable, but my anxiety is out of control and I don’t know what to do.

I’ve learnt CBT in the past, but nothing is helping right now long term.

I’ll get moments of peace, then it’s back to square one again.

I’ve been getting really bad health and sleep anxiety, which I’ve had in the past, but not to this level.

The anxiety has made me feel physically unwell due to the stress and I keep thinking I’m going to die at any second.

Hot flushes, dizziness, feeling faint, diarrhoea, stomach issues, feverish, tension, chest pains, palpitations.

I’m also scared to sleep sometimes because I’ve now gotten anxious of losing consciousness.

Sometimes as I start to drift off, I jerk awake again and it feels horrible.

Racing heart, hot flushes and tension.

Sometimes it does it when I crash and start to get super relaxed.

I have slept, but I feel restless.

As soon as I wake up, I have to get up otherwise the anxiety takes over again.

Felt so drained today, that I kept dosing off and kept jolting awake as I started to dream.

Then I napped for half an hour, but had a proper deep sleep dream.

It was weird.

It’s driving me insane. I’ve been prescribed diazepam for 5 days, but I’m only trying to take it as a last resort.

I’ve just taken my third one out of a full pack.

I’ve been physically checked over multiple times, but I’m apparently very healthy.

Even had x-rays done.

I honestly don’t know how to deal with this anxiety anymore.

It’s stopping me from living my life properly.

Stuff that usually helps like watching movies, listening to music, gaming, reading, walking isn’t helping much.

I don’t have family nearby and my friends can only help to an extent.

I do have a support circle amongst them though.

It’s gotten so bad that I can’t work at the moment and have to apply for benefit.

Sorry for the ramble, but that’s the jist of it.

As pathetic as it sounds, I’m scared for the future.",1,2,hey everyone new member here only joined today i m a year old male who s just recently had to drop out of a university degree due to mental health problems i m currently waiting to start therapy but i need some advice if possible in the meantime i suffer from clinical depression panic disorder bpd and ptsd and i m on mg ecitalopram most of these things are manageable but my anxiety is out of control and i don t know what to do i ve learnt cbt in the past but nothing is helping right now long term i ll get moments of peace then it s back to square one again i ve been getting really bad health and sleep anxiety which i ve had in the past but not to this level the anxiety has made me feel physically unwell due to the stress and i keep thinking i m going to die at any second hot flushes dizziness feeling faint diarrhoea stomach issues feverish tension chest pains palpitations i m also scared to sleep sometimes because i ve now gotten anxious of losing consciousness sometimes as i start to drift off i jerk awake again and it feels horrible racing heart hot flushes and tension sometimes it does it when i crash and start to get super relaxed i have slept but i feel restless as soon as i wake up i have to get up otherwise the anxiety takes over again felt so drained today that i kept dosing off and kept jolting awake as i started to dream then i napped for half an hour but had a proper deep sleep dream it was weird it s driving me insane i ve been prescribed diazepam for days but i m only trying to take it as a last resort i ve just taken my third one out of a full pack i ve been physically checked over multiple times but i m apparently very healthy even had x rays done i honestly don t know how to deal with this anxiety anymore it s stopping me from living my life properly stuff that usually helps like watching movies listening to music gaming reading walking isn t helping much i don t have family nearby and my friends can only help to an extent i do have a support circle amongst them though it s gotten so bad that i can t work at the moment and have to apply for benefit sorry for the ramble but that s the jist of it as pathetic as it sounds i m scared for the future,-0.08321820023947683,-0.9954,NEGATIVE,0.9972923398017883,negative,negative,negative

Anxiety,v6r6bk,Death/health Anxiety is out of control,"Since my dad passed in June last year I have spiralled into a deep anxious depression. 3 months before he died I was made aware of my own impending doom

Have I foreseen my death?

I recently had a dream where I communicated with my grandmother who died in 1996

This is the 3rd time I feel like shes visited me in a dream.

This time I didn't see her (bar a shadow on the wall stood next to me)

In the dream I was communicating by asking her questions and she would answer yes or no by moving an object. I asked many questions, the most prominent one was when I would die.

I asked her to lift up a plate on my right hand when id listed off the year I was would pass.

2020....2021....2022...the plate lifts

Im gobsmacked and upset I ask her if its reversible, the communicates yes.

How I ask. suddenly the plate in my hand spins. every time it spins a new green vegetable appears.

Im a severely obese 35 year old male so this dream to me felt like a warning to lose weight

A couple of days later I had a nap and I dreamt I heard a voice saying 'Don't waste a minute'

This has made incredibly concerned that I might not have long left and whoever is watching over me is telling me to make the most of things. Its really had an adverse effect on my mental health the last couple of weeks

Ive been healthy eating since January 1st and im slowly losing weight.

But I just wonder if anyone else has experienced similar and wether anything actually transpired

Is this dream a bad omen? Its really stuck with me for the last year and the anxiety is getting worse the further we get into this year. Its currently completely consumed me and im feeling overwhelmed with anxiety of not being here anymore.

Its is just a product of grief having lost my father suddenly last year?

Anxiety,11ufo00,I've always had health anxiety. Then my little brother died of cancer at 29.,"I was a bag of grief for over a year after. I've come out of the fog, and though I still cry nearly daily for him, I could get back to life, until recently.

My health anxiety is through the roof. My newest thought today is that I have ovarian cancer because I've been bloated a lot over the last 3 weeks. However, I've also been taking iron pills and just got off antibiotics for a sinus infection.

My brother never had anxiety or worried too much about anything. Watching what happened to him has obviously left me with some serious trauma.

I feel unable to get through life the last 3 weeks, worse than while I was in serious grief. I can barely leave my bedroom because being anywhere else in my house amplifies my anxiety. I can feel every little pain or itch or nerve pinch. Every muscle spasm. My fitbit is both helping and not helping.

The only time I feel a bit better is when I walk a mile or two at a quick speed on my treadmill. But I just feel sooo incapable as a mother, a wife, a student, an auntie, a daughter.

And then when I try to convince myself it's just anxiety, my anxiety goes ""but what if it actually brain cancer(sinus infection), congestive heart failure (weird flu we got last week), breast cancer (pimple on my chest), or now ovarian cancer?""

I've never taken any prescription for mental health. I've coped with depression and anxiety my whole life but I finally feel incredibly overwhelmed and like the quality of my life is absolutely suffering. I cried into my husband's chest tonight and he was wholly supportive of me.

I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post. Solidarity? If anyone can relate?

Anxiety,11zp26d,Health anxiety is steering me towards a nervous breakdown,"My health anxiety is getting the best of me lately. Been having eye floaters the last few years and tinnitus so I was obsessing over a brain tumor. Then lately it turned into colon cancer and pancreatic cancer due to stomach issues. Now I woke up this morning and smelled burnt rubber or something similar to it and now I'm back to freaking out over a brain tumor because I couldn't figure out if it was real or not. I did have my bedroom window open which faces the parking lot of my apartment complex and I didn't smell the smell when I went into the other room but still it freaked me out and now I'm obsessing over that. No I'm not sick and don't have nor have had covid. I've seen two old neighbors of mine die from it within months and that's the root of my anxiety with it and now with this what I think was a phantom smell, I'm terrified. And now I can't tell if what I'm smelling is real or not. I came in from walking my dog and thought I smelled the burnt rubber again but it was just my coffee brewing. 

I literally feel like I'm at my wits end. I can't find a therapist due to time scheduling conflicts with my job. I was prescribed a medication by my PCP but I don't like how anti depressants affect my sex drive (the one thing that helps me cope with all of this). The health anxiety is just getting worse the older I get too (35 now). It sends me into deep depressions and I feel like it's ruining my life at this point. It's like I have a choice to either be medicated and impotent or keep spiraling mentally. I hate this. I hate my brain and that it thinks this way.

Anxiety,11tptlc,Can Anyone here with experience or knowledge regarding applying for disability for anxiety disorders/mental health in the states tell me if it’s worth a shot or based on my research just gonna b huge waste of time n energy?,"Tl;dr at the end below (got long sorry ;(


So I’ve been out of full time work for coming up on 5 years now. In these 5 years I’ve attempted 4 different times to hold down full time jobs that I applied for and was hired for and failed at all of them. I believe 3 weeks was the longest I made it at any of the 4 before I had to quit or was fired for missing days due to panic attacks and all the rest exc.

I had my monthly facetime checkup with my psych aprn who scripts my meds the other day and told him how horrible I’m doing (I’m currently in therapy again as well have been for 4 months trying IFS therapy) and he said he thinks I should def apply that the attempts at working look good in my favor exc. 

It’s just based on everything I’ve researched and heard even ppl with great documentation and severe illnesses exc get denied and somes appeals even eventually get denied as well. I also worry that since I’ve gone though so many therapists I only have one long term mental health professional I’ve been with and that’s him…this aprn I see who does my meds and I’ve been seeing for 8-9 years now. 

I mean maybe that’s good enuff since he can provide all the diagnoses and records of the million meds I’ve tried exc. I guess I can list out all the shrinks I’ve seen including my current one altho as far as them being able to actually talk to them if that’s even needed idk I mean some of them are from way back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Gad, SAD, cptsd, panic disorder, non specific depressive disorder and ocd so uhh ywah  I’m pretty Fkn bat shit lol and I’m def disabled I mean I’ve tried to work I want to work I don’t want a hand out but I’m desperate now. Savings are dwindling and while my older sister helps me out here and there knowing my situation with 100 bucks here 100 there which I feel so pathetic about but am grateful for but it’s just not enuff.

I don’t wanna be on disability forever but idk at the age of 33 after everything I’ve tried for so many goddamn years now I think I may be fooling myself holding on to any illusion of hope for a future for myself, and that includes ever being able to work a job again of any kind. I couldn’t even Fkn do a work from home job I was having panic attacks from being so overwhelmed logging on to my laptop in my own fucking living room for Christ sake.

Anyway I guess you didn’t need the whole life story sorry so basically just wondering if anybody here who is familar w the system or who has applied and been accepted or denied or whatever knows if it’s worth a shot.

Anxiety,23s9k5,[rant] We can see you in about a month! How the US mental health system is broken,"To anyone who manages mental health services in the United States: the system is wholly jacked and makes it far too difficult for someone who is already struggling with keeping themselves together to navigate this mess in a timely fashion. Let me illustrate:

General practitioners telling patients to call their insurance company to find out what coverage is available and get a list of potential doctors so they could make ANOTHER appointment to talk with their general practitioner again just to get a freakin referral or recommendation.

Once people get their referral and they call that DR's office they are told they have to wait a month or longer to actually see someone.

Appointments cannot be arranged by email? Really?!? How does that accommodate those who have telephone and social anxiety? Not to mention conjuring up the energy and courage to maintain that phone tag crap.

Even the definition of someone in crisis is a problem. Does a person really have to have gotten so far into their issues that they're contemplating suicide before we consider that person in crisis?!? What about someone who has disassociated and completely checked out?

Finally, there's an assumption that people seeking help in the US healthcare system can advocate for themselves but those suffering from anxiety and depression struggle with daily tasks, let alone intensely stressful tasks such as having to call multiple times just to reach a person making appointments.

Anxiety,13pj84n,"Health Anxiety, help!","Hello there.

&#x200B;

I was never able to udnerstand what happened to me four months ago and from that time I am anxious and have panic attacks about it. Now I am on Concor 2.5mg a day and feel okay, sometimes there's panic attack.

&#x200B;

Let me tell you why:

First, some muslce twiches happens randomly on my body. Then my mind will tell me: ""something is not right!"". Then, my brain says: ""Please, welcome this cold sweat!"". My heart says: ""Let me get hard working at around 125 BPM and let's the BP be 140/90!"". And I start a panic attack vicious cycle. Even on beta-blocker happens, because of the same symphoms but add an Palpitations to it.

&#x200B;

Trust me, it is hard. I know that it is hard, right now I am experiencing it in this stage of my life. If there is a cold morning and cold breeze, my brain will tell me that I will faint now and I have cold sweat and everything else. This is bad.

&#x200B;

One advice: Keep cool water or ice somewhere near you and when this happens splash your face with cold water or put ice on your face. It will take you back to relity almost immediately. Yeah, anxiety is a bitch, but we can beat her in her game.

&#x200B;

Do you remember when we was kids and when starting to play any game, we first observed how to paly it so we can beat it? Well, this is the same, but this time, the game is our mind/body, and to beat it, we need to understand it's game. But to tell you the trut I am unable to do it at 100%.

&#x200B;

Sometimes when I eat certain foods it will trigger the attack. And yes, there was two times that I felth cold sweat like I am gonna faint after eating only! I was been on a few doctors: Cardiologists and Gastroenterologists. Believe me, it was though! One day I called an ambulance because my BP was 180/120 and my HR was 140 after a palpitaion. I thought that I am having heart attack but it wasn't the case.

&#x200B;

Sometimes anxiety will start years before your first episode. My started 2 years ago. I am a married man, but from two and a half years ago I am not so happy. Then my palpitations started. I changed from the happy person I was to a half depressed guy. Why half you aks? Well, because I keep my feelings in me, which is BAD! They will start to gather in you and will eat you from inside, if they are not doing it right now already. So, these palpitations was not everytime observations and I didn't pay any attention to them. Researched a little bit and found that they are very common. Until before four months ago. Anxiety came with great panic attack, which changed me entirely.

&#x200B;

How I am now? Well, I feel like shit sometimes but I've never lost my smile and my sense of humour. But lately, when listening to music or movies that happens to give some memories back I start a little cry. Well, deppresion. Stage two! Stage one is anxiety.

&#x200B;

Now, Stage 3 is panic attacks! Well, they can be badass, trust me! They can mimic heart attacks, they can mimic also embolism, they can mimic GERD, well almost everything. What happens during them:

1. Your adrenal gland will create the so called ""Stress Cocktail"" Cortisol + Adrenaline. After Cortisol, the Adrenaline will be created and pushed into the blood stream. Then it will become Nor-adrenaline.
2. Adrenaline + Nor-Adrenaline is very, very bad hormone cocktail for your brain! Once is okay, twice is common, but after the third time, your brain is now high because of the hormone mixture. The brain needs more, so expect more panic attacks.
3. Once you cope with it and cut off panic attacks you will be stuck to muslce twiches or palp, or something else created by your brain, because he is missing his coctail. You are under the detoxication phase. But the brain will do almost anything to do it one more time.
4. Now you are back at square 1. You feel the urge need to see doctors and hospitals, because to be told that you are anxious is not enough when you feel that something else is in the equation. And again, and again.

So, only you can break the cycle but it will be ugly. Don't stop and move forward, it is the only way.

Start experimenting by changing your diet, walk instead of doing heavy intense trainings, get enough sleep, and experiment until your muscle twiches cease to exist or are at minimum. I also have sometime hands shaking, because of adrenaline but what I am doing? Well, I can start screaming or get really annoyed at this thing and start breaking things. Just you need to point that energy in you to something else. This is the only way my therapist said to me. She said: ""Don't try to control this power, but try to udnerstand it and try to use it!""

&#x200B;

Panic attacks in general are not life treating but rather they are pointing us that something in our life is not right and to change it. This is the way of our brains to say: ""It is time for you to change!"".

&#x200B;

So, when you feel the urge to go to a Doctor so you can lift that weight from your sholders - go for it, but don't over do it. If you feel the urge to not go outside of your house, don't do it, If you feel the urge to not speak - don't do it. It is a hard time for us all.

&#x200B;

I was on the moment in my life that every doctor said it was in my mind but my body is healthy. I didn't believe it and still don't. Then I found a woman with special abilities. When she saw me, she told me "" Something is not quite okay with you"". I automatically thought that that woman is referring to my health, but she said: ""Your aura is black. You are under negative emotions and need to charge yourself positively. There's nothing wrong with your body or health. Your mental health is not okay. Everything is in your mind."" 

&#x200B;

So I searched for doctors, nobody found anything. Then I searched what if someone cursed me or something like that. Then I searched for people with abillities to tell you what happened. Well, that woman told me the same thing my cardiologist told me:

1. Lose 15 kilograms.
2. Walk, walk, walk.
3. Try to cope with the anxiety.
4. Take a beta-blocker until ready to control yourself and accept anxiety as part of you.
5. Trow away the beta-blocker and live you life.
6. Go to positive places to charge yoursself.

If you don't have any heart condition, or any other illness, then it is you mind. I know the following:

""Imagination and self talk are the most powerful thing in this life. If you imagine yourself that you are lonely person, but actually you have family, kids, parents and so on, you will become a lonely person. If you  imagine yourself to be bad guy, you will be bad one day, because your mind will change.""

&#x200B;

Imagination and self talk are powerful, don't underestimate them at any cost!

&#x200B;

Anxiety,rw7gbe,Bad Health Anxiety,"Really been going through it today. A year ago my dad got bypass surgery. About 2 months ago my anxiety started peaking. I started getting lightheaded and dizzy very frequently, I would get palpitations, been having chest pains, and I immediately jumped to thoughts that my heart is failing. About a month ago I got let go from my job and started getting several panic attacks a week. And of course my symptoms for panic attacks are as if I was having a heart attack.

I've been to a cardiologist and gotten checked up, and I have a stress test scheduled coming up. But my dizziness is excessive and bad lately. I know I could try exercising, I've been basically laying in bed for the past month which is terrible for my mental and physical health. The past couple days have been so dizzy it makes it hard to walk, coupled with varingy chest pains, back pains, and other physical symptoms I have. In the past couple years I went from an avid hiker and someone who likes to go out to someone that depersonalizes frequently even going for a simple walk and has had real issues getting out of bed. I'm worried that my mental health has gotten so bad it's affecting my physical health....which exacerbates everything. I'm also worried that what if this isn't anxiety and it's more, and the doctors just keep missing stuff?

I realize posting this is probably more for me than it is anything else. I need to seek therapy, and I'm trying to find a therapist. I was recently prescribed anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication for the first time. One of the pills doesn't work terribly well and it felt awful and I'm stopping that per the doctor, and I've yet to start the other one. I feel like I'm getting locked in, this is getting bad and interfering with who I am and what I like to do. I'm actively trying to do stuff to improve my situation, such as call doctors and make appointments, follow up... but I can't stop worrying and being anxious about my health, the state of the world, my inability to stay employed, etc etc blah blah blah. I feel like I'm the boy who cried wolf when I go get checkups. I feel like I'm a burden on my relationship and that I've started losing people close to me. I'm exhausted, and I want to take back what my life used to be..

There's no proper way to wrap this up so I'm just going to say thanks for reading. If you feel so inclined to offer any suggestions on how to self-managing anxiety, feel free because I'm willing to try stuff. In the meantime I'll keep looking for a therapist and try not to freak out 🙃",3,12,really been going through it today a year ago my dad got bypass surgery about months ago my anxiety started peaking i started getting lightheaded and dizzy very frequently i would get palpitations been having chest pains and i immediately jumped to thoughts that my heart is failing about a month ago i got let go from my job and started getting several panic attacks a week and of course my symptoms for panic attacks are as if i was having a heart attack i've been to a cardiologist and gotten checked up and i have a stress test scheduled coming up but my dizziness is excessive and bad lately i know i could try exercising i've been basically laying in bed for the past month which is terrible for my mental and physical health the past couple days have been so dizzy it makes it hard to walk coupled with varingy chest pains back pains and other physical symptoms i have in the past couple years i went from an avid hiker and someone who likes to go out to someone that depersonalizes frequently even going for a simple walk and has had real issues getting out of bed i'm worried that my mental health has gotten so bad it's affecting my physical health which exacerbates everything i'm also worried that what if this isn't anxiety and it's more and the doctors just keep missing stuff i realize posting this is probably more for me than it is anything else i need to seek therapy and i'm trying to find a therapist i was recently prescribed anti anxiety and anti depressant medication for the first time one of the pills doesn't work terribly well and it felt awful and i'm stopping that per the doctor and i've yet to start the other one i feel like i'm getting locked in this is getting bad and interfering with who i am and what i like to do i'm actively trying to do stuff to improve my situation such as call doctors and make appointments follow up but i can't stop worrying and being anxious about my health the state of the world my inability to stay employed etc etc blah blah blah i feel like i'm the boy who cried wolf when i go get checkups i feel like i'm a burden on my relationship and that i've started losing people close to me i'm exhausted and i want to take back what my life used to be there's no proper way to wrap this up so i'm just going to say thanks for reading if you feel so inclined to offer any suggestions on how to self managing anxiety feel free because i'm willing to try stuff in the meantime i'll keep looking for a therapist and try not to freak out,-0.12548780487804878,-0.994,NEGATIVE,0.9990465044975281,negative,negative,negative

Hi everyone, I currently work in the beauty industry and have a really hard time struggling with severe anxiety and panic disorder as well as depression. Last month, things got really bad and I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, resulting in me taking one day off work to recover, then another day, then a whole week. I went back in on Tuesday just for a quick trial day and it ended up going okay, not horribly but I did have a panic attack half way through and ended up leaving an hour early. Tomorrow I’m going back for a full 5 days in a row and even though I’m doing much better and thought I was ready, the thought of going in tomorrow and for the rest of the week is making me so panicky and I can’t stop crying :( I can’t keep taking time off work to sit on the couch I need to go to work and I also can’t cancel because I work with clients and cancelling on them can mess up my whole career (definitely not helping with the stress part.) I really do love what I do I just wish my anxiety wasn’t always getting in the way. Does anyone have experience with how to cope with this? I’m working with a therapist as well but I’m not seeing her again until next week.",2,2,f hi everyone i currently work in the beauty industry and have a really hard time struggling with severe anxiety and panic disorder as well as depression last month things got really bad and i had the worst panic attack i ve ever had resulting in me taking one day off work to recover then another day then a whole week i went back in on tuesday just for a quick trial day and it ended up going okay not horribly but i did have a panic attack half way through and ended up leaving an hour early tomorrow i m going back for a full days in a row and even though i m doing much better and thought i was ready the thought of going in tomorrow and for the rest of the week is making me so panicky and i can t stop crying i can t keep taking time off work to sit on the couch i need to go to work and i also can t cancel because i work with clients and cancelling on them can mess up my whole career definitely not helping with the stress part i really do love what i do i just wish my anxiety wasn t always getting in the way does anyone have experience with how to cope with this i m working with a therapist as well but i m not seeing her again until next week,0.03863636363636364,-0.9706,NEGATIVE,0.9925001263618469,neutral,negative,negative
Anxiety,121vig8,Mental health and your body,"Halo halo!

I have a question for all the people who struggle with depression and anxiety disorder: do you have any physical symptoms of your problems?

Like... I know about IBS. I know it too well actually.

But... can it also affect like your bones/joints? My joints, especially in my hips and arms crack terribly. Usually when I exercise. It does not hurt. I think it's because i am extremely tense all the time and I strain my body for no reason... even during very light work out. The same with my jaw.  I tend to clench my teeth while sleeping.

I swear there are so many little issues here and there that sometimes I feel like I'm slowly decomposing, like if my body was lowkey shutting down.  
Is there a possibility that antidepressants will help?

Anxiety,3niomg,"Mental health outcomes need to be re-branded as something that can be beaten, just like cancer.","I was wondering if any of you have recommendations for foundations, charities, youtube channels, or whatever sorts of groups you know of for mental health advocacy, policy, etc.

Cancer is branded as something that can be beaten, even though most of the time the outcome is not so good. There are innumerable inspirational stories of people overcoming cancer, even the majority lose that battle. Mental health problems are battles, too, but they are often seen as lifelong battles (which they often are, of course), but that's, well, depressing. 

Cancer is depressing; people re-brand it as something to be overcome. Mental health issues need the same treatment in order to increase awareness and move towards more positive public opinions. The benefits of the reduced stigma would be enormous.

We need this for mental health outcomes. Even in the field of mental health, everyone can seem melancholy as though you'll never really get better. There's rarely a ""now go! you're all better now!"" moment. We're always left with the fear of our own minds, and we need a way out of it.

Anxiety,qhsdf9,"I've had mental health issues since I was 5 & can't remember a time without. I don't know if recovery is possible, because I don't know what normal feels like. I don't know what to do. Has anyone else had mental health issues since they were a very young kid (e.g 4-6 years old)? (Trigger warning)"," I'm in my 20's, and I was formally diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and depression a couple of years, but I've had it since I was 4 or 5 years old. My parents first took me to the doctors as a kid (aged 6) because I was having very dark, intrusive thoughts worrying that me or my family would come to harm, if I didn't perform certain actions or rituals. At the same time, I also had developed a huge fear of choking, and would refuse to eat in school or places I felt unsafe, because I was convinced that I would choke and die. To this day, I still struggle massively with eating and fear of choking, and it's been so bad the last couple of months I have had to chew up my food into microscopic pieces so that I can swallow and at some points consume only liquids. I digress, I was put into therapy (aged 6) where I remember drawing pictures and colouring in, so I believe I was just prescribed a form of art therapy with the school counsellor. I didn't really open up to the therapist, because the other kids in my class kept asking me why I was taken out of class and why I had to visit the school counsellor. I didn't feel normal because of this, so I felt ashamed and I shut down and didn't speak. That therapy didn't do much, because the obsessive and compulsive thoughts returned. Then, I was hyper focused on my health, to the point at 9 years old I convinced myself I had breast cancer (after a family member was diagnosed). I was so worried that I asked my parents to go to the doctor because my chest 'hurt' (from poking and checking my chest), because I was convinced I had breast cancer too and I could die. I didn't divulge the fears of breast cancer, I just said that my chest hurt, because I wanted the doctor to tell me I was okay.

These problems have just got worse and worse. I have had terrible and daily intrusive thoughts during my childhood and teenage years, and was certain in my teens that I must be crazy and not 'normal'. However, now, I am hyper focused on my swallowing and my breathing, and these processes have turned from unconscious to conscious, and the focus on my swallowing has caused me to lose weight. I get incredibly worried about my health too, and my health anxiety is the main issue at the moment. I check my blood pressure, oxygen saturation, my urine (with test sticks), my heart rate, my body for any signs of disease e.g lumps and bumps. I used to spend 6-10 hours a day of engaging in reassurance seeking behaviours. I used to check my vitals 100-200 times a day combined, because I was worried I would become unwell or get a life-ending illness.

I don't remember a time that I felt normal. I don't remember a time where I wasn't mentally unwell. My aunt had OCD, but it developed in her 40's, and I felt somewhat envious, because she knew that 'normality' was possible for her. She knew what life was like \*before\*, during and after suffering with debilitating mental illness. Now, she's better, and I am glad about that. But, part of me, deep down wants that healing for myself, but it doesn't seem possible. I don't know what my life would look like without mental illness, because my first memories in life are tainted by it. I don't have a \*before\* or \*after\* mental health picture to look at.

Anxiety,117jve6,"If you swap the words ""mental"" with ""emotional"" in regard to health things make a lot more sense","I've grown to not like the phrase ""mental health"", and as I've developed a better understanding over my own issues I've come to realize that most if not all of it is emotional health and unresolved childhood traumas. Me and most of my friends are ""on the spectrum"", and most of them have similar life experiences to mine in regard to how we grew up.

I grew up abused physically and emotionally as a child, I was beaten and called worthless by one of my parents. I used fiction and entertainment as escapism due to my lack of genuine friends and self inserted myself into the worlds of fiction I love. This is ultimately how I became a furry and the furry community is made up almost entirely of ""neurodivergents"". I wanted to escape real life and exist in the fictional world where I felt happy and welcome, in the real world I felt foreign and alien.

Mental health implies you were born this way and since your brain is wired this way you have no hope of curing it, you just have to accept this is the way you are and you gotta take meds to make life easier to handle. I never liked the idea of meds, my mom wanted me to get some but I refused. I didn't want to grow dependent on them, I didn't like the idea of needing them to function so I tried understanding why I think the way I do and how I got this way.

From childhood to my early 20s I had ""social anxiety disorder"", I was very shy and so deathly afraid of social interaction that even walking by someone on the sidewalk felt intense. I couldn't drive or get a job, crossing the street and talking to a cashier was incredibly uncomfortable to me. I thought I was going to be like this forever, I thought this ""disorder"" was who I was and I had to live with it or stop living.

Well, eventually I cured myself of it. I realized that I was not the center of attention, that nobody had me in their minds and nobody was judging me. All of the thoughts I thought people were thinking about me were in my own head not theirs, people couldn't care less who I was or what I was doing, they were in their own heads worrying about their own issues. I was socially anxious because I was lonely and couldn't relate to anyone, I thought everyone saw me as weird but if I see someone weird I don't remember them or probably ever see them again. Now I can drive, now I can talk to people, now I smile in public and greet people and talk normally and don't hide, no meds or therapy required.

So to conclude, outside of crippling disabilities people are born with like low functioning autism or similar disabilities, your issues are not mental, they're emotional and they can be healed. Don't take health advice from people trying to sell you pills, you can overcome the anxiety and the depression, just trace it back to the source and resolve that unresolved trauma.",2,1,i've grown to not like the phrase mental health and as i've developed a better understanding over my own issues i've come to realize that most if not all of it is emotional health and unresolved childhood traumas me and most of my friends are on the spectrum and most of them have similar life experiences to mine in regard to how we grew up i grew up abused physically and emotionally as a child i was beaten and called worthless by one of my parents i used fiction and entertainment as escapism due to my lack of genuine friends and self inserted myself into the worlds of fiction i love this is ultimately how i became a furry and the furry community is made up almost entirely of neurodivergents i wanted to escape real life and exist in the fictional world where i felt happy and welcome in the real world i felt foreign and alien mental health implies you were born this way and since your brain is wired this way you have no hope of curing it you just have to accept this is the way you are and you gotta take meds to make life easier to handle i never liked the idea of meds my mom wanted me to get some but i refused i didn't want to grow dependent on them i didn't like the idea of needing them to function so i tried understanding why i think the way i do and how i got this way from childhood to my early s i had social anxiety disorder i was very shy and so deathly afraid of social interaction that even walking by someone on the sidewalk felt intense i couldn't drive or get a job crossing the street and talking to a cashier was incredibly uncomfortable to me i thought i was going to be like this forever i thought this disorder was who i was and i had to live with it or stop living well eventually i cured myself of it i realized that i was not the center of attention that nobody had me in their minds and nobody was judging me all of the thoughts i thought people were thinking about me were in my own head not theirs people couldn't care less who i was or what i was doing they were in their own heads worrying about their own issues i was socially anxious because i was lonely and couldn't relate to anyone i thought everyone saw me as weird but if i see someone weird i don't remember them or probably ever see them again now i can drive now i can talk to people now i smile in public and greet people and talk normally and don't hide no meds or therapy required so to conclude outside of crippling disabilities people are born with like low functioning autism or similar disabilities your issues are not mental they're emotional and they can be healed don't take health advice from people trying to sell you pills you can overcome the anxiety and the depression just trace it back to the source and resolve that unresolved trauma,0.062237762237762236,-0.9893,NEGATIVE,0.9932653903961182,positive,negative,negative
Anxiety,125ahwv,Retail vs. Pub Job and Mental Health,"Hello, 26[F] from London, UK. I'm interviewing for two jobs this week. One with a retail store and one with a pub but I'm trying to decide which I'd be best suited to. My previous job history was working in an art gallery, doing social media and ambassadorships at university.


I've been out of proper employment for about 5 years due to my poor mental health. I'm bipolar type one with treatment resistant depression and I suffer from anxiety disorders as well as agoraphobia. So I've known I'm not very reliable when it comes to mind mood if I'm in a bad way. I'm doing a bit better now and really need some work.


The retail job is low pressure but I'd have to commute to central London which makes me very anxious as I have a particular anxiety around travel. But the pub job is more local but it could be subject to a higher pressure environment. And more difficult customers. 


In an ideal world I would choose retail locally but that's not an option. So I was wondering which would serve me best given my condition. A friend mentioned that I'd meet a lot of people at the pub which is a plus for me as that's also part of my motivation for working is to make friends. I know people say that retail is the worst but this is a higher end company that also sells home goods. So it's not as stressful as somewhere like Primark for example.


I was also wondering, which environment is best for if I'm having a bad day or something. talking to my therapist she said she'd be fine with someone not all happy and smiley at the pub as long as the service is good. but in retail I don't know if I could get away with that.


Thanks if you've read this far and have any advice for me.

Anxiety,11wexvw,Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out. Need support.,"Hey all, 
For context I’m 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn’t have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I’ve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I’d push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It’s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I’ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I’ve been under, there’s also been physical and health issues I’ve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don’t want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",2,0,hey all for context i m f and in week of l so have just started law school however these past three years but specifically last year was so hard on me on top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died days before my first exam these exams were the ones that dictated whether or not i d get into university for some background my grandpa was like my father to me when i was younger especially my dad wasn t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so i wouldn t see him as a result my grandparents looked after me and i spent countless hours with them and still see my grandma every week as you can imagine his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard but i had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground i went into school no literally minutes after the burial i had to go to school for final exam prep anyways this was in november of i got through exams and for the first time in what felt like forever i felt happy at christmas my mind was clear i was surrounded by family and didn t have any responsibilities i even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where i got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers so i had a brief intermission of calm i was happy for about weeks till about february this year until it all came rushing back anxiety panic attacks derealization just like that put back on mg of lexapro which i ve been on for just under weeks the trigger possibly university being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse but i decided i d push through and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers it s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died exhaustion unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything i ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks i need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal besides the mental strain i ve been under there s also been physical and health issues i ve been dealing with being hyperthyroidism and as of a week ago iron deficiency seems like my body wants me to stop but i don t want to studying gives me a sense of purpose of validation i guess all i ask for is for some advice please this is a big decision for me and i really just want someone to talk to and hear me thank you in advance,0.0010666666666666713,-0.9413,NEGATIVE,0.9839211702346802,neutral,negative,negative
Anxiety,n60not,should I take the summer off to better my mental health?,"Hey everyone. Ive been going through a really rough 3 months with some severe depression and anxiety, especially depression. I have had MDD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years. Both of which are really bad. I took off the fall semester from school hoping I would get better and just worked, and then planned to return to school for the winter term. I tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that I unrolled from all of my classes, quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents. 

We thought things would have gotten better by now, but they’re only seeming to get worse. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high where I can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy. I feel like I can cry for hours which never used to happen. My anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with Xanax until my antidepressants start helping. 

So far in my life I’ve been on 8 different antidepressants and none have worked very well. I have just come off of Lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell. Now I’ve started taking both Wellbutrin and Sertraline, which I’m trying for a second time. 

I’m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy, I was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two, so I’m now talking to her twice a week. 

I’m having a really hard time if I should work this summer, so from when lockdown ends until end of August when I’ll move back to school. Or if I should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better. I have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me. So the money aspect isn’t a huge issue. The only part I’m struggling with is at the current summer job I have, I’m guaranteed full-time hours this year and get 3 days doing the job that pays the most in tips, and I’m concerned that if I take a year off I won’t get that next year. I’m just having a really difficult time deciding. 

I also do feel suicidal every day but not to the point where I figure out a plan to do it, more just wishing it was something I was brave enough to do & then hating myself for having those thoughts. 

Any advice would help, thank you.",9,14,hey everyone ive been going through a really rough months with some severe depression and anxiety especially depression i have had mdd and generalized anxiety disorder for years both of which are really bad i took off the fall semester from school hoping i would get better and just worked and then planned to return to school for the winter term i tried a bit but my mental health got so terrible to the point that i unrolled from all of my classes quit my job at school and moved back home with my parents we thought things would have gotten better by now but they re only seeming to get worse my depression and anxiety are at an all time high where i can barely get out of bed any day or do anything that requires remotely any energy i feel like i can cry for hours which never used to happen my anxiety attacks are almost daily now and my doctor has prescribed me with xanax until my antidepressants start helping so far in my life i ve been on different antidepressants and none have worked very well i have just come off of lexapro because it made me feel like a robot and then my doctor took me through two weeks without any meds which was hell now i ve started taking both wellbutrin and sertraline which i m trying for a second time i m also working with a clinical psychologist using cognitive behavioural therapy i was originally seeing her once a week but after she talked to me yesterday she thinks we should bump it up to two so i m now talking to her twice a week i m having a really hard time if i should work this summer so from when lockdown ends until end of august when i ll move back to school or if i should take the summer off to really focus on me and getting better i have money saved up and my parents are able to help support me so the money aspect isn t a huge issue the only part i m struggling with is at the current summer job i have i m guaranteed full time hours this year and get days doing the job that pays the most in tips and i m concerned that if i take a year off i won t get that next year i m just having a really difficult time deciding i also do feel suicidal every day but not to the point where i figure out a plan to do it more just wishing it was something i was brave enough to do then hating myself for having those thoughts any advice would help thank you,0.07186274509803922,-0.8023,NEGATIVE,0.9993337988853455,positive,negative,negative
Anxiety,10rvevd,Coping with health anxiety when you have a real health issue?,"I've had health anxiety since I was a kid. It flares up during certain times of my life. Typically, I'm afraid of cancer or becoming seriously ill. My dad developed terminal cancer when I was 24 and I had to take care of him by myself so he could die at home. I knew he had cancer from his symptoms and it took a lot of fighting with medical professionals to get them to help him. A few years later in 2019, I became critically ill for about a year and was not diagnosed with my disease quickly enough and ended up in ICU. I was lucky to be diagnosed just in time and lived to talk about it but the ordeal left me with some post traumatic stress. While I was undiagnosed, I was told I have anxiety, an eating disorder, depression, etc. Nobody seemed to be taking me seriously and I was truly dying. Needless to say, these experiences have left me with pretty severe health anxiety. I am 4 months postpartum and as soon as I was in the hospital, my health anxiety spiraled out of control. I was in the ER 3 times after the birth. For most of those, they weren't truly necessary and could have been outpatient visits but I could not stifle my terror at the idea of something being wrong and I am COMPLETELY intolerant of uncertainty. I'm going through health issues right now that I'm in the process of getting figured out and having to wait weeks for appointments is absolutely wrecking my mental health. I see a psychiatrist once week and attend a group therapy once a week for postpartum depression and anxiety. I am on SSRIs and on short term use of anxiety meds but will have to phase those out soon. What do I do in the meantime while waiting for this health issue to get addressed?? I cannot stop compulsively checking my arms (which are covered in painful and swollen lymph nodes) and focusing on the pains in my arm. I have had 1 ultrasound on a lymph node that appeared benign but I have so many all over my biceps that hurt and I know this is not normal. I have another ultrasound on lymph nodes on 02/17 and I see a hematologist on 04/10 because my CBC showed some high lymphocytes. I am terrified the pain and lymph nodes mean I have some form of cancer.

I can't stop touching these lymph nodes and spiraling into a panic attack. I cry every day and I'm miserable. I was also Googling constantly, even while I was feeding my baby I was doing it, but I have done well the past few days and haven't looked up anything medical-related. I'm really trying my best here but I feel like my life is over. I feel like these appointments are taking too long and that the cancer is spreading as I sit here waiting. I'm worried that if I DON'T go to the ER, or Google, or do SOMETHING that keeps me engaged with this health issue, then the worst case scenario WILL happen. It will be something deadly and the doctors will not have taken me seriously and I didn't fight hard enough and it will be my fault and I'll die. I feel stupid and dramatic but it feels realistic for me.

It doesn't help that I moved to a new state right before I gave birth and I have no family or friends anywhere near me and I spend all day alone with my baby, freaking out, crying in my apartment and fighting the urge to palpate my body and Google.

Anxiety,qvdmie,Those who claim to be advocates for mental health are likely spreading dangerous misinformation.,"Nowadays, everyone claims to be an advocate for mental health. They encourage those with mental health issues to speak up, tell someone and to feel empowered and less shameful. 

The real issue comes from those who have had zero experience with mental health issues, meaning they’ve never experienced depression, anxiety or any symptom. These people can be quite ignorant and downplay your problems. They can also spread information that can outright dangerous or offensive because of their lack of understanding.

For example, I have pretty moderate anxiety. This individual had told me to start taking my ativan every day. Oh thanks, I’m cured!!... Excuse me? that is quite dangerous to tell somebody. You are basically setting them up for a dependancy/addiction. You cannot take ativan everyday! Yes, it will solve the problem.. but at a cost.

I have a real problem with these people, they never understand. It is best to confide in somebody who has the mental health issue that you personally have.

This all leads to the content of this post, where I am; an update:

---

**TLDR:** After trying a number of medications, I seem to have found a set that are starting to give me some hope that I might be able to change course with regards to my anxiety, lack of focus, and (in my internal view) failure at life.

I still have a lot I need to do, and next on this list past medication is probably some sort of exposure therapy with a psychologist. I feel it will be difficult to find a good psychologist and have tried a few times below (with anecdotes below as well) but I feel the potential return on investment is too great for me not to give it yet another try.

---

**Full Post:**

I have actually recently had a bit of a breakthrough with anxiety, though from reading online it's sure to be short lived if I don't find a long term medication and or solution.

Currently, I've been prescribed a few things from my Psychiatrist, not all at the same time (I got the first 2 before the third one).

First is Clonazepam, which is a Benzodiazepine. It's been great because basically from day one I noticed my anxiety in my work meetings reduce significantly. Over time it's seemed to get even better. Of course as a Benzodiazepine the big worry is that it doesn't take long for tolerance to build up, and the withdrawal symptoms seem terrifying on paper, so Ideally I think the hope is that the next medication on the list that takes longer to start working solves the issue for the long term so I can come off of the Clonazepam sooner rather than later, especially because its a schedule IV drug, which while legal because its been prescribed by a doctor to me for treatment of illness, still feels risky given you can get into trouble if someone else takes some off you etc etc. That being said, its effect started off mild and then became almost magical. Today after a scrum meeting I didnt go to lie down for half an hour. I needed no time to recover. I started back working basically right away. Before this, I had gotten to the point where I would say my piece and then lie down under my bed because hearing other people talk about their accomplishments from the previous day would make my anxiety more severe and this little dose of Clonazepam seems to have been enough to eliminate that. Its crazy.

I still have some anxiety, serious anxiety even, but I don't feel like suddenly quitting my job anymore.

The second drug is Escitalopram. This is a pretty typical SSRI, and since I've only been on it for a week, I can't say too much. At least in the 1 week I've been on it though, I haven't yet had a complete loss of function in my penis. I still seem able to get off, while my erection isn't as hard as it typically is, it's still functional, and while it feels a little bit desensitized (which is a bit of a problem for me because I've always been on the longer side of time to finish). Another side effect it has had is pretty extreme insomnia, where I've been having a hard time falling asleep, only to wake up again not long after getting around 2-3 hours of sleep the past few days. I've been advised to perhaps have it in the morning instead and so I'll see if that works. I think it so far, it has been bearable otherwise. I really hope it works to help with some of the OCD tendencies I've started to build up I assume due to the anxiety. I also hope it works for the anxiety, but I'll have to wait a few more weeks to really see if it's helping. Hopefully it helps the depression too.

The last drug is probably going to be the biggest, and that's Adderall XR. I actually held off for a few weeks even though my Psychiatrist offered it earlier because I was so afraid of the side effects, addiction, tolerance problems etc, but thus far, on my very meager dosage, it seems just fine. I actually don't notice much with the 10mg he started me off on (he wanted to start at 20, but I was afraid so we started low). I notice no heart rate increase, no headache, no notable mood changes (maybe slightly less depressed and gloomy but that's probably the anxiety), no dizziness or headache, and only a little bit of appetite loss, but I'm a big guy so that's actually a really positive benefit. I out of curiosity after having had it for a few days and noticing nothing decided to double up my dosage to the 20 he had wanted to put me on before, and I can say it seems to already have started to work. I imagine I could still use a higher dosage still as the effect is very mild and I still have many issues, but I feel like I'm seeing real effects already with my ability to stay on task. I'm clearly not there yet, but I'm starting to be confident that this might be a great long term solution for me given that serious tolerance issues appear to usually take years to build up.

I still haven't been diagnosed with anything, which worries me because I fear that if I for some reason lose connection with them, I'll need to start the process all over and have an abrupt stoppage, but at least right now its looking good.

Maybe the Clonazepam saved me from the side effects, maybe its just really compatible with me, or maybe its the light dosage, but it seems fine so far and I only have hopes it'll get even better. The psychiatrist has suggested I see them every 2 weeks to increase the dosage until I hit 50mg, or start running into side effects I can't manage.

I'm currently shopping around looking for a psychologist to hopefully accompany my medication as well and help me with both my anxiety, avoidance (nearly agoraphobia), social issues likely partially caused by that etc. Im looking at various profiles on different websites to try to figure out who I should contact first. I've had some bad experiences in the past with psychologists so I'm pretty hesitant and picky.

* I've had a psychologist who seemed nice but due to government program restrictions I could only see 6 times, which was useless.

* I've had a psychologist who told me I was ""a completely fucked up human being"", which had me in tears and a deeeeeeeeep depression for weeks (I think she thought that was tough love or some nonsense, but it was really unprofessional and damaging and in hindsight I should have reported her).

* I've had a psychologist who I didnt last long with just because their buildings smelled awful, and like it had mold, the place looked like a mess and their furniture was old and ripped apart.

* I've even had a psychologist who tried to push religion on me, which was not cool at all and I noped right out of that situation.

It's really hard to know what you are going to get, and when I know my insurance will (I believe) only cover the first 1000 bucks per year, leaving me to probably pay thousands for this, it's a hard pill to swallow given how much I expect to have to shop around.

I'm still going to try it again though, and maybe my being more picky this time will pay off. I think ultimately if I find one that works, even if I have to spend 10,000 dollars to fix my issues it'll be worth it.

A few months ago my prognosis on life was dim. Like one bad event or bad enough day from being over dim.

Right now, Its still dim, dark even, but I at least see a potential path to success (fulfillment and happiness) again. The destination still looks extremely far away, like years away even, but at least I see it; A chance to fix my life so that I can maybe enjoy the last 2/3rds even if the first 1/3rd has been horrible.

I (19M) have been this january diagnosed with GAD. I have been struggling with anxiety for my whole life, but since november last year it took a huge toll on me. 

I am a college freshman and I am studying in a foreign country. Since getting here I had severe social anxiety and it was pretty hard to make friends. 

In november last year was the first time in my life that I experienced depersonalization and derealization. When it started I also experienced a severe brain fog: I could barely think, hold a conversation, nevertheless study. 

I worried a lot about my symptoms and I developed an obsession around the fear of developing schizophrenia. It got to the point where I was hyper aware of my own thoughts and basically everything I was thinking about was questionable and possibly a sign of developing psychosis. I also had terrible physical symptoms besides the dpdr. 

Since I was diagnosed I started medication (sertraline) and therapy. For the past few months I got much better and I started to pick up on my college work.

I developed however pretty debilitating relationship anxiety. I am in a relationship since February with this amazing girl and for the past weeks I am continuously worrying about losing her. I am making fake scenarios in my head about every little detail that may be a sign of she cheating or losing interest. I am talking about pathetic stuff like not answering my texts or things like that. And while I make these scenarios I start worrying that I am going insane because of them. I also have some depression but I think it is a direct consequence of my anxiety. Whenever I get into these low moods it is always related to losing her. 

I never committed any type of self harm but I have a lot of suicidal thoughts lately, whenever I make these scenarios. 

I am aware that I am extremely attached to this person and I hate to be so vulnerable around someone. But I am so scared of losing her. I usually do not tell her about my fears because I don't want to look clingy and I know reassurance seeking is not healthy, but sometimes it becomes impossible to hold everything in me and I do maybe minor stuff like ask her if she s ok many times and then I worry that I look weak in her eyes and that she s starting to realize I m a pathetic loser and not who she thinks I am.

Anxiety,109dc2a,"Mental health impacting job search, need to decide path forward","Hi everyone. I'm struggling with a major job / life decision and I would love advice. 

I have a background in chemistry but have been working an HR consulting job for 2 years. I hate it, and I'm trying to explore careers in health research. However, I've been feeling ""stuck"" in anxiety and depression. I've struggled with my mental health for about 10 years now, but it's been really flaring up these past 6 months. 

I feel so shitty, I know that it would be best for me to keep working and apply to jobs but I have made no headway on my applications in over a year. I'm usually very proactive and motivated, and I know the steps I have to take to apply, but I keep avoiding applications and job searching. If I could ""just do it,"" I would have already. I have been feeling stuck, disempowered, self-critical, hopeless, and just restless about my career and future. I need to make a change. I've been saving up money, and I want to either move out of my parents' (I moved from California back to Illinois a year ago) or quit my job. 

**If I keep my current consulting job, I'll transfer to the Los Angeles office.** I want to do this, but I'm afraid I won't make any forward movement with my career change. I think it would be nice to have my own space, but I'm afraid I will feel tired and lonely and sad. I think the LA office will have a stronger community, and I'm optimistic about having stabile work while I search. But I do hate my job, and it is exhausting, and logistically I won't be able to put a lot of energy towards a career change. 

**If I quit my job, I'll travel for a few months.** I feel like I ""should"" value this, but I'm afraid that having a complete lack of structure and direction may lead to me spiraling out in depression. I'm anxious about doing the ""wrong"" thing by quitting my job without having something lined up. I might be anxious and worried the entire time I'm traveling and I might get burnt out and even more self-critical searching for a new job. However, some space could allow me to figure out what actually matters to me. I could take a genuine break. I could be excited and happy. And I might be able to get an awesome new job quickly, in a place I want to live. 

When I talk to my family about this, they don't really factor in how much my mental health will impact my functionality. My mom told me to just apply to more jobs faster, and to just ""commit,"" but when I am stuck in depression and feel like everything is meaningless, and I'm worthless, and I'll never get a job, then I can't really bring myself to apply.

Anxiety,yoi8om,Mental health in relation to how good your life situation is,"Here is a thought I have been thinking about lately. I used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation - if you don't have friends, no job, don't have hobby's, don't have money, don't have a partner, have a poor family situation,.. it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression. However, recently I had a thought that that might not be quite the truth. I think what could be the real problem, leading to mental health disorders, is that it's not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems, nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life, it's that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck. I mean that, you don't find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on, so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation, leading to worry and anxiety/depression. And so it's not per se your life situation quality, or the fact that you are stuck, but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble.

For example, if someone with a mental health disorder, takes a long vacation, that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation, but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere.

As another example, there are people with a decent life situation: good financial situation, kids, good relationships,.. but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area, and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life, and starts to absorb all their thinking. It's like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody.",2,1,here is a thought i have been thinking about lately i used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation if you don't have friends no job don't have hobby's don't have money don't have a partner have a poor family situation it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression however recently i had a thought that that might not be quite the truth i think what could be the real problem leading to mental health disorders is that it's not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life it's that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck i mean that you don't find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation leading to worry and anxiety depression and so it's not per se your life situation quality or the fact that you are stuck but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble for example if someone with a mental health disorder takes a long vacation that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere as another example there are people with a decent life situation good financial situation kids good relationships but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life and starts to absorb all their thinking it's like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody,0.08715079365079363,-0.9156,NEGATIVE,0.9991962313652039,positive,negative,negative

Anxiety,hk99q9,"How I Overcame My Emotional and Physical (Health) Anxiety with Therapy, CBD Oil, and Time (and how you got this!)","Hello, wonderful people of r/anxiety! I’m posting this on my throwaway because I have photos of myself on my main and there’s some (potentially) private information here. Just trying to keep it safe. (-:

Before I tell my story, I just want to let everyone know that this is what worked for me and everybody will find different methods that work for them. I’m not touting a certain method over another and it’s all anecdotal. I’m not a doctor, just a college student, and I recommend seeking medical advice and exploring several resources that would help you find what works best for you. TL;DR at the bottom because this is long! Best wishes to everyone!

Onto my story.

I’m 20 (female) and entering my sophomore year of college in Canada (American but moved to Canada for college to escape my parents). I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I was scared of ridiculous things like my dad closing the car door too hard or random kids in school saying hi to me. My first panic attack ever was when a girl in my kindergarten art class dropped her art supplies. It was horrifying. I thought I was going to die. Since then, my anxiety has gotten only slightly better as I could rationalize some fears, but many others were still at the forefront of my panic attacks because your brain fucks with you like that.

When I entered my teen years is when I started realizing how much anxiety hindered my ability to be a person. I was shy, unable to make friends, constantly turning down invitations to hang out (my strict parents may have also played a part), terrified of trying new things, devoted seven days a week to school, and worst of all, scared of dying. I’d go silent in social situations and externalize my doubts into body language to the point where people didn’t want to interact with me when it happened. I only had textbooks to return to. As much as I’d love to tell you having a 3.98 in high school was great, retrospectively, it wasn’t. I felt like I wasted so many years of my life. I was more scared of dying than actually *living* before I die. A day where I didn’t have a single panic attack was a day well-lived for me. That was my standard even though I knew I wanted more. Schools don’t teach you a lot about mental health either. I didn’t know how to treat it. It was normal for me and I hated it. I became a recluse besides two or three friends and homework.

During my senior year, I got into a relationship with my ex-boyfriend. He introduced himself to me in class and I didn’t feel overly anxious around him (which was rare). I immediately felt at ease around him -- being nervous only in the ""new love"" sense. He was logical and kind. He was also incredibly supportive of me and genuinely cared about my mental health struggles. He told me about therapy and phone numbers I could call that would help me. He suggested medication as an option. He listened to my problems and despite not having immediate solutions, he guided me to where I could find help. But the sad part was my parents. They were, for lack of a better term, conservative (I love them more since they’ve become far more open, but they did hinder a lot of my growth). Therapy wasn’t an immediate option because of that and medication was also something I was very hesitant to try (ironically because of my fear of death).

Then the physical (health) anxiety came in halfway through my senior year. It started with random pains in my hands and feet. Then my heart would act up for no reason. The first time it happened, I went to the ER. They checked me for everything (heart conditions, thyroid issues, cancer, etc.) and found nothing. The doctor surmised that it was likely anxiety but I didn’t believe him. I was convinced that I was going to die any day now and that I had to have it diagnosed. My parents and I went to several specialists, each one returning to me with the health anxiety diagnosis. I couldn’t believe it. How the fuck could my mental pain cause me random, physical pains throughout my body? I wanted answers and my parents didn’t help. They told me to learn to deal with it and that it was all in my mind (anxiety and depression were things people just had to toughen out to them). Googling my symptoms sure didn’t help, either. “My heart has random pains? WebMD tells me it’s a heart attack. Guess I’m going to fucking die,” was my near-daily thought.

My boyfriend was the most supportive when my physical pain started. He suggested I look for a college further away from my parents where therapy and medical help is offered as part of tuition. He motivated me to keep looking for answers though he himself believed it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. I loved his support. I loved him. However, our relationship ended up failing. The pain and panic attacks caused by my anxiety interrupted our alone time and gradually affected our intimate life.  He was always a sweetheart with it but as it went on I could tell I was too much for him to handle. He would speak less when I had pains and his words felt more annoyed as time went on. I don’t blame him at all. Time and intimacy are important in a relationship. He sacrificed so much of it to make sure I was okay (including driving me to the ER because I had sharp pains in my legs before we were going to have sex).

But as I’ve learned, no one should have to burn themselves to keep others warm. He kept me warm but with progress months away, he broke up with me March of my senior year. He was genuinely apologetic and remorseful, but was hopeful and promised me that I would find something if I wanted to. It hurt a lot, and I knew he had every right to do so, but it also only made me feel worse about myself. My pain got worse. My panic attacks would occur every day now – multiple times – with some days being so bad I couldn’t even eat. Anxiety ruined a relationship that meant so much to me. I wanted to try medication but it made just the idea of it a death sentence for me. I despised my anxiety.

Regardless, I knew where I needed to start and what was needed. I applied to a Canadian university known for their biology program (I live in a state that borders Canada so it wasn’t too odd) and set my sights on getting better. After a long summer of pain and misery (and discovering all of you wonderful people here and at r/healthanxiety), college finally came. Immediately after my parents left, I looked for resources and registered for therapy sessions. I was skeptical at first (thanks to my parents) but knew that it was something worth trying. My therapist was a graduate student and we met once a week for thirty minutes. The first time, I had a horrible panic attack at the start but he calmed me down quickly. I then trusted his veracity and committed myself to our sessions and getting better. We discussed fears, reasons for concern, managing them, and so much more. Well, a month passed by and I noticed a significant improvement. I had far fewer panic attacks (about three or four a week) and could manage rising ones much better.

I do have to note that it didn’t happen immediately and it took time to see results, but they were good results nonetheless. It also wasn’t entirely therapy that helped but me *wanting* to get better too. I knew that to overcome my anxiety, I had to set goals I thought were impossible and convince myself that they were. I had to tell myself that, “this girl isn’t going to live like this any longer. This girl will be normal.” ""**Fake it 'til you make it,**"" if you will. It sounds cliché but it worked (barring the countless hours I spent telling myself it would come true). As time went on, I was more confident in who I was. I started talking to people and spoke up more. I made a few friends and stopped focusing so much on my grades. Spending time daily rationalizing social situations and interactions lent time to my growth. That shy personality that I despised **slowly** became outgoing and confident. Sadly, despite the improvement in my emotional anxiety, I still had physical anxiety that I couldn’t rationalize properly which caused my remaining panic attacks. My fear of dying was still there.

I brought medication up to my therapist and he said that he couldn’t “officially” suggest something but referred me to one of his supervisors who was a psychiatrist (specifically mentioning CBD oil among other anti-anxiety medication). I have to note that my therapist suffered from anxiety/health anxiety too and he himself took CBD oil with high praise for it. Initially, I thought it was bullshit like essential oils, but because I was in Canada, I thought I might as well see what the psychiatrist says. Well, he explained to me the significance of the brain’s relationship with the body and how the brain can ignite its own fight-or-flight response without a preemptive panic attack. He also added that my fear of death is because that flight response is constantly remaining active despite me knowing it doesn't make sense. He told me that because my progress in emotional anxiety didn’t aid my physical anxiety or my fear, medication was my best choice to prevent it from being triggered.

For each type of medication, he told me about the side effects. But for CBD oil, he prefaced the side effects noting that there wasn’t enough research to study the cons (thanks, Nixon, for the War on Drugs). When he listed the cons (diarrhea, possible weight changes, and fatigue), I found it significantly more preferable among things like Xanax, Paxil, Celexa, and Prozac. I knew CBD oil would be my best bet if I were to start taking medication. He also suggested the option that I learn to live with the pain and manage it, but I remembered my ex and realized that if I wanted to live a normal life with other people, anxiety pains and constant fears of death weren’t going to be an option. I can’t randomly get panic attacks every time the pain is worse than normal. I can’t keep thinking every little thing will kill me. I had to put aside my fear of medication and try it.

So I did (after a week of constant conversations with my brain).

Again, because Canada, he told me where I could easily find CBD oil and how to take it, so I went to purchase some (no prescription needed!). I avoided anything with THC content greater than 1% and then started taking it. I won’t go into detail about my process but will say that the first morning I ever took it, I felt very little pain the rest of the day. My worries about what would kill me felt insignificant. I never felt so relaxed. Things just made more sense? I don't know how to put it. After about one month, I had no more pain. I stopped having random pains and symptoms of medical conditions completely disappeared as long as I took CBD oil in the morning. I stopped reacting to hearing symptoms of health conditions and I started playing it less safe (safely, of course!!!). I felt like a new person.

Now, I feel better than I ever have. I’m not worried that I’m throwing my life away. 15-year-old me wouldn’t believe it. Her mouth would be agape. I’m going out with people, starting conversations, working out, NOT constantly worrying about every extra credit assignment in school, and most importantly, I knew that to enjoy life, there's always going to be risks. Some risks are worth more than others. That death was inevitable and not everything was a death sentence. That as long as I wasn’t endangering anyone, it was alright.

I would’ve never believed I would learn the intricacies of the gym. I would’ve panicked, stopped, and thought I was weak. Now, every gym day is another challenge. I never thought I could drink alcohol and not constantly panic thinking it would give me a heart attack (I drink responsibly!!! it's 19 there!!!), nevertheless actually go out to parties. I would’ve never thought about trying new fashion styles and embracing who I am. Now, I'm learning more about who I am and want to be and I try to best myself every day. Everything’s changed and I wish I could tell hopeless teen me that there is hope.

Yes, therapy helped. Yes, CBD oil helped. But what also helped was time. If I gave up believing that I could grow out of my shell, I would still be there. If I didn’t believe in therapy like my parents, I would still be an anxious mess. If I stopped looking for remedies for my physical pain, I’d probably be learning to live with it. If I didn’t keep pushing my mind, then everything would be the same. I gave the things I tried time and now I’m who I always dreamed to be and more.

I’m not saying what worked for me will work for you. I highly recommend therapy but have heard contradictory stories on CBD oil (though, mostly positive) so I can’t definitively say it will work for you. Everybody's different. There are resources you can seek and people you can talk to. Don’t give up hope. And if you were like old me and thought that medication is a handicap or only for ""seriously ill people"", my therapist once told me that sometimes they’re necessary like how glasses are for people who can’t see shit (also me). Everyone will take some medication one day. Some people need it more than others. So there are options for you to try. There is hope. One day you’ll have so many small and big progress stories that you won’t be able to post them here without getting reported as spam. And if your physical anxiety makes you think you’re going to die young even though you’ve been checked numerous times, there *are* remedies for it. It will eventually come down to how much you want it. Then the mental obstacles are the toughest, which is fine.

Thank you if you’ve read it this far. AMA, I’ll try to answer questions for as long as I remember this throwaway account. Sorry if it was long, but take this as my complete success story. You all got this! (-:

TL;DR – Anxious mess with physical pain from anxiety, ruined my life, and a relationship, and was always scared I was going to die until I went to therapy and started taking CBD oil. Now I’m better than I ever hoped I’d be after almost a year.

Edit1: I wanna add that I'm in a relationship again!!! Something I thought would be hard to come around to again but it happened! I'm also taking birth control which I also thought would never happen!

something i was very hesitant to try ironically because of my fear of death then the physical health anxiety came in halfway through my senior year it started with random pains in my hands and feet then my heart would act up for no reason the first time it happened i went to the er they checked me for everything heart conditions thyroid issues cancer etc and found nothing the doctor surmised that it was likely anxiety but i didn t believe him i was convinced that i was going to die any day now and that i had to have it diagnosed my parents and i went to several specialists each one returning to me with the health anxiety diagnosis i couldn t believe it how the fuck could my mental pain cause me random physical pains throughout my body i wanted answers and my parents didn t help they told me to learn to deal with it and that it was all in my mind anxiety and depression were things people just had to toughen out to them googling my symptoms sure didn t help either my heart has random pains webmd tells me it s a heart attack guess i m going to fucking die was my near daily thought my boyfriend was the most supportive when my physical pain started he suggested i look for a college further away from my parents where therapy and medical help is offered as part of tuition he motivated me to keep looking for answers though he himself believed it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety i loved his support i loved him however our relationship ended up failing the pain and panic attacks caused by my anxiety interrupted our alone time and gradually affected our intimate life he was always a sweetheart with it but as it went on i could tell i was too much for him to handle he would speak less when i had pains and his words felt more annoyed as time went on i don t blame him at all time and intimacy are important in a relationship he sacrificed so much of it to make sure i was okay including driving me to the er because i had sharp pains in my legs before we were going to have sex but as i ve learned no one should have to burn themselves to keep others warm he kept me warm but with progress months away he broke up with me march of my senior year he was genuinely apologetic and remorseful but was hopeful and promised me that i would find something if i wanted to it hurt a lot and i knew he had every right to do so but it also only made me feel worse about myself my pain got worse my panic attacks would occur every day now multiple times with some days being so bad i couldn t even eat anxiety ruined a relationship that meant so much to me i wanted to try medication but it made just the idea of it a death sentence for me i despised my anxiety regardless i knew where i needed to start and what was needed i applied to a canadian university known for their biology program i live in a state that borders canada so it wasn t too odd and set my sights on getting better after a long summer of pain and misery and discovering all of you wonderful people here and at r healthanxiety college finally came immediately after my parents left i looked for resources and registered for therapy sessions i was skeptical at first thanks to my parents but knew that it was something worth trying my therapist was a graduate student and we met once a week for thirty minutes the first time i had a horrible panic attack at the start but he calmed me down quickly i then trusted his veracity and committed myself to our sessions and getting better we discussed fears reasons for concern managing them and so much more well a month passed by and i noticed a significant improvement i had far fewer panic attacks about three or four a week and could manage rising ones much better i do have to note that it didn t happen immediately and it took time to see results but they were good results nonetheless it also wasn t entirely therapy that helped but me wanting to get better too i knew that to overcome my anxiety i had to set goals i thought were impossible and convince myself that they were i had to tell myself that this girl isn t going to live like this any longer this girl will be normal fake it 'til you make it if you will it sounds clich but it worked barring the countless hours i spent telling myself it would come true as time went on i was more confident in who i was i started talking to people and spoke up more i made a few friends and stopped focusing so much on my grades spending time daily rationalizing social situations and interactions lent time to my growth that shy personality that i despised slowly became outgoing and confident sadly despite the improvement in my emotional anxiety i still had physical anxiety that i couldn t rationalize properly which caused my remaining panic attacks my fear of dying was still there i brought medication up to my therapist and he said that he couldn t officially suggest something but referred me to one of his supervisors who was a psychiatrist specifically mentioning cbd oil among other anti anxiety medication i have to note that my therapist suffered from anxiety health anxiety too and he himself took cbd oil with high praise for it initially i thought it was bullshit like essential oils but because i was in canada i thought i might as well see what the psychiatrist says well he explained to me the significance of the brain s relationship with the body and how the brain can ignite its own fight or flight response without a preemptive panic attack he also added that my fear of death is because that flight response is constantly remaining active despite me knowing it doesn't make sense he told me that because my progress in emotional anxiety didn t aid my physical anxiety or my fear medication was my best choice to prevent it from being triggered for each type of medication he told me about the side effects but for cbd oil he prefaced the side effects noting that there wasn t enough research to study the cons thanks nixon for the war on drugs when he listed the cons diarrhea possible weight changes and fatigue i found it significantly more preferable among things like xanax paxil celexa and prozac i knew cbd oil would be my best bet if i were to start taking medication he also suggested the option that i learn to live with the pain and manage it but i remembered my ex and realized that if i wanted to live a normal life with other people anxiety pains and constant fears of death weren t going to be an option i can t randomly get panic attacks every time the pain is worse than normal i can t keep thinking every little thing will kill me i had to put aside my fear of medication and try it so i did after a week of constant conversations with my brain again because canada he told me where i could easily find cbd oil and how to take it so i went to purchase some no prescription needed i avoided anything with thc content greater than and then started taking it i won t go into detail about my process but will say that the first morning i ever took it i felt very little pain the rest of the day my worries about what would kill me felt insignificant i never felt so relaxed things just made more sense i don't know how to put it after about one month i had no more pain i stopped having random pains and symptoms of medical conditions completely disappeared as long as i took cbd oil in the morning i stopped reacting to hearing symptoms of health conditions and i started playing it less safe safely of course i felt like a new person now i feel better than i ever have i m not worried that i m throwing my life away year old me wouldn t believe it her mouth would be agape i m going out with people starting conversations working out not constantly worrying about every extra credit assignment in school and most importantly i knew that to enjoy life there's always going to be risks some risks are worth more than others that death was inevitable and not everything was a death sentence that as long as i wasn t endangering anyone it was alright i would ve never believed i would learn the intricacies of the gym i would ve panicked stopped and thought i was weak now every gym day is another challenge i never thought i could drink alcohol and not constantly panic thinking it would give me a heart attack i drink responsibly it's there nevertheless actually go out to parties i would ve never thought about trying new fashion styles and embracing who i am now i'm learning more about who i am and want to be and i try to best myself every day everything s changed and i wish i could tell hopeless teen me that there is hope yes therapy helped yes cbd oil helped but what also helped was time if i gave up believing that i could grow out of my shell i would still be there if i didn t believe in therapy like my parents i would still be an anxious mess if i stopped looking for remedies for my physical pain i d probably be learning to live with it if i didn t keep pushing my mind then everything would be the same i gave the things i tried time and now i m who i always dreamed to be and more i m not saying what worked for me will work for you i highly recommend therapy but have heard contradictory stories on cbd oil though mostly positive so i can t definitively say it will work for you everybody's different there are resources you can seek and people you can talk to don t give up hope and if you were like old me and thought that medication is a handicap or only for seriously ill people my therapist once told me that sometimes they re necessary like how glasses are for people who can t see shit also me everyone will take some medication one day some people need it more than others so there are options for you to try there is hope one day you ll have so many small and big progress stories that you won t be able to post them here without getting reported as spam and if your physical anxiety makes you think you re going to die young even though you ve been checked numerous times there are remedies for it it will eventually come down to how much you want it then the mental obstacles are the toughest which is fine thank you if you ve read it this far ama i ll try to answer questions for as long as i remember this throwaway account sorry if it was long but take this as my complete success story you all got this tl dr anxious mess with physical pain from anxiety ruined my life and a relationship and was always scared i was going to die until i went to therapy and started taking cbd oil now i m better than i ever hoped i d be after almost a year edit i wanna add that i'm in a relationship again something i thought would be hard to come around to again but it happened i'm also taking birth control which i also thought would never happen edit just wanted to update that i've

Anxiety,1bhl2h,Does anyone else have problems with their friends/family believing what you say? And not just about your mental health problems? (xposted to r/depression),"I no longer have any friends and am close to only 1 sister, so I have no one to really talk to about this stuff (I guess other than my shrink). Believe me when I say that I appreciate anyone just reading this.

I don't know if it's my anxiety or not but this feeling that my family don't entirely believe me when I tell them things I swear borders on the paranoid (which I guess makes me more anxious, yay).

Eg. I've talked to them many times about my sleeping problems. I have been having disturbed sleep for almost 18months thanks to my AD Cymbalta and it's affected me so much more than I can explain. I'm currently on my 4th kind of sleeping tablets, which kind of work but not really. But they always seem to act like I'm exaggerating or just attention seeking or something. It is so depressing.

Or trying to explain why I still refuse to speak to my father. He's severely bipolar, has a quick temper, is verbally abusive to the point of making you feel like he will become physically abusive, is an insecure narcissist, is extremely racist, prejudice, hates people and is a conspiracy theory pscyho. He didn't like that I wasn't on his 'side' after another long psycho rant about 'blacks', etc, and told me he didn't want anything to do with me and hasn't spoken to me in 2 years. No matter how many times I try to explain this to the rest of the family it's like they're not actually listening to me.

I guess what depresses/annoys me the most is that I have real trouble even trusting myself and when I feel justified in thinking that other people don't believe or trust me I feel completely worthless, like a non-being.",46,30,i no longer have any friends and am close to only sister so i have no one to really talk to about this stuff i guess other than my shrink believe me when i say that i appreciate anyone just reading this i don't know if it's my anxiety or not but this feeling that my family don't entirely believe me when i tell them things i swear borders on the paranoid which i guess makes me more anxious yay eg i've talked to them many times about my sleeping problems i have been having disturbed sleep for almost months thanks to my ad cymbalta and it's affected me so much more than i can explain i'm currently on my th kind of sleeping tablets which kind of work but not really but they always seem to act like i'm exaggerating or just attention seeking or something it is so depressing or trying to explain why i still refuse to speak to my father he's severely bipolar has a quick temper is verbally abusive to the point of making you feel like he will become physically abusive is an insecure narcissist is extremely racist prejudice hates people and is a conspiracy theory pscyho he didn't like that i wasn't on his 'side' after another long psycho rant about 'blacks' etc and told me he didn't want anything to do with me and hasn't spoken to me in years no matter how many times i try to explain this to the rest of the family it's like they're not actually listening to me i guess what depresses annoys me the most is that i have real trouble even trusting myself and when i feel justified in thinking that other people don't believe or trust me i feel completely worthless like a non being,0.07433333333333335,-0.9962,NEGATIVE,0.9985583424568176,positive,negative,negative
Anxiety,wgzg12,After taking a week of work for my mental health now I feel like I never want to go back...,"So I struggle with depression and mild anxiety but I had a very stressful and triggering situation at work over a week ago that just made my anxiety 10x worse and led to panic attacks.

After talking to a doctor we decided that taking a week off would be beneficial for me. Work were supportive and I've been off since Tuesday... since then I caught up on sleep, read books (haven't done that in ages), scrolled through reddit and spend time just by myself. I also avoided picking up to phone or replying to texts from family and friends,  only left the house when absolutely necessary, skipped a shower or two.

Now it's Friday and I'm freaking out - on Monday I'm expected back at work. I do like my job but currently just can't stand the idea of having to do anything. Talking to anyone, putting on a fake smile and saying that 'yes I'm better now, thanks!' Or 'I'm good/fine/OK' when it's not true. 

On one hand I'm thinking I'm genuinely not 'good' enough to go back to work on the other, I'm thinking did this week off just made me worse because before I was able to cope and get through the day and have normal human interactions and now when I spent time not doing any of that I ended up isolating myself more?

I guess I'm rambling but Tl:dr did I make myself worse by taking time off rather than trying to force myself to carry on as 'normal'?

Anxiety,ymq833,A realisation for mental health issues,"After having struggled with anxiety and depression (social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder) for many years, I wanted to share one realization that has worked more than anything for helping me get rid of my mental health issues. Now, before I go into this further, I do want to point out that whenever you have a suspicion of having a mental health disorder, it is imperative that you make sure you know which mental health disorder(s) you have: this is a necessary first step. I really believe without doing this, people are just walking in the mist and have no understanding of what is going on with them. Therefore, either getting yourself diagnosed or doing a self-diagnosis first is crucial. 

Once you are reasonably sure of exactly which mental health disorder(s) you have, the next thing to realise is that each one of the mental health disorders is actually a specific psychological adaptation, meaning a set of cognitive and behavioural strategies part of our genetics (so developed throughout our evolution) that become activated in certain circumstances. This in and of itself is should be a major realisation: the personality changes that you see in yourself are what would happen to anyone for who this mental health issue becomes activated (and everyone has them in their DNA). For example, if you have generalised anxiety disorder (meaning excessive and uncontrollable worry all the time), one of the personality changes there is that you become chronically irritable: even small stuff can really trigger you or annoy you. Therefore the next necessary step is finding out what the characteristic changes in thinking and behaviour are that come with the mental health disorder and really doing this thoroughly. For example for social anxiety disorder, the most defining characteristic there is fear of negative evaluation from other people. I recommend writing down all the symptoms/characteristics changes associated with a certain mental health disorder somewhere in a notes app on your phone so you have them with you at all times. 

Finally, to make this work in practice you need to develop a 24/7 awareness of what you think, how you feel and what you do. This last step is the most challenging but also extremely key. Without this, you can't see the water around you where you are swimming in, and the water is the said personality changes/ symptoms of a certain mental health disorder. People adjust to their way of thinking, feeling and behaviour and it quickly becomes a new normal for them, they think they are their thoughts, feelings and behaviour, while they are just characteristic changes that are part of a mental health disorder. For many people worrying is just normal, and it becomes their way of living; same with their negative thinking, they think everything they believe is the truth (all the negative beliefs they hold), and do not realise their specific thoughts, actions and feelings (the water) are normal symptoms or byproducts of specific mental health disorders. 

Developing this 24/7- level awareness of what you think, feel and do, and always associating them back with a symptom/personality change with a mental health disorder may sound like a daunting thing, but I think it can go rather easily and smoothly once you make the switch. Also, I really sometimes think to myself how this 24/7 level of awareness is actually completely necessary; If you don't, you will always be vulnerable to unexpected worry of negative thinking taking off without being aware of it. So I really recommend developing an all-time awareness and coupling back to symptoms. 

A note here, this approach of all-time awareness and coupling back immediately is quite different from CBT (and all the variants), the most common and effective therapy for many mental health disorders. For me personally, but other people might work differently, is that fighting with thoughts is on some level always pouring oil on fire... . What works much more effectively is merely the awareness that you are worrying again, and that this is part of the mental health issue you have. So really important is that is about just having awareness, and contrary to what a lot of therapies suggest such as CBT variants;  you don't go into the content of the thought trying to see if it is true or not, or find ways to calm your mind down with a comforting thought. Again that might work for others, but there is a lot of power in just identifying the water that is all around you and seeing that it comes naturally with a mental health disorder and knowing that it is perfectly normal to have these personality changes. 

An important side note is that developing this awareness is a skill in and of itself. Many people with depression have developed such an ability for negative thinking they automatically start thinking negatively about everything, and people with worry worry about everything: they fear about the fear not going away, they have anxiety about their negative thinking, or negative thinking about anxiety, worry about worrying too much, or worrying that nothing will works, .. and what might be even the most tricky thing off all, they have negative thinking, worry and anxiety that is reactive: even if they become aware of a certain worry and they see that it is part of generalised anxiety disorder, they would start to worry about that too in some way (e.g. ok but how does merely identifying it solve the problem,.. ) and so there is this constant reacting with worry and negative thinking-effect that is extremely tricky to catch, but again,.. with all time awareness and taking a step back, looking at your thoughts, behaviour and action, you can also see that that' reactive worry and negative thinking' is also just a form of negative thinking or worry, and part of the characteristics of a mental health disorder. 

That being said, even though I think this capability of 24/7 awareness and coupling back can be very useful, it is by no means in and of itself sufficient for curing you of your mental health disorders, but I wrote it down here because I think for many it could be a helpful treatment component part of other treatment components. And I do recommend that if you have figured out which mental health disorder you have, you look into the other standard treatment components: e.g. for generalised anxiety, we have diet, exercising, mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing and so on.

I apologize in advance if this is a long post, so here goes.

Background info: I'm a 30 year old male who was diagnosed with Anxiety/depression and GERD w/ a hiatal hernea at 16. (Had the scope done) It was a terrible cycle of having anxiety from going to school and being afraid I'd puke from my GERD, which in turn made the GERD worse. Well after being on Nexium and Citalopram for a bit over a year, I seemed to be okay.

Fast forward to 22/23 years old. I wake up one day for work with extreme vertigo. Never experiencing this before, I freaked out. Queue the visits to the ER, my GP, ENT, etc. The closest conclusion they got was BPPV. But the only issue was it lasted for 4 months. From Nov to the end of Feb/early Mar. I had just gotten over a cold prior to it starting, which was maybe a factor too, but it still seemed like an incredibly long time to have it. I really felt it when I'd turn my head or try and walk to fast. Well the duration freaked me out. And with Google at my fingertips, I went down the rabbit hole. Convinced myself it was MS, despite no family history or anything. GP says probably not, but would humor me and refer me to a Neuro. Only problem was the Neuro was booked out 3 months. This was a heavy blow, and I ended up just giving up and trying to adapt as best I could. Well, one day I woke up and it was magically gone. Obviously I was elated, but in the back of my mind I still never got a formal diagnosis or have any idea what caused/fixed it. Will it come back? Will it come back worse? Well, after some time passed, things seemed good and life went on. I'd get a few little flare ups here and there, but nothing as debilitating.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. My girlfriend and I were chatting and she randomly brings up how I ""sleep weird"". I asked what she meant and she said it sounds like you stop breathing in your sleep. Great. I have a family history of apnea so figured I'd schedule an appointment with my doctor and go from there. Well, a few days after this I got a pretty heavy feeling in the upper left part of my chest, and I felt like I couldn't get a satisfying breath. Naturally I think I'm having a heart attack. I decided to go to the ER since my dad claims he had one at 31. The doctors do a work up with blood and a chest CT, say everything looks good and it's probably GERD. Mind you my GERD rarely bothers me anymore as long as I'm  not chowing down ghost peppers or Tabasco. But they gave me a prescription for generic Nexium and sent me on my way. This was 9 days ago. Since then, my symptoms have absolutely exploded. Probably easier to list them out:
-Cool sensation on my legs, which turned to heavy/weak feeling

-Extremely Sweaty feet (gross, I know)
-Mild dizziness. Manageable but annoying
-Pins and needs sensation on my left cheek/left side throat
-Brain fog
-Brain Zap? Not sure how to describe it, just an odd feeling 
-Scalp tingling on left side
-One headache last night that felt as though it was radiating from the top of my head. Sensitive to noise and light from it
- Some form of Disassociation? Happened during headache and seemed as though it wasn't really me it was happening too? Sorry if that's the wrong word for it, but it freaked me out.

These all come and go, the only constants are my legs, sweaty feet, mild dizziness, and brain fog/feeling weird. The weird thing is, I don't notice the breaths anymore, nor do I have the same chest sensations either. 

The duration of all of these is what concerns me. Its been roughly a week or so today. I had a follow up with my GP last Wednesday after my ER visit and he joined the GERD train. Well I ended up calling him yesterday and explaining my new symptoms and he had essentially said it's probably a nerve in my back since I work at a desk, and to be more active and go for walks.

Another side note is I did have one panic attack about 4 years ago during a long and stressful move. Tunnel vision, palpitations, feel like you can't breath, etc. This same doctor gave me a prescription for Alprazolam (0.5mg) to take as needed. 

Well over the past few days I've tried to do as much research as I could regarding anxiety and it's effects, stress etc. I've poured over this Subreddit as well as the Health anxiety one, just to see how others have dealt with this. I've never really felt anxious this entire time, up until the last week when more symptoms began to show. I had a breakdown today from a combination of frustration, upsetting Google finds, etc. I have an appt with my Psychiatrist on the 25th for ADHD follow up from a few months ago, but that seems like an eternity from now. I've convinced myself there's something wrong with my brain (tumor, nerve related, etc) which is a hard pill to swallow. I feel like I need an MRI to confirm its nothing, but Im not sure how to do that without another ER visit. I'm at a loss. It's hard to function this way. I have a 1 year old son that is my world, but whenever I think about the uncertainty of this situation and how it affects him, I lose it. 

So that's where I'm at, feeling as though I've had an actual mental breakdown. Perhaps the initial comment my GF made triggered some form of subconscious anxiety and started this? I'm not sure what the next logical step is, as the ""wait and see"" approach that I normally take isn't helping this time at all. I'm grateful for anyone else's stories that have gone through something similar, or what suggestions or advice anyone may have (if allowed). Thank you",3,4,hello everyone i've never really posted before but am essentially at my wits end with what's been going on i guess i'm looking for similar stories or advice for those of you that can

Anxiety,pq9sjq,I am a memtal health support worker and I fare worse than the people i work with. How to fix it?,"It's just that i had a challenging life until i manage to run away and move to UK. My abilities are mostly in IT but can't really find work in a pandemic so mental health was the way.

I advanced a great deal since i was a teen, back then i couldn't speak to a stranger and i would've been paranoid all the time. 

But now after all that time i still rely on food, impulsive purchasing,  video games, Netflix and board games to be happy and not depressed. But this undermines my own ability to learn and get better and possibly a job in IT.

I feel anxious most of the time especially when walking down the street to work by myself i have an eerie sensation of unknown and i feel like i am in a strange place that i do not know. When in reality i walked that street for a year now and i am very familiar with. 

I feel sometimes like i am unsure about anything  and its funny because people that i support are better at this than me. They cope much better with anxiety. 

During the night i have panic attacks thinking about how time passes by and i slowly but surely get to my inevitable death.

Kind of pointless to think about it because its inevitable but still i don't want to die like ever.

The best thing i did was to leave my abusive parents that fucked up 20 years of my life . But what to do further to move even more towards a good thing because i started to struggle more day by day with this and there is no one to talk to.

Anxiety,uuwgsr,Anyone else witnessed the anxiety / mental health epidemic with their own two eyes?,"I feel like I have seen an inordinate number of people in my generation taken down my severe, functionally debilitating and chronic depression-anxiety conditions. I was one of those people but luckily I got better. I can still think of multiple childhood friends that I would say more or less have their lives destroyed or at least a very bad quality of life due to these incurable conditions.

There has been some discussion lately that we shouldn’t put all the blame on social media, a New York Times article for example. In my opinion that is exactly the problem, the digitalization of social life - smartphones, computers are half the problem, the other half is the far more concentrated negativity of social networking apps.

I personally think we aren’t going to solve the problem satisfactorily unless we get really advanced neuroscience backed targeted treatments for these conditions because it seems like there’s many specific subtypes. There does not seem to be one cure for all cases.

I also think we will need to build a scientific framework that is able to identify, pinpoint and measure what specifically is the problem about all the environmental factors that are screwing up peoples brains so much and enforce restrictions on those negative influences. For example, in the 1970’s they discovers DDT was bad for bird eggs or something; so they banned it. We need the same thing to happen for mental health. We need to be able to point at something very specific and say, if you grow up with this, it can very likely cause getting your brain function tipped into this bad equilibrium that you can’t get it out of; here’s why.

Some people say that it’s not screens that are the problem, it’s what we do on the screens. I disagree very much. I think screens and computers have a very different sensory, cognitive and conscious effect than other media or environmental ambiences like nature or paper books. I believe that in many ways computers themselves are a significant problem.

I just felt like sharing this. I have walked through the underworld and I know that depression and anxiety are nothing less than life sentences. They strip fully healthy people of their potential. They make people so miserable, so tortured inside that they don’t go out of the house anywhere, break off contact with their childhood friends, feel intense feelings of guilt, shame and self loathing at every hour of the day, cannot sleep because of insomnia, can’t have relationships because of impotence, can’t make friends because of excruciating social anxiety and cognitive changes associated with depression, can’t pursue their talents or dreams because of cognitive impairments related to depression, have difficulty getting things done due to heavy levels of lethargy that set in. These are really serious medical disorders and people’s lives have lost all virtue. They are clinging on by a thread. There is a huge problem in our society right now and personally I wont be satisfied until I see the problem solved on a societal level.",1,2,i feel like i have seen an inordinate number of people in my generation taken down my severe functionally debilitating and chronic depression anxiety conditions i was one of those people but luckily i got better i can still think of multiple childhood friends that i would say more or less have their lives destroyed or at least a very bad quality of life due to these incurable conditions there has been some discussion lately that we shouldn t put all the blame on social media a new york times article for example in my opinion that is exactly the problem the digitalization of social life smartphones computers are half the problem the other half is the far more concentrated negativity of social networking apps i personally think we aren t going to solve the problem satisfactorily unless we get really advanced neuroscience backed targeted treatments for these conditions because it seems like there s many specific subtypes there does not seem to be one cure for all cases i also think we will need to build a scientific framework that is able to identify pinpoint and measure what specifically is the problem about all the environmental factors that are screwing up peoples brains so much and enforce restrictions on those negative influences for example in the s they discovers ddt was bad for bird eggs or something so they banned it we need the same thing to happen for mental health we need to be able to point at something very specific and say if you grow up with this it can very likely cause getting your brain function tipped into this bad equilibrium that you can t get it out of here s why some people say that it s not screens that are the problem it s what we do on the screens i disagree very much i think screens and computers have a very different sensory cognitive and conscious effect than other media or environmental ambiences like nature or paper books i believe that in many ways computers themselves are a significant problem i just felt like sharing this i have walked through the underworld and i know that depression and anxiety are nothing less than life sentences they strip fully healthy people of their potential they make people so miserable so tortured inside that they don t go out of the house anywhere break off contact with their childhood friends feel intense feelings of guilt shame and self loathing at every hour of the day cannot sleep because of insomnia can t have relationships because of impotence can t make friends because of excruciating social anxiety and cognitive changes associated with depression can t pursue their talents or dreams because of cognitive impairments related to depression have difficulty getting things done due to heavy levels of lethargy that set in these are really serious medical disorders and people s lives have lost all virtue they are clinging on by a thread there is a huge problem in our society right now and personally i wont be satisfied until i see the problem solved on a societal level,0.01800337559266132,-0.9975,NEGATIVE,0.9992203712463379,neutral,negative,negative

Anxiety,vbqrfj,I think my parents messed up marriage completely ruined my mental health for good.,"Diagnosed: GAD, OCD

(Signs of panic disorder but not diagnosed)

My parents got divorced when I was 9, before then, for about 4 years they constantly argued, yelled, slammed doors and cursed at each other all the time. I would sit there and watch all of this happen but I didn’t understand why. I have 2 other siblings, one of which is 4 years older than me would try to intervene and that would often get the yelling directed towards us. I remember the night a police officer showed up to the door forcing my parents to split up for the night and we had to choose who to go with, me being the youngest I just chose whoever my siblings chose, and that was my mom. After they got divorced and remarried we stayed at each parents house 50/50 which was good but it was hell. My dad would often talk about how I betrayed him because I chose to go with my mom instead of him, this would make me feel really guilty and I (as a teen) would go to my room and have outbursts, bursting into tears, hyperventilating, hitting myself, pulling my hair, and at one point I stabbed myself in the chest with a toothbrush and it broke in half. I never wanted to hurt myself, I just done it out of anger towards myself, I hated myself because I felt guilty that I ruined their relationship and betrayed my father. I’m not saying my father (or mother) was a bad parent, he done everything a parent should but from the emotional damage that their divorce plus his stressful job had on him he would often have anger that he let out on me. I’m not going to make this much longer, I just wanted to say that now as an adult I have anxiety almost daily, Panic attacks, derealization and depersonalization. Mild depression, and OCD that makes life hard. I want to say I’ll never forgive them as long as I have these problems but I don’t want to blame them because they were going through some hard stuff. I am in counseling, my therapist seemed to have trouble finding out where my anxiety came from because I really didn’t know. One day she asked me if my parents fought a lot before their divorce and I just broke out into tears. She knew right away. With counseling and medication my anxiety has gotten better but I don’t think I’ll ever fully recover. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to live a normal life and that makes me feel useless.

Anxiety,vxb2ku,Help! Should I inform my new employer about my mental health diagnoses/issues and give them a note from my therapist of my various diagnoses and other details and then also maybe a note from my doctor who’s been prescribing me my meds?,"I just started a new job last week and have already missed three days due to my severe anxiety disorders/panic disorder/depression. The first time I said I had a family emergency and the other two times I missed I just said I was feeling really sick/unwell. I just feel so much fucking shame right now because I thought I was doing much better and finally able to kind of function again in society. I’ve been on an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety med (prozac) as well as a mood stabilizer (trileptal) for awhile now and I think they’ve been helping a lot and in addition to that I’ve been seeing a therapist as well. So I’m doing all the right things but I already feel like I’m slowly, gradually sabotaging myself because of all my damn issues and I only just started this new job last week. And not to mention, it’s just a part time gig for now but will start full time next month. I am just so fucking infuriated with myself, this has been a pattern in my life, not being able to hold down a job due to all of my mental health shit and no one in my life has ever been able to even try to empathize. So I just feel increasingly shitty. It’s this crippling and debilitating inertia I feel like. I only get screamed at by my family, primarily my mom about all of this though and have been all my life. I’ve had all of these severe mental health problems since I was 9 and I’m 31 now and words cannot even describe how profoundly hellish and nightmarish it has been, not to sound melodramatic (my family namely my mom always just tells me I’m melodramatic etc).

&#x200B;

I just feel so fucking helpless, useless, worthless, shameful, angry at myself, and so many other emotions. I also feel so fucking lazy/slothful, unproductive, like a failure, etc. It’s just fucking debilitating and crippling. And of course I feel super paranoid now primarily about getting fired for missing work etc. I’ve never revealed all of my mental health diagnoses/issues to any employer in the past because I’ve always feared discrimination/being judged harshly/bosses and colleagues not understanding and consequently treating me like shit because of my mental health stuff etc. I’m also in grad school currently getting my Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and that’s actually going really well shockingly but I hadn’t worked in a long time frankly so this new job that I just started last week is the first one I’ve had in ages. I cannot afford to fuck this up because I really need this job/need money of course and whatnot. And plus if I fuck this up I will have to face my mom’s completely and utterly terrifying wrath when she’s back from her trip (she will absolutely destroy me/never stop screaming bloody murder at me and she will likely do something very drastic too) and I’m currently living with her and will most likely be stuck here until I finally graduate with my Master’s. This doesn’t even make any sense, my new coworkers/bosses are so incredibly nice and the days I’ve been there thus far I was doing really well I thought and was really enjoying it. It really seems like a great place to work thus far. I just don’t get what is wrong with me. I just get so fucking petrified. It's just damn near impossible oftentimes to even get out of bed and do things and be productive. Anxiety way too often doesn’t make any fucking sense to me.

&#x200B;

I just don’t know what the fuck to do. Should I be transparent and tell my boss everything that’s going on with me in regards to my mental health stuff/fill her in or not tell them what’s really going on? Ugh I feel like absolute shit about myself right now. I am so livid with myself. I keep agonizing about this ceaselessly and just desperately need advice from people who actually can understand this! Plus I don’t really have a support system in my life whatsoever currently. Also my diagnoses have been severe generalized anxiety disorder, severe depression, severe panic disorder/panic attacks, agoraphobia, social anxiety, and most likely C-PTSD (I had a psychiatrist tell me once that I most likely had C-PTSD also but it wasn’t a formal diagnosis I don’t think.)

Anxiety,vs3tn7,Should I seek help for my mental health if I feel this way? Also how do I start that convo with my gp?,"* Not being able to relax, overwhelmed anxious all the time. People have said that I appear calm and happy, a bit too calm, but I almost always feel overwhelmed. Not just hard things like doing research or something, even something as simple as going to the supermarket to get snacks overwhelms me and I often don't go.
* Not motivated at all to do things i used to love doing, including studying- too overwhelmed to finish anything, which is also very tiring so when i am not anxious i am too tired to do anything.
* Difficulty getting out of bed despite getting a good amount of sleep- too overwhelmed, even the thought of getting up and making coffee is too much to handle. For context I got a 97 ATAR so have done things that are much more complex, even got state merits at the end of yr 12. On a good day in the past 7-8 months, I get up at 12, on a bad day I get out of bed at 4 in the evening- crying all day, reminiscing on all the bad things that have ever happened.
* One of the reasons I took a gap yr was because of this
* Depression and anxiety runs in family. Grandmum has been medicated for anxiety for ever since I can remember. Mum had depression when I was 5ish, witnessed one of her suicide attempts myself.
* There's this emotional void in me which feels like it could never be filled. Due to this emotional void, I try to fill other people's emotional voids. I try to make other people feel loved unconditionally, even if they would never do the same for me. My mother, brother and sister would never sacrifice anything for me. I feel so lonely, like no one's on my side in this world. I feel like people use me to support them and then don't care about me at all when I am in the depths of despair. My mother doesn't even talk to me on days she does not need any help. Many times when I have been in my worst state, I have considered killing myself. I have considered slitting my wrists, stopping to breathe until my brain dies or even ingesting the bottle of orange essential oil in my room. But seems like death wouldn't save me any agony either since suicide is a sin in my religion.

Should I seek help for my mental health if I feel this way? Also how do I start this convo with my gp? I am just afraid of being judged that I am sharing these details for attention seeking/ making a big deal out of nothing.

Anxiety,vn5e9o,"Paranoid about my partners mental health all the time, how to cope better?","I think I have some trauma of finding my partners personal journals 6 few years ago where theyve written down how they fantasized about killing themselves. they've constantly reassured me since then that they don't want to or intend to, but its left me extremely paranoid all the time about their mental well-being even years later. They've written grotesque and violent thoughts in personal journals while just sitting next to me while seemingly fine and that makes me even MORE paranoid even if they seem just fine and happy and it makes me question my reality a TON. 

Whenever they seem quieter than usual or aren't usually themselves I get paranoid. I get anxious and paranoid that they're suicidal or horribly depressed when like this. I get massive paranoid thoughts about everything they do, if I see them looking on maps for my a place to go on a walk in nature my mind spirals and instantly goes into thoughts that makes me think ""they're looking for places to kill themselves"" earlier when they left to go get something from their car i watched them go to their car because I was afraid they were going to drive away and not come back. It's extremely irrational I know. It's exhausting. I don't want to feel like this. 

I feel so awful all the time and worry about them 24/7. 

I don't want them to constantly reassure me that they're okay and I don't want them to be any more exhausted or mentally drained.

Anxiety,sowgbn,Mental health,"Hello. I don’t typically reach out to people on the internet but I just have to get out what I’m feeling to see if anyone has any advice or something. Recently with my life I’ve been feeling very depressed. That sounds vague. but to go in depth with it, on a daily basis I deal with negative repetitive thoughts, and a lot of depersonalization and disassociation. It makes my day to day life hard and my outlook and perception of life is pretty messed up. I don’t feel like the same person I used to growing up as a kid, I had a pretty good child hood I’d say for the most part. Now as a senior in high school ready to graduate, I’d say this is the hardest thing I’ve had to deal with yet. And I hope this situation isn’t some type of terminal condition. But anyways. Sometimes I don’t really know who I am or what my exact purpose is for my life. Or why even any of us are here exactly. No one does. And that’s fine but it’s just hard to find something meaningful. And yes I know what my name is, and all of that shit. But I’m not sure what really makes me who I am compared to other people, or if the identity of the self is just some type of illusion. But growing up and realizing all of this existential nonsense is kinda terrifying ngl lmao. As a kid I was ditsy and didn’t really think about any of that stuff. I also have a fear of losing control or becoming schizophrenic and completely just ruining my one chance of living.

Anxiety,wgyvzf,My mental health challenge,"Hi everyone, I have recently created a fundraiser page for the Charity of Mind who specialise in bringing awareness to mental health and whose work I would like not only for myself to contribute to but also for you too lend a hand as well. For the last six years I have suffered mental health problems, specifically anxiety and depression, which have affected the quality of my life and have created obstacles for me and everyone else suffering from these issues, that can feel unbearable to deal with. The mental health sector in the United Kingdom is an area of health that goes unrecognised by many people and unfortunately is also undertreated. It is for these reasons that I have decided to use some of my own time to try and help Mind to bring more awareness to people about Mental health and the problems associated with it. 

I would like for as many of you to take part in a challenge that I have created called ""Swimming for Mind"", which would mean that for those participating they should try and go swimming for an hour,  four days a week for raising awareness for mental health and the work that Mind do. Physical activity like swimming has proven to provide great benefits for ones mental health and should be a priority in everyone's schedule; I usually do my swimming at my local leisure centre which is in Biddulph. On my fundraising page you can also donate some money that all goes to the Mind charity, you could donate money and do the challenge or if you wanted to just donate money that would be fine. I hope this post reaches out to many of you and I hope that it at least provides just a little bit more awareness to mental health.",2,0,hi everyone i have recently created a fundraiser page for the charity of mind who specialise in bringing awareness to mental health and whose work i would like not only for myself to contribute to but also for you too lend a hand as well for the last six years i have suffered mental health problems specifically anxiety and depression which have affected the quality of my life and have created obstacles for me and everyone else suffering from these issues that can feel unbearable to deal with the mental health sector in the united kingdom is an area of health that goes unrecognised by many people and unfortunately is also undertreated it is for these reasons that i have decided to use some of my own time to try and help mind to bring more awareness to people about mental health and the problems associated with it i would like for as many of you to take part in a challenge that i have created called swimming for mind which would mean that for those participating they should try and go swimming for an hour four days a week for raising awareness for mental health and the work that mind do physical activity like swimming has proven to provide great benefits for ones mental health and should be a priority in everyone's schedule i usually do my swimming at my local leisure centre which is in biddulph on my fundraising page you can also donate some money that all goes to the mind charity you could donate money and do the challenge or if you wanted to just donate money that would be fine i hope this post reaches out to many of you and i hope that it at least provides just a little bit more awareness to mental health,0.07756410256410258,0.9707,NEGATIVE,0.9442799091339111,positive,positive,negative
Anxiety,pmderl,I have nothing to do at home so I thought I could share a lil about my mental health and me...,"Hi, I would like to maintain myself anonymous because I feel more comfortable like that... So let's say I'm ""M"". Btw, English is not my first language, so sorry if it have some mistakes :) 

I felt like sharing a little about my mental health in this reddit because I don't actually know :) 

Let's go to the story...
Because of the pandemic, the amount of times I left my house were literally 1 in every 2 months (to go to the supermarket, or my dentist appointments), so it kinda had a impact in my social life and mental health.
(Detail: even before the pandemic, I didn't got out of the house, so yeah..)
Four months ago I notice that I wasn't feeling motived to do things that I liked to do before, my self-esteem just went down in a significant way and everyday seemed like I was watching my life from far away. And it just got worse, I always thought about telling about how I was feeling to my family but I don't feel like they would actually care.
 A month ago I said to my mom that I wasn't feeling that motivated to do anything, I was feeling useless and didn't cared about anything in my life, for my surprise she said that I was just bored of being  at home and that I wasn't useless, done.
I got really sad, maybe it was my fault because I don't open myself to my family or tell them how I feel, but she could have asked me more, you know?
After that things just got even worse, during 3 days I was feeling a strange chest pain, like a pressure. I got scared, because I was hoping it would just go away eventually but it didn't, I did a research and saw it could be due to anxiety or a serious heart problem, like a angina.
In the 4th day I said to my dad and he took me to the hospital (when he took me to the hospital it was 25 August at 8:30pm). I talked with the doctor alone and said how I was feeling, I said that because of the pandemic I was more nervous when I get out of home (since I stayed a long time inside), she said that it could be something more emotional but anyways I would do 2 exams to be sure if it wasn't nothing to do with my heart.
After 2 hours of exam I went to talk with her again (this time with my dad) and she said everything was okay and like she thought, it was something emotional. She said that would put me in the line with a psychologist but didn't know if I would be called due to Covid-19, but If I did I would receive a letter.
Happily the chest pain stopped, it isn't that regular anymore, but I still feel it sometimes, I started to feel some more symptoms maybe of anxiety or even depression, I don't actually know... Or maybe I'm just going through a fisical and emotional burn out? Well, I hope it gets better when my classes starts, maybe then I'll get distracted with something else.

Anxiety,cyvt07,Years of neglecting my mental health backfired last night.,"I've been having issues with anxiety and depression since I was a small kid. I never really got help or seeked it, and as I got older I figured I have it under control since I can do my job and most things that need doing. Theres been rough patches, some really nightmareish ones and times when life has been surprisingly good and manageable. 

Despite what I'm about to tell you, this past year has been one of the better ones. I moved to a city I've always wanted to live in, landed a paid internship at my dream job and met my amazing girlfriend who I love with all my heart.

When I started the internship I was so nervous I couldn't get good sleep, that I puked every morning before leaving the house, and spent the commute freaking the fuck out but managed to calm down to a working condition by the time I arrived. This happened every morning without exception for a few months, then it started getting easier. Easier as in I didn't puke every morning anymore but I had a panic attack most mornings. 

For a while now I hadn't felt so great. I lost most of my hardcore motivation to get through the day and I've been having worse panic attacks than ever before throughout the day. I've felt that I'm heading towards a burnout for quite some time, but I thought I could get away with it somehow.

Yesterday evening I started feeling really weird, I felt really weak and heavy. My heart felt like lt was about to come out of my chest and I got that familiar sensation of impending doom except its never been this bad before. I called the emergency number, crying my eyes out. During the call I felt like I was coming down from it a bit and the lady told me to call again if it gets worse and she'll send an ambulance. For a moment I felt like the worst had passed, but then it got 10 times worse. I called my Mom, I called my girlfriend, they both came over. They managed to calm me down, I felt like it was over. Then it got worse again, and it kept getting worse with no end in sight. 

I've never felt that much terror in my life. We hopped in the car and started driving to the hospital running multiple red lights. I was screaming and crying that I can't breathe, and the panic just kept rising. When we got to the ER I was a trembling mess, just whimpering and begging ""please help me, please make it stop"". It took forever for someone to come see me, my girlfriend asked for help multiple times. After it went on for a while I started to come down on my own for real this time and they took me in to see how I was doing. I left the ER with a few pills in my pocket and weeks worth of sick leave. 

I feel a bit better now, I have an appointment tomorrow at the doctors to get me into therapy and medication.

Anxiety,qc52lt,Fear and Shame about my Mental Health and Substance Use but seeking help anyway.,"I've struggled with Depression and Anxiety my whole life but as I got older it got worse. I felt too ashamed and worried about what the Dr may think of me if I went to them with my problems. At the age of 25 I resorted to Drugs. Cannabis has been my main crutch but in recent years I started dabbling in other drugs like prescription meds, all bought illegally, to get me through the days and nights of struggling with my feelings and thoughts.

Last week I found out my Dealer had ""vanished"", probably got caught or made enough money to stop selling. I went in to full blown panic as my ""stash"" was running very low and had planned on getting more Cannabis and maybe a couple of other things depending on what he had available.

Well today I am down to my final tiny bit of Cannabis, enough for just 1 hit. I have 4 Diazepam pills and 1 Pregabalin pill left over. I'll sleep tonight but know that going forward it is going to be a rough ride starting tomorrow night.

One good thing I did do last week though was speak to my Dr and explained my situation. I told them about the self medicating I had been doing for several years and asked for help. I felt extreme shame telling them my story but was surprised at how kind and understanding they were. I thought for years I'd be labeled a ""Junkie"" or something but I wasn't.

After my story my Dr said she is going to start me on Sertraline and warned me that it will take a month or so to feel any benefit from it. I had been feeling good getting everything off my chest up to this point. This last statement really made me scared.

Now I have to go through Cannabis Withdrawal, which lasts around 4 - 6 weeks for me, whilst getting used to the Sertraline which takes 4 - 6 weeks to kick in. I know I'm in for a really rough ride and I'm the one to blame for this for not going to my Dr 7 years ago before I started with Drugs.

Over the years I've basically forgotten how to sleep without at least some Cannabis in my system. The other stuff was just drugs to have on hand for emergencies if the Cannabis wasn't enough to ease my anxiety. So whilst I'm glad I'm not going to go into Benzo or Opiate withdrawal, I'm really scared about not having Cannabis in my life anymore. It was my crutch for so long, it would take away my anxiety within 5 minutes of smoking it.

To anyone who has read all my post, please learn from my mistakes. Taking Drugs illegally only helps in the short term. Before long you're hooked and when the time comes that you can't get any more the anxiety gets so much worse than it was before. I just pray that Sertraline will help me to overcome the issues I've suffered all my life alongside Talk Therapy.

My advice, ignore them... focus on yourself and those you trust. Only you know you, and those that you trust know more about you than some random person online with old world views.

I keep reading about 15 and 16-year-olds suffering from brain fog, anxiety, depression, even suicidal thoughts. That terrifies me. These are kids. What’s happening to us?

Is it really just social media messing with our brains? Is it COVID and the long-term psychological or even physical effects? Is it the state of the world—economically, socially, environmentally? Or are we just becoming more aware of mental health issues that always existed?

I know part of it is the overwhelming amount of technology in our lives—how it’s created this weird paradox where we’re constantly connected but feel more isolated than ever. It’s like we’re surrounded by people online but starved for real connection in real life.

I mean, I’m sure if you were living 200 years ago, these things didn’t exist, right? Or at least not at this scale. People weren’t constantly anxious, mentally burnt out, or numb at 16. What the hell is going on?

However when symptoms are actually on display, even for something as well known as depression or anxiety, you’re suddenly overreacting and it isn’t okay? 

For example I’m not shy about the fact that I’m anxious and have an anxiety disorder, I let people know especially before when I first start jobs because I feel people deserve a heads up. When I tell people it’s always this supportive vibe, that it’s nothing to be ashamed of, that we’re here if you need anything, etc. but then when I’m having a random panic attack and need to step away for a moment to calm down I’m treated like I’m being irrational, that whatever I’m going through isn’t that big of a deal, or that I should just deal with it. 

It feels like people with mental health issues are only allowed to show surface level, easy to digest symptoms(if even that) but when the very real and difficult symptoms rears its head people do a 180 and low key treat you like a freak or that you’re, well, crazy. 

It’s like…yeah no shit, what did you expect?

I’m at the point now where I know, for my mental well-being and sanity, it’s best to stop for good.

I have anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. Everything really escalated last year after a concussion — intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and depression. Over the past year, I’ve made huge progress through therapy, medication, and self-work. I stopped smoking during that time, but once I felt “better,” I picked it up again.

mentalhealth,1mgizuy,I hate my country. The way people with mental health issues are treated is absolutely abhorrent.,"I know it's also bad in the west but there, at least it's not considered a moral failure to be on SSRIs or anxiety medication and it's normal to go to therapy.

Meanwhile in my home country Bulgaria, most people's idea of mental health is from the Dark Ages. If you see a therapist,  you are considered a danger to society!

Whenever I bring up issues with my country in Bulgaria's subreddit like the healthcare, the horrible infrastructure, and how rude people are, the users immediately rummage through my post history and insult me for being on SSRIs to invalidate my opinion. I have received numerous insults, and when I expressed how this behaviour was absolutely horrible, I was called a ""sch*zo""

mentalhealth,1mocu8f,Really need advice/help dealing with my declining mental health,"I’m sorry for the long post, I will try to make this as brief as possible.

I need advice on how to navigate my terrible mental health. For background, I was diagnosed with PMDD, but sometimes I feel like it goes beyond that, and possibly isn’t even that.

I go through times where I think VERY negative thought and have very bad anxiety. I doubt my marriage, even though we are very happy and healthy. I hyper fixate on the thought of my husband cheating on me. It consumed my thoughts and whenever I’m around him, I watch his every move over analyzing what he’s doing, and in turn over thinking that he’s cheating. Like watching how he’s typing on his phone, where/who he’s looking at in public, his body language when he’s saying things etc. I want to preface, he has never given me a reason to ever believe he would cheat on me.

This also leads me to my jealousy issues. If there is a women in the room I think is more pretty than me, it’s all I can think about and I create in my head that my husband is into this person and wants her. I think every girl thinks my husband is attractive and wants to take him from me. 

Aside from that, I wake up most mornings with really bad morning depression. This goes away throughout the day, but it’s terrible. I think about how much I hate my job (even tho I love it), how badly I don’t want children (my husband and I are planning to have kids soon. The thought of having children typically makes me VERY excited) and I doubt everything about my marriage. Such as is he the right one? Is this what I really want? Etc 

When I’m not dealing with the above, it’s a constant battle in my head of negative thoughts and feelings. I can go from being really happy and grateful for my life, to hating every aspect. It feels like it never ever stops. 

Typically this all occurs 11 days before my period and lasts until I get my period. But recently it’s getting worse and I’m feeling these things the week I’m supposed to be my happiest (follicular phase). 

I feel so hopeless and some days I break down because I’m so over whelmed with trying to deal with all the emotions and anxiety. 

I had a therapist for 1.5 years, but unfortunately she said/did some things that make me had to cut her off. Sometimes I feel like a therapist won’t even be able to help.

mentalhealth,1eqiwx5,Anyone grieving their “youger years” due to mental health issues?,"I’m turning 26 (still relatively young I guess?) this year and I’m lucky enough to have had a comfortable life, educated with a diploma, in a happy relationship and comes from an above average income family.

I’ve had depression and anxiety for a very long time, due to bullying, emotional neglect and some abusive rs, got diagnosed with it when I was 18

Honestly, sometimes I wish the world just ended at times hahaha

I try to maintain an optimistic attitude in life and have gotten by somewhat, but only now I sorta am getting my stuff together 

It’s just that recently I realised that I have been “grieving?” my childhood and teenage years, I feel like i could’ve done so much more and enjoyed more, but cause of my issues I was always so scared of things and it led to bad choices as I got older

There are some days cause of this “grieving” I feel like Im filled in this sense of rage and incredible sadness

Idk if it’s just me, but I just wanted to know if there’s people out there that feels the same?

Any replies would be appreciated :)


Edit: MEGA HUGE THANKS TO ALL THAT REPLIED🤍
it helps a lot to know that I’m not alone, it’s my first Reddit post and I didn’t expect so many comments

I hope every single one of you out there gets all the love and joy you deserve and more

mentalhealth,1md96hu,"You've just had your intake session with a new mental health therapist. He's 20 years younger than you, has been out of grad school for only about 3 months, and has shared with you that he is a recovering addict. After a single visit, you're conflicted. Do you stay or go?","*This is a complex situation with a great deal of background that I'll likely omit for brevity's sake. Please, be patient and bear with me.*

I saw my latest therapist - let's call him Bailey (not his real name) - for the first time yesterday morning. The experience is still very fresh, and it's been weighing on my mind ever since. Overall, Bailey seemed a warm, welcoming, empathetic, and active listener with a genuine interest in helping me. Here's the rub. He is about 20 years younger than I, has been practicing for a very short time (think months, not years), and admitted to me during our intake session that he is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.

I know. That's a lot. It shouldn't surprise you that I left our session with alarm bells blaring in my head and an assload of red flags.

My initial reaction is to cut bait and go. That Bailey is not a good fit. Possibly on his way to being a good, even great therapist, but he's simply not there yet and, right now, not for me. That we won't be able to make the connection that I need to progress on my mental health journey.

And then there's the part of me that's urging patience. Gently asking me to pump the brakes. Don't jump the gun, rush to conclusions, or make any rash decisions based on a single intake session. Young and inexperienced can be good. Different perspectives and all. Perhaps what I've framed as negative could be beneficial.

I'm leaning heavily in one direction, but I remain torn. Conflicted. Can this type of dynamic ever work? What are your experiences with this kind of situation? How can I expect to relate to a therapist like Bailey? To a person young enough to be my son. And, while I'm proud of him for addressing his issues with substance abuse, that's some serious baggage to bring along on this trip.

Thoughts?

**Some brief background on me.**

I'm a 51-year-old cisgender white male. I struggle with depression and anxiety and have for about 5 years, with a particular ramp-up following a pair of strokes I had when I was 47. I've been out of work for over two years now. A combination of mental and physical health issues, coupled with my age and a genuinely messed-up job market, is the reason for the lengthy unemployment.

My experience with the mental health profession has been spotty and inconsistent. I've seen three MHPs over as many years. A wide variety of ages, races, genders, and experience levels. Cis-gendered Hispanic female, 30s, cis-gendered white male, mid-50s, non-binary, black, late 20s. I won't go into further details for each therapist; suffice it to say that my average therapeutic relationship lasted about 3 sessions.

I'll admit it. I'm a bit of a mess. I've got past traumas that I've failed to process, some serious shit that has negatively impacted my life and my marriage, and continues to hold me hostage.

I'm talking childhood abuse, a history of co-dependency, and a sprinkling of addictive behavior, just to name a few. I'm utterly stuck, overwhelmed by a ridiculous and all-pervasive sense of dread and hopelessness, and I can't move on. I no longer feel like I belong in my country (the US), half of whose population has lost their damn minds. I become angry whenever I leave the house (which is rare), I have no friends, I'm estranged from my family...you see what I mean.

Hello, first time posting here. I’m a 22 year old woman, only child of immigrants in USA and I’ve been clinically diagnosed by a trauma specialist with cPTSD and I have severe anxiety and depression. I also recently asked my therapist why am I not diagnosed with BPD and she said even though it appears that way…she wanted to assess and manage my PTSD first, then she’d be able to assess me better. But she told me I did meet the criteria for the diagnosis. 
I don’t want to make BPD my entire personality, and while I do resonate with a lot of the symptoms. For some reason I suspect I might just have Autism and ptsd which mimics BPD. 

Rant/ problem: 

I honestly noticed I don’t wanna be open anymore. I get highly triggered when it’s time for me to be vulnerable, I think it’s because when I am open, people perceive me, and try to suggest me something and I feel judged and overall I get upset because I feel like no one can truly  help me with their suggestions. However I believe people help me when they spend time with me because I’m so obsessed with friends. 

I also noticed I hate that people believe in me and want to help me, it really makes my blood boil. It makes me feel so negative and I feel full of shame. It motivates me to prove them wrong, I wanna show them that I actually am a true failure and that I am loser. My self sabotage is really intense. I’ve already self sabotaged two job opportunities this past month. For context I’m very poor, and been unemployed and depressed for a year. I know getting a job will literally propel me to heal, but I am really addicted to my own suffering and I’m addicted to not taking accountability or control.

mentalhealth,1nop3ba,Opening Up About Dual Diagnosis (Mental Health + Substance Use),"I just want to talk about something that doesn’t get enough space in conversations—what it’s like when mental health struggles and substance use show up together.  
  
For some, it starts with anxiety, depression, PTSD, or bipolar disorder—and using alcohol or drugs feels like the only way to cope. For others, substance use comes first, but over time it fuels or triggers mental health symptoms. Either way, both are real, both are exhausting, and they can feed off each other in a way that makes it hard to know where one ends and the other begins.  
  
The truth is, treating one and ignoring the other rarely works. What actually helps is an approach that sees the full picture—addressing both at the same time, with therapy, support, medication when needed, and a lot of patience.

mentalhealth,1mwylem,My mental and physical health has been plummeting for two years because of my job.,"I have had a job for almost three years. I had a lot of social anxiety when I started, but little by little I overcame it.

But I started to have a lot of work stress. There was a lot of work overload (it is an office job) and many work problems (great disorganization, rigid procedures, many incidents...).

I thought that, with time, everything would get better. I just had to try hard and everything would get better.

Time passed and more things did not go for the better. There were people who got angry with me simply because I worked well (I wanted things to work better, so I communicated things that needed to be done differently, etc.).

A colleague started doing almost none of the work, so I did my work and hers.

Time was passing.
My stress was increasing. I had to take some sick leave due to anxiety.
It began to be difficult for me to sleep at night and I could no longer disconnect from work when I went home.

I stopped doing the things I liked to do, because I was exhausted.
I stopped talking to my mother on the phone, because I didn't have enough energy.
I started arguing with my partner.
I started sleeping every afternoon when I got home.

I have chronic back pain (I have hyperlordosis, scoliosis and cervical straightening and trapped nerves that cause headaches and a lot of pain). These pains were increasing. I have to do rehabilitation every day, and I have to go to physical therapists regularly, but I was so exhausted that I couldn't do any of that and I felt worse and worse.

I can't go on vacation, because I take vacations when I can't take it anymore and I spend them at home sleeping.

Right now I feel deeply depressed, anxious, I never disconnect from work.

Plus, I now have a job where I have to do all the tasks I did before, plus many other tasks that are very stressful.

Furthermore, I am responsible for a safe with cash in which 1800 euros have disappeared, and the only other person who has access to that box is the manager.

My job is stressful, exhausting, it gives me a feeling of vulnerability, insecurity, constant stress, I am depressed, anxious.

I want to change jobs, but in my case mobility is not easy: it could take several months before I can change due to circumstances that take a long time to explain.

I'm thinking about taking a sick leave due to anxiety, spending several months off work and then changing jobs.

I feel like I can't take it anymore, that my life no longer has meaning.

The only thing I have done for months is work, smoke a lot, sleep in the afternoons, be very sad and stressed, have tachycardia every day, have very poor circulation and a lot of pain because I can't take care of myself.

mentalhealth,1nnwws7,The Christmas Table and the Battlefield: A Reflection on Addiction and Mental Health,"Addiction isn’t always about chasing a high. Sometimes, it’s about chasing silence ... the kind that finally hushes the noise of anxiety, depression, trauma, or whatever battle has been raging inside. For those who’ve lived with mental illness, finding something that works ... a vise that actually brings peace ... can feel like being pulled from the trenches and placed at a Christmas dinner table. There’s warmth, laughter, mashed potatoes. You can’t believe you made it. And you’d do anything not to go back.

That’s why I take photos on my good days. They’re like a soldier’s photo of their sweetheart ... something to clutch when the world goes dark. Proof that joy exists. That I’ve touched it. That it’s worth fighting for.

When someone finds a vise that works ... really works ... it’s not just relief. It’s rescue. And once they’ve felt that kind of peace, they’ll do anything to stay there. The “high” becomes a safe place, a memory they want to live inside.

Now imagine someone who’s finally stable thanks to medication. They’re sleeping. Laughing. Living. But then their insurance changes. Or they move. Or the system fails them in some quiet, cruel way. They hear whispers ... that a certain vise mimics the effects of their prescription. So they try it. And for a while, it works. They’re back at the Christmas table.

But unlike a prescription, there’s no doctor to guide the dosage. No safety net. So they start adjusting it themselves ... a little more, then a little more. Eventually, the vise begins to take more than it gives. But by then, they’re too far in to notice. Or too tired to care.

It’s like a soldier who sees a mirage of their loved one across enemy lines ... a flicker of hope in hostile territory. They chase it, believing it will lead them home. But they cross too far. And before they realize it, they’re trapped. What started as a search for comfort becomes captivity.

And for some, the battlefield isn’t metaphorical. Veterans carry memories that don’t fade. Their pain ... physical, emotional, spiritual ... can lead them to seek escape in similar ways. They wander from one battlefield to another, even when the war is over.

The same compassion belongs to those living with chronic physical pain. The need to escape suffering ... whatever its source ... is deeply human. Addiction, in these cases, isn’t indulgence. It’s relief. It’s survival.

When we begin to see addiction not as a moral failing but as a response to pain, we open the door to understanding. Compassion doesn’t excuse harm, but it helps explain it. And through that understanding, more humane paths to healing can emerge.",1,0,addiction isn t always about chasing a high sometimes it s about chasing silence the kind that finally hushes the noise of anxiety depression trauma or whatever battle has been raging inside for those who ve lived with mental illness finding something that works a vise that actually brings peace can feel like being pulled from the trenches and placed at a christmas dinner table there s warmth laughter mashed potatoes you can t believe you made it and you d do anything not to go back that s why i take photos on my good days they re like a soldier s photo of their sweetheart something to clutch when the world goes dark proof that joy exists that i ve touched it that it s worth fighting for when someone finds a vise that works really works it s not just relief it s rescue and once they ve felt that kind of peace they ll do anything to stay there the high becomes a safe place a memory they want to live inside now imagine someone who s finally stable thanks to medication they re sleeping laughing living but then their insurance changes or they move or the system fails them in some quiet cruel way they hear whispers that a certain vise mimics the effects of their prescription so they try it and for a while it works they re back at the christmas table but unlike a prescription there s no doctor to guide the dosage no safety net so they start adjusting it themselves a little more then a little more eventually the vise begins to take more than it gives but by then they re too far in to notice or too tired to care it s like a soldier who sees a mirage of their loved one across enemy lines a flicker of hope in hostile territory they chase it believing it will lead them home but they cross too far and before they realize it they re trapped what started as a search for comfort becomes captivity and for some the battlefield isn t metaphorical veterans carry memories that don t fade their pain physical emotional spiritual can lead them to seek escape in similar ways they wander from one battlefield to another even when the war is over the same compassion belongs to those living with chronic physical pain the need to escape suffering whatever its source is deeply human addiction in these cases isn t indulgence it s relief it s survival when we begin to see addiction not as a moral failing but as a response to pain we open the door to understanding compassion doesn t excuse harm but it helps explain it and through that understanding more humane paths to healing can emerge,0.10207933370976847,-0.8808,NEGATIVE,0.9919185042381287,positive,negative,negative
mentalhealth,1nnq9y7,Let down with my mental health again,"I started taking Lexapro back in June. They were dissolvable pills, since I can’t swallow pills due to a choking incident when I was 3. 

The medication helped me so much. I found that my anxiety and depression had pretty much gone away. I was able to talk to people without feeling anxious. I didn’t wake up every day feeling miserable anymore. 

I called my pharmacy today to inquire about the pills, since they stated they wouldn’t be available anymore, but I assumed it was a certain mg that wouldn’t be available. 

I’m getting a box of 10 mgs (even though I need to have it upped because 10 just isn’t doing it for me) that’ll last me a month. The pharmacy said I had to use it sparingly because there’s no guarantee the company will make any more. 

I feel so defeated. 

I finally got a medication for my disorders that helped. I felt so hopeful and felt much better on the medication. But now it’s taken away from me. 

I just want to give up on taking it all together and I want to quit therapy. If I find help for my mental health but get it taken away time and time again, what’s the point in getting help again?

mentalhealth,1muz83q,Mental health problems people don’t talk about,"Just a disclaimer: I want to rant about the issue I am currently facing because I feel desperate and angry and really worried.
I got bipolar disorder diagnosis (never established if it was 1 or 2) about ~2 years ago maybe? Or one year. I had depression issues before and I was taking lexapro which did help and I actually didn’t mind it during hard times. Now during college as things were “escalating” in my behavior I got bipolar disorder diagnosis. Seroquel was prescribed and I started taking it last year at some point so it wasn’t even a full year of medication. 
My problem: now that I am out of college, living a calm and stable life, I realized I got a wrong diagnosis. Why am I saying this? Reasoning behind my problem is that 
1. I was in a state of mind where I was romanticizing mental illness under the influence of friends and social media.
2. I guess I was trying to “blame” my poor life choices on something more when in reality I never had a good support system, I had toxic friendships, toxic relationships, and overall really unhealthy environment that made me act out accordingly.
3. I do think I have some depression and anxiety issues from time to time, but would not categorize this with bipolar disorder.
4. I got diagnosis after talking to a psychiatrist for 1 HOUR, things like cultural factors, social factors, or any other factors that should’ve been considered were in fact, NOT. 
My problem is that I am currently tapering off my medication, and I am having insane withdrawal symptoms that actually prevent me from doing my every day tasks, I had to take a day off at work to sleep and relax because I am feeling ridiculously lightheaded and dizzy. By the way - when I had the diagnosis I never once failed to do a single every day activity which by definition of DSM should be considered when giving diagnosis - my drinking, my  poor decisions, none of it affected my life in any way. How can a licensed professional prescribe me such a serious medication after talking to me for 1 hour ? I am worried because what possible long term side effects can I have? This is just my rant and I promise you I’ve thought about this for a long time and considered all factors to say I’m 100% sure I got a wrong diagnosis.

mentalhealth,1ng4k4y,Mom keeps blaming herself for my mental health,"I was diagnosed with AVPD, BPD (now in remission), and depression very early, and was hospitalized once. I've been on a bunch of meds, but I'm kinda better now, slowly coming off everything, not going to therapy anymore.

My older sibling has some form of ocd/severe health anxiety for which I'm encouraging them to seek help.

(My eldest sibling is doing fine).

My mother has recently come to terms with my older sibling's problem.  
This has triggered something in her.  
She keeps saying how she has failed as a mother, how her entire life she never had a job so she could take care of us and failed at that, how I've already given her enough problems myself and it's only getting worse, stuff like that.

It's really heavy to hear, especially while I'm trying to be careful about my own mental health. I'm also unfortunately very emotionally attached to her.  
I get that, I get why she would think it's her fault, but what am I supposed to say to her?  
I feel like telling her ""no, you did a great job"" or ""it's not your fault"" simply won't register since she seems so stubborn about it- I tried telling her she needs to think about it when she's feeling calmer, but she insists she failed at the only thing she did in life.  
Also, I have no idea how this stuff works, whose ""fault"" it is. I think it's nobody's fault, a lot of things came into play, but she won't hear any of it.

And yes, I suppose she's always been overly anxious, I remember a number of mood swings and other emotional issues coming from her during my childhood. I think she's aware. But I'd never blame her, that never crossed my mind, so I don't think I gave her that idea at any point.

In case you're wondering, my father wasn't really there. I guess that played a role, but I fear mentioning it would make her still shift the blame on herself somehow.

She refuses to go to therapy, saying it's too late for her and how she doesn't have time (she does), and overall has a breakdown every time I mention therapy for her.

What can I tell her, how can I behave?  
If you're a parent of a mentally ill person, what would you like to hear from them?  
Alternatively, how can I cope with seeing her like that?

No fixed sleep schedule, frequent night wakings, sometimes waking in panic attacks with racing heart, cold sweats, and exhaustion. My energy swings from bursts of high drive to total burnout, often triggered by anything related to my mother — her voice, laughter, or behavior.

Emotionally, I cycle between intense anger (imagining shouting, breaking things), hypomanic highs (grand ideas, debates, feeling invincible), and deep depression or hopelessness. I also get intrusive thoughts about revenge, suicide, or huge achievements that would “prove my worth.” None are urgent plans, but they circle in my head constantly.

Socially, things collapsed. Friends and relatives sided with my mother, who has actively isolated me by building alliances and undermining my reputation. I cut off toxic connections, but now 90% of my relationships are gone. I’ve been in my room for 7 months, barely leaving, unemployed after being fired twice for low performance. My daily routine is just drinking mate, smoking, scrolling online, sometimes masturbating, and avoiding light or outside contact. Hygiene suffered badly during my lowest point, when I also attempted suicide two months ago.

I live in Syria, where society has been under years of economic, cultural, and ideological crises. It’s a conservative environment that gives mothers exaggerated social status and authority — no one dares to challenge them. My mother uses this to her advantage, and my financial situation is dire: I’m fully dependent on my parents’ money, with no realistic way to become independent right now.

Attempts to get help from family failed — my sister idolizes my mother, my aunt is similar to her, my father is submissive and relieved I take the brunt of her toxicity. I feel like my life is a closed loop with no safe space, no allies, and no realistic path forward. I’m scared I’ll either have a full nervous breakdown or do something destructive.

Given this long-term, worsening situation, what can someone in my position actually do to break out of it? I’ve tried cutting toxic people, but isolation is crushing me. I’m not looking for “just think positive” — I need realistic, actionable ideas from anyone who’s been through something like this.",2,0,i ve been living for over a decade with extreme sleep problems unpredictable mood swings and constant anxiety no fixed sleep schedule frequent night wakings sometimes waking in panic attacks with racing heart cold sweats and exhaustion my energy swings from bursts of high drive to total burnout often triggered by anything related to my mother her voice laughter or behavior emotionally i cycle between intense anger imagining shouting breaking things hypomanic highs grand ideas debates feeling invincible and deep depression or hopelessness i also get intrusive thoughts about revenge suicide or huge achievements that would prove my worth none are urgent plans but they circle in my head constantly socially things collapsed friends and relatives sided with my mother who has actively isolated me by building alliances and undermining my reputation i cut off toxic connections but now of my relationships are gone i ve been in my room for months barely leaving unemployed after being fired twice for low performance my daily routine is just drinking mate smoking scrolling online sometimes masturbating and avoiding light or outside contact hygiene suffered badly during my lowest point when i also attempted suicide two months ago i live in syria where society has been under years of economic cultural and ideological crises it s a conservative environment that gives mothers exaggerated social status and authority no one dares to challenge them my mother uses this to her advantage and my financial situation is dire i m fully dependent on my parents money with no realistic way to become independent right now attempts to get help from family failed my sister idolizes my mother my aunt is similar to her my father is submissive and relieved i take the brunt of her toxicity i feel like my life is a closed loop with no safe space no allies and no realistic path forward i m scared i ll either have a full nervous breakdown or do something destructive given this long term worsening situation what can someone in my position actually do to break out of it i ve tried cutting toxic people but isolation is crushing me i m not looking for just think positive i need realistic actionable ideas from anyone who s been through something like this,-0.0260648409561453,-0.9968,NEGATIVE,0.99739009141922,neutral,negative,negative
mentalhealth,1n86k4p,Mental Health Struggles and a Possible Big Move—Looking for Advice,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice on a pretty big decision I’m facing, and I’m feeling really stuck and unsure. I’ll try to give some context and background, and I’d love any thoughts or advice you might have.
I (23M) live in California with my parents, and for the past year or so I’ve been struggling really badly with depression and social anxiety. It’s gotten worse over time, even after seeing a therapist for the past 6 months and trying different medications—nothing seems to be helping. I’ve been feeling pretty isolated and stuck in my routine, and it’s hard to find excitement or motivation for anything anymore.

Recently, I went on a vacation to Michigan to visit my brother, his wife, and their kids. Honestly, before going, I wasn’t really excited about the trip, but once I got there, everything felt different. I felt like a completely new person—happy, social, and able to engage with people in ways I hadn’t been able to in years(or ever honestly). My sister, who came with me, even said I seemed like a totally different person. It was such a stark contrast to how I’ve been feeling at home.

Since my brother moved out there he has been trying to get me to move there , and after spending time there, I actually considered it seriously for the first time. When I got back to California, I talked to my work about transferring, and they said it’s possible. I also decided to bring it up to my mom, though I was really nervous. She took it harder than I expected, saying it would break her heart if I moved that far away. That conversation left me feeling really conflicted and unsure about what to do next. I haven’t told my dad yet, and I’m really nervous about how he might react.
Since then, I’ve had more conversations with my mom, and she’s started to open up more to the idea. She says she just wants me to do what’s best for me and wants me to be happy, which is reassuring. I truly feel like I could be happy living in Michigan, especially after seeing how different I felt there. I’m starting to think moving could be the best thing for me—mentally and emotionally. I’ve already checked with my work, and a transfer seems like a real possibility.

On top of that, my brother mentioned while I was there that if I decide to move, it would be rent-free for me at his place. That’s a huge help financially, but I’m still feeling unsure about the logistics and how to approach my brother about the specifics.
I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation—making a big move for your mental health or a fresh start, and how you approached it. Also, I’d really appreciate any advice on how to talk to my brother about moving in rent-free and maybe asking him about other details that would help me feel more comfortable with the decision (e.g., financial expectations, what my role would be in the house, etc.).

Thanks for reading, and I’m really grateful for any advice or support you can offer.

mentalhealth,1neoqf4,My adolescent child with mental health issues made some shocking accusations about me.,"A bit of history. My two children were very young when their mother took her own life, leaving me as their sole parent/caregiver. This of course has had its trials and tribulations over the years. But I muddled through as best I could.

My oldest adolescent child has been in and out of therapy with counselors and therapists and psychologists since they were 8. Constant issues with going to school. They eventually were diagnosed with OCD, PTSD (an incident where a serious accident was witnessed), severe depression and anxiety, and as of late led to suicidal ideations where they were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital.

After several days in the hospital, they were discharged to a partial hospitalization program. My child did not want to go. They said they thought regular outpatient therapy would suffice. I contested and said I think they should go through the partial program, at least they could spend evenings at home. This led to a lot of emotional discussion.

Part of their discussion, they mentioned how a big part of their problem was me, and how abusive I was, verbally and physically. This shocked me. My entire life flashed before my eyes, thinking of any time that I had done something that may have been construed as such. I was devastated. They said they were afraid to approach me about their concerns because I'd get mad or hit them.

I asked for examples and many I couldn't remember, but I believe what they were saying was true (from their viewpoint at least). But of the couple times I did remember the examples they provided, I had my own vision of the events. While I may not have been a stellar parent, I never did anything that I considered intentionally harming my children. Ever. Would I raise my voice when they acted up, sure. Did I flick them in the head when they wouldn't calm down, sure. Would I drag them by their ankles to get them out of bed in the morning for school when they resisted. Yep. Did I use some serious reality checks when things got out of hand. Yes.

But regardless of what I think and what I know I did or didn't do, this is their perception. Me as a monster. Maybe I am this monster, and that thought is something that made me literally sick to my stomach. I created this problem for my child. I'm beside myself and not sure if any kind of therapy can correct this.

There's nothing I can say or do to unwind this. Of all the years in with therapists, this never came up. I allowed them to speak privately with their therapist and psychiatrists over the years because I always wanted them to feel comfortable expressing concerns that they might have been afraid to say in front of me. Even though I always felt we had a pretty open relationship. So I don't know what to do.

My other younger child had some depressive episodes and has ADHD. They struggled with school for a while shortly after the COVID pandemic. Now I feel my youngest is doing much better. But still struggles with school.

I guess I don't know what I'm saying or asking. Just what level of support do we need to move forward? How do I address this monster that I have been to them. I don't want to say that I am innocent in all this. They are my children and I failed them. But I at least want them to be able to live a great life without the mental burden of my horrible parenting.",1,0,a bit of history my two children were very young when their mother took her own life leaving me as their sole parent caregiver this of course has had its trials and tribulations over the years but i muddled through as best i could my oldest adolescent child has been in and out of therapy with counselors and therapists and psychologists since they were constant issues with going to school they eventually were diagnosed with ocd ptsd an incident where a serious accident was witnessed severe depression and anxiety and as of late led to suicidal ideations where they were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital after several days in the hospital they were discharged to a partial hospitalization program my child did not want to go they said they thought regular outpatient therapy would suffice i contested and said i think they should go through the partial program at least they could spend evenings at home this led to a lot of emotional discussion part of their discussion they mentioned how a big part of their problem was me and how abusive i was verbally and physically this shocked me my entire life flashed before my eyes thinking of any time that i had done something that may have been construed as such i was devastated they said they were afraid to approach me about their concerns because i'd get mad or hit them i asked for examples and many i couldn't remember but i believe what they were saying was true from their viewpoint at least but of the couple times i did remember the examples they provided i had my own vision of the events while i may not have been a stellar parent i never did anything that i considered intentionally harming my children ever would i raise my voice when they acted up sure did i flick them in the head when they wouldn't calm down sure would i drag them by their ankles to get them out of bed in the morning for school when they resisted yep did i use some serious reality checks when things got out of hand yes but regardless of what i think and what i know i did or didn't do this is their perception me as a monster maybe i am this monster and that thought is something that made me literally sick to my stomach i created this problem for my child i'm beside myself and not sure if any kind of therapy can correct this there's nothing i can say or do to unwind this of all the years in with therapists this never came up i allowed them to speak privately with their therapist and psychiatrists over the years because i always wanted them to feel comfortable expressing concerns that they might have been afraid to say in front of me even though i always felt we had a pretty open relationship so i don't know what to do my other younger child had some depressive episodes and has adhd they struggled with school for a while shortly after the covid pandemic now i feel my youngest is doing much better but still struggles with school i guess i don't know what i'm saying or asking just what level of support do we need to move forward how do i address this monster that i have been to them i don't want to say that i am innocent in all this they are my children and i failed them but i at least want them to be able to live a great life without the mental burden of my horrible parenting,0.017252072546190194,-0.9702,NEGATIVE,0.9846854209899902,neutral,negative,negative
mentalhealth,1db04es,Men's Mental Health Month,"https://preview.redd.it/a1nzvd2tjb5d1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d42e896a065c8cac531a7cce83826241cef673

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because **they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.



https://preview.redd.it/ft787mdkqb5d1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=149a484e1ba75ac2136dbdf6c81a3f4b558601d6

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I’ve learnt to deal with it', 'I don’t wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‘I have no-one to talk to’. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story. While we are on the topic of being anonymous, it is totally okay to create a new Reddit account and post here on that alt account!

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!    
  
If you are struggling, it would be helpful to visit your local healthcare provider. But doing that can be scary.  
You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel. In both cases, this [article](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider), will give you some tips and tools on how to talk to your primary care provider. You deserve to be seen and heard!

r/mentalhealth is a peer to peer support subreddit. Please share in the comments what has helped you!  
This can be a podcast/music/a video/a book/an article or an app (yes we will screen them for promotions).   
Or you are more than welcome to share your story on how you approached getting help IRL. Was it as difficult as you maybe thought. Would you do something different? What was the response you have gotten after asking for help? 

And if you need help, please let us know what you are dealing with. So others can give you some tips on what worked for them. Or maybe they recognize themselves in your story! 

Aside from awareness, we hope this can spark a conversation on the topic. Because conversations and connecting with eachother is what we are all about.

mentalhealth,1ndze06,Mental health resources for an autistic adult?,"Hello. I am wondering if anyone knows of any mental health resources specifically for people with autism? 

Long story short, I was receiving services paid for by vocational rehab in my state from the organization called AANE (the specific program was called LifeMap Coaching). Unfortunately, vocational rehab cut this service due to budget cuts in my state. I was told by my states disability services department that they cannot fund the service for me as they have a grant that says it’s for autism ONLY individuals, and unfortunately I have autism and an intellectual disability. Because I lost this service, I am feeling very lost and uncertain how to move forward, and it is definitely impacting my mental health. I am in therapy, but I only see my therapist once a week. I am also on medication but I don’t know if it helps enough. So honestly I’m just struggling a lot and it is impacting my anxiety a great deal. Some days, I honestly felt the life coaching was helping me even more than therapy!

If I am being honest, losing coaching feels very “unfair”. (Well, that’s probably not the best word to describe it, but it’s the word I can come up with in this moment.)
When I had coaching, I was learning coping skills for being a recently diagnosed autistic adult, and now that I no longer have coaching, I suppose I don’t know how to cope in this world, especially since it seems that this world is not made for people who are neurodivergent. It just plain stinks. That’s all I can say.

Furthermore, I can’t be the only person receiving disability services in my state that has both Autism and an intellectual disability. I am sure that there are other angry/upset families out there being impacted by this. 

Anyhow, I just feel really lost (and kind of depressed/anxious if I am being honest) without the support that life coaching with AANE provided, and I am trying to explore every possible avenue I can to get it back, as not having this service is taking a toll on my mental health unfortunately, and I am unsure how to move forward…

The BEST way I can describe it, is that when I was working with the life coach, I actually felt like I may be able to accomplish something in my life, and I grew to love our sessions together. Now that I no longer have coaching sessions with the life coach, I just feel that I am floundering in life, and I am not sure how I can learn to be successful, especially as an adult living with autism. I also feel that if I was diagnosed with autism as a young child, I wouldn’t be having these issues that I am experiencing since I was diagnosed with autism only last year. And I feel that me being successful has been “ripped away from me” in some ways. I just don’t know what to do. I suppose therapy does help somewhat, but it’s kind of complicated because it’s not geared at people with Autism, even though my therapist is on the spectrum. I have more deep feelings on this too, but it’s hard for me to put into words since I am so upset. 

I can’t stress enough how much life coaching really helped me out, and I don’t know what to do now that I lost this service. 

I will try and hang in there, but if I am being honest it is very hard, and I am unsure how to best move forward with this situation…I wish I had more answers.

mentalhealth,1nceo2d,Why is mental health care in Jaipur (and Rajasthan in general) still so underdeveloped?,"It feels like such a contradiction—on one hand, awareness about anxiety, depression, and therapy has definitely grown (especially post-COVID). The government has even mandated registration of mental health centres and announced new 10-bed wards in district hospitals

But the reality on the ground?

Major labour shortages—barely any trained psychiatrists/clinical psychologists compared to demand.

Stigma—people still hesitate to seek help openly.

mentalhealth,1m3fywo,My GF cannot hold a job due to mental health issues,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I, 20 M, cannot figure out how to help my GF, 19 F. She struggles with depression, anxiety, and factors of AUDHD. I've been with her for about 2 years, and am aware of these. She has been on depression medication for a few years, but has lowered her dosage within the last year or so. 

The problem is, ever since she quit her last long-term job and moved out of her parents house in Summer 2024, she has not been able to hold a job for more than 2 months. She gets extremely nervous, to the point of tears, sobbing, or, more often, extreme nausea. She has an incredibly hard time with transitions, for example leaving the house, and this has made it very, very difficult for her to pay rent, go to work, among other things.

And it's not that she's lazy, or just doesn't want to work; she has had breakdowns where she is crying in my arms because she wants so badly to work, to pay rent, to lead a normal lifestyle of working, but some part of her just can't do it, and I'm not sure if its really anything I can help with, other than encouraging her to go to work.

I moved in with her in June, knowing these things, but thinking I could help; A lot of the time, support and gentle guiding helps her get out of the house. I feel like an asshole doing it, sometimes feeling like I am forcing her to go in, but it does get her to work, maybe 8/10 times. However, sometimes it just isn't enough, or isn't what she needs. I feel stuck, because I don't want to enable the behavior of calling out or quitting jobs, as it just adds to more stress for her, and we also need the money; I will be going to school in the Fall, and I simply cannot pay her side of the rent as well as my own. 

And I know that sometimes, I just can't help, or she isn't looking FOR help, but until I get a better job, we both need to work, and I want to try to mend this problem, even if it takes a long time. I love this woman so, so much, and would do anything for her. While this does put stress on me, I'm willing to sacrifice that in the long run if it means she has a better life to look forward to.

Any suggestions, comments or really anything would be so much appreciated.

For the past year I have been experiencing various mental health issues, (anxiety, depression, bipolar) Earlier in the year I had been going to a therapist and eventually stopped because I was starting to feel better, although this time around things feel ten times worse.


It is worth noting me and my partner are currently long distance as we are both pursuing things in school. But I can’t help but to keep overthinking about all the small things, and am also struggling with trying to deal with change. (We only became long distance recently)

Everytime I overthink it throws me into an episode where I start experiencing severe anxiety, and enter a depression state for up to days at a time. 

I honestly feel really bad for my partner and I don’t want to put them through this. I am unsure how to continue going on like this because I feel like I am becoming a burden or too much to handle every-time these episodes come around. I completely shut down and don’t want to talk when I enter these episodes and I become so emotional. 

I feel like I need constant reassurance and all these other things but at the same I don’t wanna keep talking to my partner about this stuff because I fear they will become tired of me or figure I am too much or my issues are too much. So I have been trying to keep my feelings bottled and it doesn’t work.

mentalhealth,1mzlxmg,16.5 year old severe mental health,"TW: mental health, suicide

I'm 46f, stepmom to an almost 17m. Ive been a primary parent for 13 years, married to bio mom. He's with us 95% of the time and with Dad on occasion (no custody arrangement, dad is around sporadically). 

He has always struggled with emotions and we did therapy with him from about 7-10 years old. He then was resistant to therapy and got into athletics and was pretty well adjusted until recently. 
He started complaining about his brain and showed signs of dramatic mood swings. He shared bits about wanting to self harm and one night told me he couldn't tell what was reality or not. 
We decided to take him for a crisis eval. There we learned he attempted suicide a couple of nights previously and they recommended hospitalization. He also escalated rapidly, yelling, pounding walls, insulting everyone. He's been in a psych hospital for 5 days and they plan to keep him for 5 more days and he's being treated for depression and anxiety. 

He is livid with us. He won't talk to us. He finally called his dad tonight and said when he gets out he's running away to live with a friend's older brother. 

He's not yet 17. My wife is a wreck. We have worked really hard to take care of him, I'm worried he will drop out of high school, self harm, won't take his meds. 
Looking for any words of wisdom. He lost a friend to suicide earlier this year, has had a lot of support through school, we have a great therapist lined up. 

Anyone been through something like this? What can we do if he won't forgive him for getting him treatment?

I've been diagnosed with chronic PTSD, ADHD, depression/anxiety, and possibly Bipolar 2 or Borderline Personality Disorder. For the last 2.5 years I've been employed company (grocery) that take advantage of their most capable employees and expect them to pull extra weight for the employees who lack work ethic. Poorly managed and hostile work environment. Also, they've given me a terribly inhumane schedule. My 5 shifts within  1 week have varying start times between 3 AM and 11 AM, and finish times of 1PM - 7PM -  as well as random split days off. This schedule has taken a huge toll on my (already poor) mental health - no sleep rhythm, and inability to make plans/appointments or have a life. I have to work in 7 different departments on the regular, they bounce me around to fill whatever gap they need. 

Earlier this summer, a tragic accident occured at my house where I watched my friend choke to death on her food and had to comfort her 11 year old daughter, all which caused more PTSD. I got my psychiatrist to sign me off on 2 weeks medical leave. Then fought for a 2 week extension. Then fought for a  6 week extension (currently about to end), but the psychiatrist said this was the last extension and that she'd send me back to work with a medically modified schedule. I feel like I should get 6 months to 1 year of paid leave. My employer/union will allow up to 18 months, pending a doctor's certification. Is this unreasonable to ask?

mentalhealth,1nany1o,Worried and struggling with mental health and need support,"I'm a 19-year-old female, and I’ve been really struggling with my mental health lately. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and it has been extremely difficult, stressful, and exhausting—not just for me, but for those around me as well.

I’ve been feeling very depressed recently, which makes it hard for me to fall asleep. Yet, when I need to wake up, I can't bring myself to get out of bed. This leads to oversleeping, and I’m not enjoying life at all anymore, except for small moments with my boyfriend where I find some peace and happiness.

My anxiety has become so overwhelming that I can’t go to the store anymore, especially during the daytime. When I absolutely have to go, I wait until just before it closes to avoid large crowds. Even the smallest situations can trigger an anxiety attack—like having trouble finding something, too many people walking by, or feeling like someone is too close to me.

My ADHD is also challenging right now; I can't seem to focus on anything, and my impulses have been really bad and I can’t seem to control my emotions. I get angry very easily, and then I get mad at myself for getting angry about something minor. This cycle leads to me crying and feeling deep sadness, all because I reacted poorly to something trivial.

This situation is really scaring me because I don’t understand why I’ve been feeling this way lately. My boyfriend understandably finds it hard to grasp what I’m going through, especially since I struggle to communicate it properly. I’m about to see a therapist, but my appointment isn’t for a while.

mentalhealth,1n9nqg2,My mum refuses to acknowledge my mental health struggles and constantly projects her own physical illness onto me.,"Hey, I’ve struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember. I was an anxious, dysregulated child, and as I grew into my teens (I’m 19 now), I faced depressive episodes, OCD, anxiety, and now a restrictive eating disorder. I’ve been on medication in the past, and at 13 I was even sectioned after trying to take my own life.

Despite everything, my mum still denies it. She tells me I’m “not mentally ill” because she “knows.” For context: she has a B12 deficiency that causes her health issues, and she constantly uses this to dismiss my struggles, insisting that what I go through is the same as what she went through prior diagnosis.

When I’m depressed or anxious, she makes it about herself. She tells me I don’t know how I feel, pushes her own theories about what’s “really” wrong with me, and even suggested I lie to doctors to get tests she thinks I need. Her stance is always that I’m just nutritionally deficient and that explains everything.

Yes, I understand deficiencies can affect mood. But I’ve felt this way my entire life, long before my anorexia developed (she is even in denial of my ED too LOL) and I know my struggles go deeper than just being deficient in vitamins. 

My dad, on the other hand, has always been understanding and supportive, especially when I’ve been at my lowest and never discredited my mental struggles. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to cope with my mum’s invalidation. I’ve tried reasoning with her, but it only leaves me irritated and reinforces the idea that something is inherently “wrong” with me and that I can’t be fixed.

I’ve done a lot of self-regulating and pulled myself out of dark places before. I’ve seen many therapists and built strong self awareness around my mental state. But in moments of vulnerability and irrationality, it hurts that the one person who should love me unconditionally, doesn’t seem to.

mentalhealth,1n7w96j,Experiences starting dating at a later age due to mental health struggle? (M24),"M24. I've struggled with social anxiety and depression for my entire life, and was in a particularly dire period of self-inflicted isolation throughout college, but I have made significant progress in terms of my social skills and mental health in the last couple years. I've essentially climbed out of a pit I never thought I could, and have really gotten my life together in a way that I am happy with.

I am finally at a point where I am ready to begin dating, but I have no idea how to start at this age. Because of how I fell behind in my social development, I am still at a very teenage stage of anticipating milestones like my first date, my first kiss, my first girlfriend, etc. A very funny situation to come out of surviving.

I asked someone out for the very first time about a year ago, and although she turned me down, we remained friends and have actually grown much closer since then despite becoming long-distance. Most of my friends are women, and I've always generally gravitated that way. I haven't developed a romantic interest in anyone else since then, but I also haven't really had the opportunity until now.

I am concerned about squandering the natural environment of high school or university - I barely had any human interaction at the latter - and also that my romantic inexperience could understandably be a red flag. When I was younger, I liked the idea of having my first experiences with romance with someone else also experiencing their firsts, but obviously that's not really possible at this age.

In theory, I would much prefer for romance to be something that arises organically, but that has yet to happen and I would like to push myself to date deliberately. While I am hesitant for my first dating experiences to be off of an app, especially since I normally form a crush from getting to know a person rather than looks, I am open to it being the most realistic option.

I would love to hear about how other people, especially other dudes, have navigated figuring this stuff out at a later age!

I mean if there's mold or safety hazards that's one thing, but It feels like faking the appearance of Togetherness. I don't care about skincare. Fixating on my body and appearance and pores or whatever does not make me feel good. Neither does shaving my whole body or exfoliating 6 times. The sun is oppressive and kind of anxiety inducing. Too bright, too noisy. Here's what does help me:

\- therapy

\- talking to a friend on the phone. Usually just distracting/funny stuff

\- scrolling Instagram reels (not a perfect solution but has stopped major panic attacks, kept me from wanting to end it, saved me from the void, etc)

\- watching a LOT of trashy TV

\- exercise, but only if I have the mental energy to. If I don't, it does more damage and makes my disassociation worse

\- playing square x while listening to new albums I find on rate your music

\- playing guitar if I feel up to it

\- cold water on my face and especially pressing cold wet paper towels against my ears. The combined sensory of water against my head and the sound of it squishing into my ear distracts me a bit

\- prescription drugs that depress my central nervous system

basically, the mentality I run into a lot of ""oh if you just go through the motions of exercise, eating better, cleaning, etc, it will get you out of a rut"" I find irritating at best and seriously damaging at worst. I followed it for years never imagining I could just make my own rules.

mentalhealth,1n6icik,Our mental health is being negatively impacted by loneliness in silence.,"We frequently undervalue the impact that our social networks have on our mental and cognitive well-being. Not only is loneliness an emotional state, but it also alters how our brains work. Isolation can raise stress hormones, impair memory, and even increase the risk of anxiety and depression, according to studies.
Conversely, interacting with encouraging friends, family, or even participating in an online or offline community can improve resilience to stress, elevate mood, and prevent cognitive decline. Having meaningful relationships that make you feel seen and supported is more important than having hundreds of friends.
So if you’ve been feeling down or mentally exhausted, ask yourself: When was the last time I had a real conversation with someone I trust? Reaching out to just one person can make a difference.

mentalhealth,1n56sfj,I think my mom faked my mental health history for her own benefit,"Sorry it's so long😭

I (f20) was adopted by my grandparents at age 6. My grandmother has Bipolar depression. Growing up with her was hard. If she had a hard day at work it was taken out on me. My grandpa was like her puppy, he always took her side to save himself the trouble. Everyone kept quiet and just allowed her to treat everyone badly with the excuse of being bipolar. She HAD to be in control of everything around her. 

She put me in therapy, which was needed I came from a traumatic home life. The thing was, she was always in control of the therapy appointments. It was never about how I felt or what I went through. It was how she felt and what she thought I went through.

By the time I was 12 I had an entire list of diagnoses. All ones that she suggested. I was on multiple medications. All meds she suggested i be on. If a psychiatrist disagreed with her, I didn't see them again. She eventually kept me at the clinic she worked at with the psychiatrist and therapist she was friends with. I was diagnosed with 
ADHD 
ADD
ODD
Anxiety disorder 
Depression 
Pre bipolar (because they dont diagnose kids with bipolar) 
Borderline personality disorder (BPD)
PTSD
Attachment disorder
Hyperactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD)

 I got diagnosed with HSDD in high-school because she found out I lost my virginity. She said I had ""dangerous Sexual tendencies"". I had sex only a couple times with my boyfriend of 2 years. Very normal sex too, it wasnt anything crazy. When I wouldn't break up with him and started crying and begging her to stop when she forced me to not see him again, she said I had an unhealthy attachment to him and she was scared for my well-being. I was then diagnosed with an attachment disorder. 
 
I left home at 16 after she kicked me out again, got pregnant at 17 (birth control failed me) and came back home. I gave birth at 18.
 I struggled with PPD, this i know is true, it was horrible. She insisted she needed to be with me in my appointments, she did all the talking like always. By the end of the appointment I had 3 new diagnoses. PPD, PPR and ofc Bipolar. Just like her. Just like she had been saying since I was in elementary school. She insisted I be on the same medication as her. I was MISERABLE. I couldn't get out of bed after being on them, I couldn't care for my child. 

I stopped taking the meds and felt better, I soon moved 2 hours away. She absolutely flipped and said I was stealing my son away from her. I had to leave though. I got new Dr's and after I was finally able to tell my side and be fully open and honest for a few months, both the psychiatrist and therapist agreed I do not have bipolar or most of the diagnoses she put on me. I did have PPD, I do have ptsd. My long list of mental diagnoses got shortened to 2. They agreed they dont think I need medications and that counseling would really benefit me instead. She has tried many times to find the name of my Dr office and my Dr's so she can call and talk to them. She always has an excuse why she needs to speak with my Dr's. She has even tried to call my son's Dr office about his medical stuff. She begs for my patient portal login information.

mentalhealth,1mwz8bt,Rapidly declining mental health,"For clarification I [19F] had been living with depression for quite some time now along with anxiety which had got pretty bad back when I was 16, but had since then gone away. Ever since then I had to give up on going to college because my mom [47F] wanted me (and my sister of the same age) to stay home with her and help her with the house bills + paying off her credit cards + the car note because child support for my sister and I ran out and her SSI check isn't enough for all of the bills. This forced my sister and I to have to get jobs and give her around half of our paychecks each for her to help out and my mom always promises me that I'll be able to not have to worry about any of this when 'she gets all of this under control'. However, I'm skeptical because she has said that same thing since forever and I'm starting to think she's just filling my head with lies. 
Jump to a few months of this exact same thing later and I thought I would finally be able to escape and get my degree at an out of state college but she found out about it and started nagging me about how I'm not 'grown enough' to be out in the real world like a regular adult and I decided to cancel my admission and just stay home for the next upcoming year (and probably the next and the next and the next). 

I had to cancel my one way ticket out of this awful house and I couldn't even do it because of these stupid bills and because she (in her words) wants to keep me safe, but I feel like my brain is rotting. Every day I wake up, dodge my mom all day because seeing her face and hearing her breathe makes me agitated and anxious, doomscroll, and sleep.

And it doesn't help that all of my friends get to have a nice life, so seeing all of this is just making me feel worse, so I foolishly decided to just delete all of their contacts and now I can't get them back or remember them and the only person I have to really talk to without getting angry is myself. I'm starting to think that I might be talking to myself too much though, because all day every day I'm just mumbling to myself. I was even behind the cash register today at my new job just murmuring to myself but I can't stop.

But I'm just tired but not the type of tired that sleep can fix. I practically sleep all the time now in my free time, be it my antidepressants or just my overall depression and when I'm not doing that, as aforementioned, I just doomscroll and feel agitated. My agitation has even gotten to the point where my mom doesn't even have to be in my presence and I'll still hear her voice just being annoying. 
Beyond this though, it's a multitude of things that would take a long time to talk about, like my awful sleep habits, my poor appetite, intense mood swings, etc. 
It's just so tiring and I really just want to get away from it all. I've tried talking it out with my mom, and for a second, I thought it would get better, but something always ruins it. Since I don't have my license, my mom has to pick me up from work and she was also running her friend's errands (car broke down) and the first thing I do when I hop in the car was joke about how it feels like the customers just hate me and her friend talks about how I shouldn't say that next time I'm in the car with her or she would smack me in my mouth and my mom just looks back at me and laughs. I hate her friend so much, like, I know that my mom is insanely lonely and that friend is the only one she has, so I never say anything, but it just made my day worse",1,1,for clarification i f had been living with depression for quite some time now along with anxiety which had got pretty bad back when i was but had since then gone away ever since then i had to give up on going to college because my mom f wanted me and my sister of the same age to stay home with her and help her with the house bills paying off her credit cards the car note because child support for my sister and i ran out and her ssi check isn't enough for all of the bills this forced my sister and i to have to get jobs and give her around half of our paychecks each for her to help out and my mom always promises me that i'll be able to not have to worry about any of this when 'she gets all of this under control' however i'm skeptical because she has said that same thing since forever and i'm starting to think she's just filling my head with lies jump to a few months of this exact same thing later and i thought i would finally be able to escape and get my degree at an out of state college but she found out about it and started nagging me about how i'm not 'grown enough' to be out in the real world like a regular adult and i decided to cancel my admission and just stay home for the next upcoming year and probably the next and the next and the next i had to cancel my one way ticket out of this awful house and i couldn't even do it because of these stupid bills and because she in her words wants to keep me safe but i feel like my brain is rotting every day i wake up dodge my mom all day because seeing her face and hearing her breathe makes me agitated and anxious doomscroll and sleep and it doesn't help that all of my friends get to have a nice life so seeing all of this is just making me feel worse so i foolishly decided to just delete all of their contacts and now i can't get them back or remember them and the only person i have to really talk to without getting angry is myself i'm starting to think that i might be talking to myself too much though because all day every day i'm just mumbling to myself i was even behind the cash register today at my new job just murmuring to myself but i can't stop but i'm just tired but not the type of tired that sleep can fix i practically sleep all the time now in my free time be it my antidepressants or just my overall depression and when i'm not doing that as aforementioned i just doomscroll and feel agitated my agitation has even gotten to the point where my mom doesn't even have to be in my presence and i'll still hear her voice just being annoying beyond this though it's a multitude of things that would take a long time to talk about like my awful sleep habits my poor appetite intense mood swings etc it's just so tiring and i really just want to get away from it all i've tried talking it out with my mom and for a second i thought it would get better but something always ruins it since i don't have my license my mom has to pick me up from work and she was also running her friend's errands car broke down and the first thing i do when i hop in the car was joke about how it feels like the customers just hate me and her friend talks about how i shouldn't say that next time i'm in the car with her or she would smack me in my mouth and my mom just looks back at me and laughs i hate her friend so much like i know that my mom is insanely lonely and that friend is the only one she has so i never say anything but it just made my day worse,-0.08390251723585056,-0.9575,NEGATIVE,0.9979848861694336,negative,negative,negative
mentalhealth,1m5eg0k,I'm worried my mental health has made me a lolcow,"After everything that has happened to a certain 'streamer' of late, it got me thinking about all the harassment and bullying I've had over the years. I experience it in real life to still to this day. I'm diagnosed on the autism spectrum with learning difficulties, anxiety, OCD, and depression. I am willing to learn, it's just not easy to get it first try. 

The few areas that make me think I've become a lolcow are from Steam (the games storefront/library), Reddit and YouTube. Where I've been mocked for having mental health issues. 

On Steam, I used to write game reviews, where I criticized the lack of accessibility for someone like me who can spend hours figuring how to play something and not get anywhere. Because of that, I've had comments harassing me, and ""Jester awards"" which are for some reason Steam's way of saying you're a clown, and they have not exactly removed it despite its misuse.

Reddit, it feels like there's a lot more of it. Sometimes I ask a serious genuine question or make a post, then I'm not taken seriously by anyone. It's lead me to disable comments and block users who don't provide anything informative. When I try to understand from other's point of view, I'm mocked even more. Why is empathy wrong?

Then on YouTube, I sometimes get the odd troll comment which I either accept and use in a joking way. Other times it's mocking my voice where I do have a visible speech impairment. Most common ones I get are about food/dicks in my mouth. Which I jokingly accept anyway because I like both, so that doesn't work on me. I do my best not to let other comments get under my skin though, thanks to the power of critical thinking. Most videos are just not received well or recognized. I do my best to promote kindness and respect. Especially in the troubling times we are in now, for every side of a coin. 

  
I can't help but think all these years, I've become some sort of lolcow to people? In real life, people don't take me seriously. I have a some bad mood swings and people don't respect my space or time in situations like that. Just one example, I get support for things around the house. Two of the worst things that happen with that is 1. People come in without announcing or telling me they'll be coming in which puts me off speaking to anyone, especially when I want to be left alone. Not only that, I can't plan around their random visits, so I can't get support in that sense, either I'm busy or in the middle of something like gaming. The 2nd thing is the terrible communication. I struggle with speaking to people all the time, my sentences don't come out the way I thought they should be, so I ask to be messaged to plan my day (Tying into the 1st problem to an extent). But nothing. 9 times out of 10 that is completely ignored. So that causes me to have a meltdown. As a result of all of this, my blood pressure is really high. My highest is 150 over 90 (or 75, can't remember), I'm only 28 years old. 

Then countless doctors appointments, some MISSED because of the above issues, but other appointments have failed to address the problem and treat it, because they rush me out the door with a prescription... well they're not doctors actually, in the UK, they're called GP's, which are not actually doctors. So we're fucked there.

Just like physical health, our mental well-being determines how effectively we handle stress, build relationships, and make decisions. In today’s fast-paced world, challenges such as work pressure, academic demands, and family responsibilities often create emotional strain. Prioritizing mental health helps us stay balanced, focused, and motivated.

Good mental health improves productivity, enhances self-confidence, and promotes stronger connections with others. On the other hand, neglecting it can lead to anxiety, depression, and long-term stress that affect both mind and body. Simple habits like regular exercise, proper sleep, mindfulness, and seeking professional help when needed can make a big difference.

mentalhealth,1mv8rz4,Feels like my mental health is worsening.,"So, figure here is better than nothing to try venting about the horrendous things on my mind. I want to specify its TW: Self Esteem/Anxiety/Depression/Eating Disorder/Dysmorphia.

I havent been around long, only 23 years and yet some days I feel like ive been fucked over by how I grew up and spent so many years of my life. As a kid, I shut myself in and refused to interact with people. As a teenager I got addicted to my computer and had mental breakdowns every time it was forcibly taken away because I couldnt handle of. And as a young adult.. I was shut in my home for years without a job, social life, anything. Sure ive been out more often recently thanks to therapy, but the depression gets to me a lot, and meeting new people always fills me with so much anxiety, let alone my friends whom I constantly worry will leave me, or that I'll say something wrong. Its debilitating how I'll notice something that makes me feel anxious about my friends and be unable to move or speak for hours and hours.

And now? Well life enjoys throwing curveballs at me. Finally started feeling happier, medication, im losing weight, and then it all flooded in and I feel sometimes far far worse than I did before. Now there's some days I have trouble getting out of bed, and find my appearance in the mirror repulsive, hideous, disgusting. I might not have an eating disorder yet but its like I can feel it developing and I dont know how to even stop it. I see it, I know its there and I know what will happen, but its like I cant stop. My desire to lose weight is so strong I feel extreme cognitive dissonance. Some days I starve. Other days I have less than 1000 calories and lay awake at night hungry. I feel horrible eating anything with too many carbs, and juice feels like im drinking something that will make me fat again. I can see why im wrong but fuck why cant I stop?? People are worried about me, im worried about me but i feel like sometimes im talking to another person when i try and convince myself to do something healthier. I havent started purging.

I’m unsure if this is the correct place. I have been having some severe issues since moving back in with my parents house. I won’t describe them but professionals have said I should move out as soon as possible. 

I get so exhausted from the issues at home that I turn up to work (WFH - 2 days in office) and really focus on my work but no one else. My team like talking to each other, but I find it difficult to even come up with anything to say so I stay quiet. I have had a few members of the team mention this indirectly, which makes me feel terrible. It doesn’t feel like anxiety, it’s just that my mouth will not physically open to say anything. 

Things I have tried:
- new hobbies
- therapy every two weeks
- making new friends
- trying to move out (I’m not on a permanent contract so estate agents won’t accept me with the current financial and housing climate)

I want to ask if anyone has any other advice I may not have thought of? I have successfully found new hobbies and friends but they don’t take me out of this headspace and I can’t spend time on either of them for that long.

mentalhealth,1n02y1o,In need of advice: My boyfriend and I are on a break after my mental health got out of whack due to a series of personal events occuring,"Note: I had to completely rewrite this and use an editor to help make it less messy

  
I (21F) have been struggling lately in my relationship with my boyfriend (21M). We’ve been together 8 months, but the last month and a half hit me hard:

* My grandfather passed away.
* I lost my internship after being harassed.
* My mom threatened to kick me out when I lost income, then got sick with diabetes complications.
* I learned I can’t return to college for my final semester due to money.

Since these events, I have been spending more time alone since there's nothing for me to really go out and do. Which has resulted in loneliness and clinginess.

These things triggered a downturn in my mental health. I became clingy, anxious, and reactive having “tizzies” where I’d overthink, panic, and crave reassurance. I’d get irritated or upset over small things, which is not usually like me. It may come from past relationship wounds or childhood experiences.

He usually goes away for military training every other month for just one weekend. And a pattern we started to notice was that I would get overwhelmed because of lack of attention when he was off duty. Most times him and his friend were out doing things they wanted to do. But this last time it got bad, and I don't really know what happened to me. I don't mean to get that way, in fact I am all for him spending time with his friends. 

One night with friends, I thought my boyfriend seemed upset, so I left without telling anyone to calm down. He was hurt, but when we talked I fully apologized. Because I took accountability and realized what I did was stupid and unlike me. He admitted he wasn’t too happy from everything going on but didn’t want to end things. He told me I’m his ideal type but struggle with independence.

We saw each other a few times after and things seemed okay—he still texted me good morning, goodnight, “I love you,” and checked in. But when we had a longer talk last night, he explained something that really hit me: my recent overreactions reminded him of his ex, who made him feel like nothing he did was good enough. He said he knows I’m not her, but those feelings resurfaced and weighed on him. Hearing that broke my heart because I never meant to stress him and seem to unintentionally take it out on him; I was just overwhelmed by everything else. 

Ultimately, we agreed to take a break. We didn't want to break up, just wanted to resolve things. As well as work on ourselves. Neither of us is angry—we still love each other, he says he sees a future and wants to marry me someday—but we’re both stressed and not in the right place. We're working on being better people for ourselves and for each other. He cried during the call, which hurt to hear. I was crying too. We agreed to check in after two weeks, once his busy schedule settles, and see where we stand.

**My questions:**

1. How can I stop overreacting when outside stress hits?
2. How can I manage depression/anxiety so I can be a stronger, more independent partner?
3. How can I support him better, especially knowing his history?
4. How should I distract myself when he's away for things like military training?
5. What can we do as a couple to help our mental health as individuals?

mentalhealth,1mys0uj,How to prepare for bad mental health,"Hey! I do this funny thing where my mental health is always so much worse whenever I'm at school, my brain just can't be dealing with the stress of it apparently lol. I'm going into my second year of uni now and last yr was particularly bad. I don't have any up to date diagnoses but I struggle with symptoms of anxiety and depression. I'd say my biggest problems are in completing normal tasks so like showering every day, keeping my hair washed, eating properly, keeping in contact with any of my friends etc. So my question is, is there anything you guys have done or can think of to help prepare for a time when you know you'll be doing worse?

For example, I've now perfected 3 meals i can eat so that I only have to cook for like 15mins 3 times a week and the other days the stuff is ready in the fridge. My idea is that I can be strategic about which days I think I'll be up for cooking and having to do it less often might allow me to cook more. When I'm bad I'm still able to eat but often not convince myself to prepare food so it'll only be whatevers sitting on my shelf, which isn't bad (eating anything is still good!) but eating an actual meal does make me feel better, and I'm trying to take my diet more seriously cuz of a gi thing I have lol.

So are there any more examples of habits or things you can try and work out while your symptoms are more manageable to help when you know they're gonna be worse :))",1,0,hey i do this funny thing where my mental health is always so much worse whenever i'm at school my brain just can't be dealing with the stress of it apparently lol i'm going into my second year of uni now and last yr was particularly bad i don't have any up to date diagnoses but i struggle with symptoms of anxiety and depression i'd say my biggest problems are in completing normal tasks so like showering every day keeping my hair washed eating properly keeping in contact with any of my friends etc so my question is is there anything you guys have done or can think of to help prepare for a time when you know you'll be doing worse for example i've now perfected meals i can eat so that i only have to cook for like mins times a week and the other days the stuff is ready in the fridge my idea is that i can be strategic about which days i think i'll be up for cooking and having to do it less often might allow me to cook more when i'm bad i'm still able to eat but often not convince myself to prepare food so it'll only be whatevers sitting on my shelf which isn't bad eating anything is still good but eating an actual meal does make me feel better and i'm trying to take my diet more seriously cuz of a gi thing i have lol so are there any more examples of habits or things you can try and work out while your symptoms are more manageable to help when you know they're gonna be worse,0.06696428571428573,0.3646,NEGATIVE,0.9928510189056396,positive,positive,negative
mentalhealth,1mrcna1,"🧠 Recovering from nervous system dysregulation & anxiety — building a mental health app, would love your advice/input","Hi everyone,
I’m a software developer who used to work 10–12 hours a day until I burned out — panic attacks, SNS dysregulation, and intense anxiety hit me hard. I had to take months to recover, and I’m now on month 7 of my SSRI treatment.

I decided to channel everything I went through into something positive, so I’m building an app to help people like me and anyone dealing with mental health challenges manage and improve their lives. After trying several apps and not finding one I connected with, I thought: why not build my own?
I’d love to hear your thoughts:

- What features would be most useful for you?
- What have you tried before that worked or didn’t work for you?

Also, if you’re interested, I’m happy to share my recovery journey — what I went through, what helped, and what’s changed since I started medication. This might be especially helpful if you’re starting SSRIs and feeling nervous (I definitely was, and had a ton of questions).

I genuinely want to build something useful for myself and my girl (who struggles with depression) and share it with others too of course, something we all would enjoy using and something that would help us manage our struggles better.

mentalhealth,1mvptuw,Poor mental health taking over my dream,"Hello all 👋

I am 19 years old and have been struggling with mental health at least have been aware of it for 3 years now. I have struggled with depression and social anxiety as well some adhd throughout this time. I have received therapy and still am currently, I have received medications, and I have tried lots of cognitive behavioral therapy to try and overcome this mental stronghold. I quite honestly don’t know if I need a new therapist or if I’m all out of luck for trying to overcome and work on my mental health. I am not in college and I graduated HS about a year and a half ago. I however did start out in my dream career about a couple months ago with high hopes to finally take care of myself financially and really develop into my adulthood and live out my dream career. I’ve dreamed to start this career for about 5 years now and nothing changed along the way which led me to begin to go after it now. I always have period where I feel really super highs and super lows, however I just can’t seem to break out of what I’ve learned to call chronic depression. I thought I had beat this once and for all and I thought that with graduating high school and starting my dream job that I’d be fine and would overcome all of it however I still feel the same way and still consistently have my depressive periods. Now that my dream career honeymoon is wearing off, something feels like this may not be the career for me. It’s baffling to even utter this thinking because how can a career/job that I’ve dreamed of for all these years instantly start feeling like something I no longer hold interest towards after such little time. I know I’m only 19, but my entire life I’ve been told that I do thing most ordinary individuals my age aren’t doing, and that my dreams and dedications have already and will continue to take me far in life which makes me think this is more than just I, myself not knowing what I want to for the rest of my life. I can’t seem to find the route problem of what I’ve been struggling with and more so why I continue to struggle with this, so I’m asking if anyone out there who’s educated on this or has experienced and overcome this themselves may have any advice or recommendations. I just want to be myself and be ok and genuinely happy! I struggle with social anxiety which seems to juggle with my depression. I also struggle with my identity and who I am as a person and my personality which I think stems from the extreme insecurity and lack of self love I have which keeps me focused on everyone else’s opinion of myself and I think I conjure up self hate on myself from negative thoughts I bring on myself that I believe other people think about me too. I would love to hear any therapy ideas or anything at all that may help me cure my negative mental health and just really feel like a person and not a mental healthy mess. Thank you!

mentalhealth,1mblmqr,My mum's mental health is getting worse,"Idk if this is the right subreddit to post this, lets try.

I (19F) live together with my single mum. She is unemployed, I work fulltime to support us. She suffers from depression and anxiety since about 25 years, she was always on medication and used to go to therapy until about 10 years ago. In the past two years, her overall mental condition has worsened. She completely changed, she doesn't go out of the house or meet with friends anymore, she is quiet, she rarely talks to anyone except me, she refuses to take medication and overall is obviously depressed. 

About three months ago, her psychological symptoms became psychosomatic. She was feeling sick all the time, had high blood pressure, stopped eating, wasn't able to take any pills and ended up in hospital 7 times in the last couple of weeks. She got so weak that she is only able to move around in a wheelchair, she needs help showering and going to the toilet. Every time she gets out of the hospital she was feeling better for a couple of days before everything went back to 'normal'. We never got any specific diagnosis from doctors except a referral to a psychologial rehabilitation clinic, we are currently waiting for them to admit her (which can take weeks according to the doctors). 

In the meantime, we both suffer from her mental problems. I try everything to make her feel okay and loved. I cook her whatever she wants to eat (if she wants to eat).

mentalhealth,1mr6ach,"Mental Health, Anger, and Coping.","My mom and I have a complicated relationship. When I was a kid, she often used me as an outlet for her anger and would threaten to leave if I misbehaved. I understand now that she acted that way because my dad was physically abusive towards her. In my childhood, he was physically abusive towards me too. As time passed, I developed severe anxiety, depression, and ptsd as a result, all of which are diagnosed. I also have suicidal ideations.

I am trying to repair my relationship with her now because I can see that she is truly trying her best to make amends and be a support for me while I navigate my mental health. The kicker is, whenever I feel triggered by something she did that seems to resemble something she did in the past, I will respond with anger and, blame. She on the otherhand will not say anything and take it. I become so overwhelmed with memories of the hurt I experienced that I feel like i need to protect myself with the anger by raising my voice. However, I truly do recognize that this is both extremely unhelpful and hurtful. I do not codone raising anyone raising their voice at someone. I want to change but I am having trouble with it.

Recently, we had a huge fight which escalated to the point I pushed her shoulder and grabbed her shirt. I also intentionally said mean things in order to provoke her to communicate with me because I was so confused by the fact she  will not say anything. I tried to hurt myself too because I felt so overwhlemed and it felt like the only outlet for me. After calming down, I realized the harm that is done and I can't stop thinking about what a terrible person I am for treating my mom that way. I am 100% guilty and at fault. I will never treat someone that way again. I want to commit to this by creating a plan of action that helps my prevent an angry outburt or manage my anger when I feel it. I have seen people post about medications, exercise, and stepping away from the situation as forms of coping. I found that it's really difficult for me to do any of these when I feel angry. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Or do you have a step by step plan for meditation or exercise that would help me understand the coping mechanisms better? Thank you.

mentalhealth,1mrjuyj,Friendship break over unaddressed poor mental health?,"I told my (best?) friend I haven’t wanted to visit her lately because of how repressed and small I feel when I’m with her and now we’re not talking. How to move forward?

In college, we were inseparable. We’d always vent to each other and felt comfortable in each other’s presence. But I always had this creeping sense of wrongness and anxiety. I obsessed over what she really thought of me. I felt dead inside and lonely even when we were laughing and happy. For context, we both have mental health issues and I met her just a month or two after trying to off myself. I never really dealt with that despite repeated failed attempts to get therapy. We often spoke about intimate details of our struggles, and I thought this would help me feel better, but I dissociated while talking, and as time went on, I felt more resentful that I would leave our deep talks feeling so lonely.

Now, I’m stuck at home for now with my abusive mother and she’s about an hour away, and we’ve discussed seeing each other but I just haven’t been able to bring myself to because I’m in survival mode and I don’t think I can stand feeling so alone and repressed while with someone who’s supposed to know me better than anyone else. One day I sent her a text out of the blue saying this and a bunch of over things (wondering why she seemed okay with watching me keep making the decision to return to my abusive mother, wondering why she seemed okay with watching as I gave up on my college dreams due to untreated depression, feeling like I was too attached to her) and now she’s hurt, said she doesn’t deserve to feel like she’s not enough for me, and needs distance.

mentalhealth,1lxkfuy,"Friendship issues, isolation, and mental health","Vent post but want opinions/thoughts since I’m comfortable in whatever direction I’m heading for the time being.

I’ve decided to pull back from friendships that were too one sided. No blocking or words exchanged. Just stopped letting it be one way. Not a situation of me overestimating my value in these people’s lives. I’ve known one for my entire life, the other two years. 

The long time friend hasn’t reached out to me at all other than to handle logistics for our group. I’ve avoided every weekly outing or get-together. They never once commented on it or spoke of either of our lives. The other friend only reached out once, and did check in, curious if I was well. Said they missed me. I didn’t engage with it much and just said I was great. I didn’t think much of it because this person made me feel abandoned and ghosted me the past several months for weeks at a time without responding, and months at certain points in which they only contacted me when they wanted to, ignoring any message I'd sent prior.

I don’t know if these people are real friends to me. Scary to say because one's been in my life forever. I know they really value me in their lives. I'd nearly made an exit from them before and they were quite upset and hurt by it. Repaired and came back. When times were good with both, I felt loved and cared about. But I’ve had to carry these friendships through everything. All my friends know my door is always open. I’ve had to play therapist. Solve their problems. Support them through their worst. I was the first person both went to. But in my times of need they couldn’t make time. After I helped them, they’d forget about me, and I’d have weeks alone. They’d never reach out. Gave me the bare minimum and replied to my texts with almost nothing.

It's been a weird time. I gave time back to myself. Started going to the gym 3x a week. Doing things I’ve wanted to be doing but put off because of my friends. Though I don't entirely regret it and love the time spent. I tried making new friends around my city. No luck. Especially since I’m working more, and I do 2nd+3rd shift. So it’s near impossible to meet people. Tried online. I game a lot—met people there. Mixed results. Met a lot of weird and incredibly clingy people. Tried other places like subreddits and other places. Mostly the same.

I have a new problem now. Even people that weren’t problematic, I’ve had to cut off. Say I have other focuses, so it’d be best to part. Everyone I talk to now, especially new people, I get disappointed by. I lose all desire to talk to them, or anyone, for the rest of the day and isolate. I get stressed or sick. I can handle light texting, no more. The few new people I have, 1–2 of them text me any time they see me online even after I say no or that I want to be alone, and it gets me so sick I have to stop playing my game so I don’t get watched or harassed.

So I started isolating. It’s been great for me bettering myself. But I’m lonely, and want friends or interaction. But every time I try I get tired or even disgusted of people, and give up—left with loneliness and that feeling. My depression, which wasn’t a big problem and was absent the past few months, surged back. Still manageable. My anxiety, which used to threaten me daily, is now largely absent.

Has anyone gone through anything similar? I’d like to get out of this rut and get back to normal again if anyone has advice.

mentalhealth,1mgn1ta,"Long-distance situationship, 9 years in — her mental health turned things upside down. Need advice on how to handle this.","Hi therapists & kind strangers,
I’m not asking for formal clinical diagnosis — just genuine insight from those familiar with mental health dynamics.

So here’s the story:

Me (30M) and my partner (29F) have been together for 9 years. It was a deep, long, loyal relationship with some breaks in between. A year ago, she moved to work in Dubai. At first, she was very persistent about me visiting her, almost begging. But due to personal reasons, I didn’t go. That started a long-distance tension that led to a breakup in January this year. We didn’t speak for nearly 6 months.

Out of nowhere, she texted me again on my birthday, saying she missed me and that she had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Since then, things became confusing. She would open up one moment and completely shut down the next. She’d say stuff like “I can’t love you if I don’t love myself,” “I’m emotionally drained,” “I need time,” but also things like “I need you next to me,” “you’re the only one who gives me peace,” “come live with me in Dubai,” and “you’re the only one I trust.”

Even when she visited our hometown recently, she insisted on seeing only me. We kissed, she broke down emotionally in my arms, cried heavily, opened up… and the next day? Cold, distant, avoiding, no replies. When she went back to Dubai, she was back to closing off emotionally, blocking my calls, hiding location, not replying — all while saying she still wants me in her life and wants to “take it slow.”

It’s becoming draining. It’s like she wants the intimacy and safety, but also pushes me away. I’m not asking her to commit fully or give 100% — I just want clarity and basic respect. I’m doing my best to stay chill and masculine, but it’s hard to know how to balance care with self-respect when she’s so emotionally unpredictable.

TL;DR:
Been in a 9-year relationship. She moved to Dubai last year, we broke up for 6 months, reconnected last month. She says she’s depressed and anxious. She swings between affection and distance. In person she’s all love and emotion. Over distance, she withdraws and ghosts. Says she wants me but keeps pushing me away. I’m trying to stay cool and not needy, but this is getting confusing and draining. Just want real insight on how to deal with someone going through this kind of emotional/mental state.",2,1,hi therapists kind strangers i m not asking for formal clinical diagnosis just genuine insight from those familiar with mental health dynamics so here s the story me m and my partner f have been together for years it was a deep long loyal relationship with some breaks in between a year ago she moved to work in dubai at first she was very persistent about me visiting her almost begging but due to personal reasons i didn t go that started a long distance tension that led to a breakup in january this year we didn t speak for nearly months out of nowhere she texted me again on my birthday saying she missed me and that she had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since then things became confusing she would open up one moment and completely shut down the next she d say stuff like i can t love you if i don t love myself i m emotionally drained i need time but also things like i need you next to me you re the only one who gives me peace come live with me in dubai and you re the only one i trust even when she visited our hometown recently she insisted on seeing only me we kissed she broke down emotionally in my arms cried heavily opened up and the next day cold distant avoiding no replies when she went back to dubai she was back to closing off emotionally blocking my calls hiding location not replying all while saying she still wants me in her life and wants to take it slow it s becoming draining it s like she wants the intimacy and safety but also pushes me away i m not asking her to commit fully or give i just want clarity and basic respect i m doing my best to stay chill and masculine but it s hard to know how to balance care with self respect when she s so emotionally unpredictable tl dr been in a year relationship she moved to dubai last year we broke up for months reconnected last month she says she s depressed and anxious she swings between affection and distance in person she s all love and emotion over distance she withdraws and ghosts says she wants me but keeps pushing me away i m trying to stay cool and not needy but this is getting confusing and draining just want real insight on how to deal with someone going through this kind of emotional mental state,0.07456583377636011,0.9927,NEGATIVE,0.9846296906471252,positive,positive,negative

mentalhealth,1mmk4qa,Mental Health Destroyed by BF,"I’ve been living with my partner for almost 3 years. I had no choice due to bad health and no job. He makes 6 figures, I now make a tick above minimum wage in the Chicago suburbs. We’re both in our mid 50s. He has 50/50 custody of his 2 boys (18 & 12). He hates his ex wife and how she’s all over the place. She’s the type that everyone has to do what she wants no matter your opinion, hence the reason why my partner hates her. 

Anyway, my partner struggles with severe mental illness, depression, negative self worth, anger, severe anxiety and suicidal ideation. It’s BAD! Any little thing will trigger him, even my fried egg sandwich breakfast set him off last weekend. I struggle with anxiety and mild depression, which I have therapy for. My partner sometimes talks to his therapist and takes medication to help stable his mood (it doesn’t work). 

Every week he has tantrums and flips out, screaming, yelling, slamming, throwing, etc. Screaming how everyone hates him & how he’s better off dead. He goes on & on about how he doesn’t want to live, no one cares or likes him, etc, all negative thoughts spoken/screamed. While I sit there being dumped on. I TRY to reassure him and things just get worse. No amount of trying to talk him down works, it just gets worse to the point where I have to get up and leave before I start to cry. Oh, if I cry, I get screamed at for making him feel worse and judged. So, I walk away. This occurs weekly. There is ZERO happiness in this home, ZERO. Even good news gets squashed cause he believes he doesn’t deserve it or anything good. 

I keep quiet of my problems cause it’ll trigger him. I suffer in silence all the time. It eats away at me. I cry everyday damn day and I can’t take it anymore. 

Yesterday after another day of his suicidal ideation & anger, I walked out and locked myself in the bedroom. He was so upset and all I could do is listen to his outbursts. I have so much going on in my own life (bad health, chronic pain, job hunting) that I smoked a lot of weed. It hurts my heart to see other people happy and I’m here miserable and stuck.

Im stuck here because I do not have a good paying job, it’s part time, no health insurance (he currently pays mine), and I have no family to turn to.

mentalhealth,1mflgaf,Looking for advice on how to help my partner understand my mental health struggles,"My partner and I are in our twenties and have been together for about 8 months now. Things are going really well overall, but I want some advice on how I can help explain my mental health to him/something to help him better be able to support me.

I have struggled with major depressive disorder and anxiety for the past 8 years or so; and have been pretty stable for the past few years though going through a bit of a hard time due to job, financial instability, living situation etc etc. I have been on medication and it’s working well. My partner knows my struggles, and I have been pretty open with him on how hard it’s been for me in the past and how I need his support. I do my best to explain what it’s like living with depression, but feel I could do better? And it’s hard in the moment to explain what I’m feeling. I know he loves me immensely. But I also know he struggles to understand how I can be affected in my day to day life. He is quite busy and works a lot and therefore hasn’t been able to be around me for long periods of time where he can notice when my mental health falters. His way of comforting me is often phrases like “it’s ok everyone has bad days” “it’s just how life is” etc. he has good points of course but it gets kind of annoying and sometimes dismissive though not his intent.

So yeah. I was wondering if there are any resources out there that could help better understand me and better support me. I tried my local library but honestly struck out. Articles I’ve found online are very surface level but I could definitely search more. I know this is an in depth question but thought I could get some advice from different people here which would be helpful. Additionally, couples therapy is definitely something I’d like to pursue in the future when it’s more financially feasible we do have long term goals together.

mentalhealth,1mcqj35,Advice needed about mental health,"Hi, I am on an anonymous account as I don’t want to publish anything that can be linked to myself. I am 18 years old and since around late december 2024 I have found that my mental health has been decreasing. I spoke to the doctor about this and they diagnosed me with mixed anxiety and depression disorder around 1 month ago. 

Anxiety was not a surprise to me as I have already been diagnosed with anxiety for 3 years however the depression was strangely validating as since December 2024 I had felt as though I was though didn’t want to bring attention to it as I was scared i was over reacting. The only person i spoke to about the depression was my boyfriend who supported me loads and i am so grateful for him, he has and is helping me a lot through this time. 

I am on anti-depressants and have felt a boost in my mood (yay) but I am now struggling with my mental state and i am confused. 

I am living a very fortunate life in terms of things i receive and I am attending Uni, have my own car and business, boyfriend and a roof over my head, so I also feel very stupid for feeling so low. I know i need to start seeing a therapist again but right now i need some help with how ive been feeling, a lot of the time however it has stopped being so frequent, I question if life is really real, if what I am doing is normal and if im on the right track, I also struggle with opening up to people other than my boyfriend. 

My mum is under a lot of stress and I am the person she off loads on ( main reason i have mental health issues) I have mood swings and I also get tired super easily, I just want to start feeling normal again and be able to live my life with out questioning if i am going to be okay today. 

I have bad anxiety about doing normal tasks such as taking the dog on a walk, going to get food in my car, and such things as I am a huge people pleaser - like bad, today i started crying because I couldn’t take my boyfriend and sister to macdonalds cause I wanted to go home…neither of them were that bothered but we went anyway because I felt so bad for crying it’s like a curse. I hate it.

mentalhealth,1m5d4oy,My mental health has taken a bad dive.,"At the beginning of this year things were starting to turn around. I finally had made friends, I had a good boyfriend, I had a good work life and school was stressful but not bad.

And then May happened. 

Out of my own selfishness I did something horrible that I will regret doing for the rest of my life. 

As a result, I lost all the friendships I had made and my relationship shattered and I hurt someone deeply in which I love more than life. My work life started becoming terrible, as my boss started talking shit about me to my coworkers. My schooling became extremely stressful with summer classes. It all crumbled around me and I had no one else to blame but myself. 

Ever since I had struggled with sh and suicidal thoughts. I went into a deep depression, but depression doesn’t help anything. It doesn’t help me fix what I broke so I tried to get better.

But then the crippling anxiety came through. Nearly everyday, I have panic attacks. Everything from life to health anxiety, I’m terrified constantly. I have had to get on short term meds while I wait for long term meds like SSRIs. The short term meds are just there to help me get through the day, I’ve had to take off work because I couldn’t function due to staying up all night having continuous attacks. 

It’s just hard and I hate comfort because I don’t deserve comfort. I feel like I can’t pick myself up, like I’m literally falling apart. 

I have to take anxiety pills just to SLEEP. I know I don’t deserve any comfort or pity or sympathy whatever, I don’t want or need any of that, I just want to function. 

I just don’t want to die yet. I obsess over it. I think of all the ways I could die. For instance if I see a bug bite I think of all the bugs that could’ve bitten me. A mosquito? A bot fly with worm larvae? A tick that would give me lime disease? Is my lymph node swollen? It’s swollen, do I have an infection, am I sick? Is it a cold or bacterial meningitis? Do I have cancer?

Or something else like why does my vein look like that? Do I have a blood clot? Deep vein thrombosis? Is my leg swelling? Is it feverish? What if the clot passes into my blood stream and carries itself away to my heart? My lungs? My brain? Am I going to have a stroke? Will I die? If I don’t die will I end up disabled? Or brain dead?

Or my family, what if they’re in an accident? What if they die on the highway, what if someone hits them? How will I find them? My boyfriend? What if he gets robbed and shot? What if he gets into an accident? What if I never see him or my family ever again? What if I don’t get to say goodbye what if they are alone and die alone?

What if I never get better? What if I am in a constant state of panic and no one ever takes me seriously and I end up being the joke or the crazy family member everyone talks shit about? What if I die alone? What if I cry wolf so many times that when I am actually dying everyone just thinks it’s anxiety?

It’s just never fucking ending. I don’t know what to do. My suicidal ideations have turned into a fear of death I can’t escape. I’m going to the doctor and am starting therapy soon, but I just don’t know how I let it get this bad. And it stemmed from me fucking up so bad. I know I feel bad but shit I can’t imagine how my partner feels, he says he’s fine but I can’t know that he isn’t lying to me. 

How can I live and fix everything with my boyfriend and life if everyday I think I’m going to die?

mentalhealth,1mc0n7o,"My family says my mental health isn’t real. I’m overwhelmed, confused, and trying to hold on.","I’m 19F and trying to figure out how to stay grounded and survive in a really toxic environment. I’ve been struggling a lot lately, depression, anxiety, feeling numb, exhausted, and like I’ve lost all the passion I used to have. I wake up feeling heavy every day. Nothing feels like it used to.

I tried to express that recently by posting something online, just being honest about how I feel, and my family saw it and freaked out. They said I was being dramatic and trying to make them look bad. One of my relatives even physically pulled my hair during an argument, and my mom said my mental health is “all in my head” and “not real.”

I’ve never felt so small. She said I’m a fraud for calling myself religious if I don’t want to go to church every week. She told me my actions don’t match my words and that I’m just doing all of this for attention. She also refused to support me when I got baptized, because she had chosen a different religion and felt hurt by my choice.

All of this has made me question everything. I know I’m not okay, but when people keep telling you that your feelings aren’t real, it gets hard to believe yourself.

I’m trying to stay grounded in my relationship with God. I’m trying to survive school, to love someone who makes me feel safe, to grow. But I feel completely alone in it all. Like I’m carrying the weight of the world and being told it’s just my imagination.

mentalhealth,1ljlrk6,Does most mental health advice just … not work for anyone else?,"I’ve been dealing with mental health issues since I was a kid, and lately, things have felt especially rough. My anxiety and depression have been flaring up badly, and over the past couple of years, I’ve had several panic attacks - three of which landed me in the hospital. The most recent one was just this morning. I had a panic attack at 9:30 am yesterday, and while I calmed down after a few minutes, my body never returned to “normal.” I spent the whole day with muscle tightness and chest pain that was really uncomfortable. I couldn’t sleep, and at 1:30 am I went to the ER.

Even a full day later, I’m still feeling the aftermath - what I’ve seen called a “panic attack hangover” - with tension lingering in my chest and upper body.

Every time this happens, I try to reflect and figure out what I should be doing differently. I stay open to advice. But honestly? I’ve become really cynical about most of it.

I’ve tried so much: CBT and DBT, regular therapy, psychiatric meds, ketamine treatment, yoga, exercise, meditation, breathing exercises, changing my diet (even stopped being vegan to see if it helped), better sleep habits … the list goes on. And while some of these things have helped a bit, I always seem to end up right back here: in a hospital bed, feeling dumb, hopeless, and broken.

And when I’m in the middle of a full-blown panic attack? The only thing that actually works is a benzodiazepine. Yesterday, I tried everything I could think of to calm down - magnesium, ashwagandha, a supplement with magnesium, L-theanine, and chamomile, Benadryl, ibuprofen, breathing exercises, holding an ice pack, even walking around the neighborhood. None of it helped. Not even a little. The only thing that finally brought me relief was Ativan at the hospital. Nothing else even came close.

The ER doctor did prescribe me some Ativan, but I already have an existing prescription for Xanax - just 15 pills at a time - and I’ve already used them up. I can’t refill it until next week. Honestly, I think that if I had a small supply of benzos at home, I could prevent these crises from escalating. But at the same time, I feel so ashamed about relying on them.

About a year ago, I started using kratom. I know it’s not a great coping strategy - and I’ve quit and restarted a few times - but when I feel horrible and like nothing else works, it’s hard not to reach for something that feels like relief. That said, I think it may have contributed to my panic attack this time.

mentalhealth,1m07bg3,Question about mental health,"
I’m a Grade 11 student going into Grade 12. Over the years, I’ve been slowly declining mentally and emotionally. I grew up in a toxic, abusive home where there was constant fighting, neglect, and no real support from my parents. I went through a lot of trauma and stress that I couldn’t handle. I started coping in extreme ways — like overexercising, fasting, isolating, abusing caffeine, and eventually breaking down mentally.

By age 13, I became withdrawn, lost friends, and developed depression, anxiety, and later OCD and psychosis-like symptoms. I had delusions, hallucinations, panic attacks, and a total mental collapse. I couldn't focus, think, or function in school, and ended up cheating and forging my way through some grades. I was eventually expelled and everything just kept spiraling.

I had two hospitalizations, was diagnosed with GAD and then bipolar disorder, and was put on meds, but I didn’t stick with them. The system didn’t feel like it understood me. My symptoms got worse, and I ended up isolating myself, lying in bed for months, and obsessively trying to “fix” myself with hot water therapy — soaking in very hot baths to relieve stress, which actually helped me feel temporarily normal. I made it very hot where It was burning dangerous low blood pressure fainting but that felt good to me.

Now I’m stuck. My parents don’t care, I don’t trust medications, and I’m afraid they’ll hurt my brain more. But I know I need real help. I feel like stress is the root of everything — and when it lifts, I feel clear again. I just want someone to understand the full picture and tell me whether to get help or to continue trying to get better naturally.

At some point I was fully mentally retarded I couldn't think I still can't. I couldn't eat or drink I didn't care. I didn't care about my life thr world my dreams or anything everything was gone. Is stared at physical objects.  Sometimes I do with the help of the hot water or especially drugs like caffeine. My whole mind has been eaten away.

mentalhealth,1m34udr,How to accept to take care of your mental health?,"TLDR: I'm pretty sure that I'm going through a burnout, but despite that I can't really manage to take care of myself and rest, as I still feel like I should be more productive.

For context, I've never exactly been the happiest person and have struggled with depression and anxiety in the past. During my first two years of studies, I was in a really intense math program (I don't like math, just did it to please parents) and was constantly stressed out. Ever since then, I felt some emotional numbness: I don't really feel happiness or sadness or stress anymore. I could still feel some reduced emotion throughout my master's, and that's how I managed to continue my studies as I was relying on this stress rather than motivation to finish my work.  
I am now in my second year of my phd, and I'm paid (nicely) and have little constraints, so I should be grateful for this. However, since the very beginning, I haven't been able to focus much. I do have strong ADHD symptoms which may not have been helped by the fact that I haven't taken many breaks (did a second masters immediately after my first one, moved and started another phd program that wasn't for me, moved again and switched to this PhD with no days off in between). My supervisor is a very efficient person, the type of person that hyperfocuses on work even more if life gets hard, the type of person who does a PhD very quickly. For me, especially since I don't really feel the stress as I used to before, it gets really hard to be productive and to catch up the fact that I was not productive, I work late in the evenings, and because I only start to get productive and random times like 1 am, I can get to sleep at 5 am, while still setting my alarm at 8:30am. Because I'm exhausted, the cycle repeats itself and I never really fully rest. Because my supervisor is very efficient and expects similar efficiency, even on days where I do manage to get enough work done, it's enough work in my eyes but not in my supervisor's eyes, so I feel that I have to catch up again.  
On top of that, I lost a parent three months ago. I took two weeks off at the time, but since then I've had even more difficulties sleeping and never really feel rested. I've actually started seeing shadows in my eyes, which I read may be a sign of sleep deprivation.

I'm fully aware that the best idea here would to clearly take a break, get away from the screen when I feel unproductive instead of staring at it for hours, go see friends and exercise, see a therapist. Yet, all I can think of is ""well just get this done and then you won't be behind and then everything will solve itself"", and cannot get myself to just take breaks. Despite being in academia which is quite flexible, if I am not in front of my computer during regular work hours, I feel bad (and that's fully a self-set pressure, it's not like anyone's checking or anything). I have to publish soon, which adds to it. I feel like spending time on anything I do, I should really spend it working instead. I do still take a breather when eating or on some weekends or seeing friends, but I always have in mind that I should finish work after/instead. This need to catch up with the work I need to do overtakes everything even when I know deep down that it isn't realistic, that I can't just get it done in two hours and then feel like I caught up on everything.

Because in truth, I am perfectly fine as long as I have a normal day. When something unsettling happens, say I forgot my wallet when leaving home, or dropped food on the floor, I get irrationally angry and frustrated with myself, which leads me to have depressing thoughts as a result, mostly feeling like I want to cry, scream or hit myself, though I don't usually do any of those things unless I'm alone. 

Normally, these symptoms can last from 10/15 minutes for very minor stuff like what I just mentioned, to half a day when it's something a little more serious (say a mistake I had during work). My body doesn't react at all to these events, that is, I don't feel like I can't breathe or anything like that.

My therapist thinks I could have a depressing/anxious personality, but I don't know if that happens to fit my troubles.

mentalhealth,1lpyyf0,Do you guys believe covid had a huge impact on society's mental health?,"By the way I'm not talking abt just some people feeling worse, but a shift in society. I saw a post on pinterest actually where someone talked about how the world feels less alive, less exciting and less magical after covid. They said society feels more depressed and numb.

I have seen many people express such sentiments, but honestly, I think a huge part of it is that many people just grew up and are living adult life now. Many people who were teenagers during covid are now having to navigate being an adult. And I think some people might just be a bit more aware of society and what is going on. The world has always been shit and weird. There have always been people suffering and wars, economical issues, financial issues etc. and maybe covid has shaken some people awake, so that they now are just more aware of the world and therefore feel like it seems more depressing? Maybe this is just because I have been feeling depressed for years and luckily didn't suffer too much during the pandemic (I was lucky enough to not have lost someone). Life wasn't really enjoyable for me before covid, so I might not have noticed that huge shift.  I know that a lot of people just felt so bad during lockdown, and as an introvert with severe social anxiety it was actually relieving (I'm still well aware that people have died and we shouldn't paint the pandemic as a good thing).

It is just that I feel like many people blame covid for everything that is not going well in the world or their personal lives and while in some cases I partially agree, I sometimes find myself thinking ""maybe that is just life"".

mentalhealth,1lvn98o,:Adult Living at Home: Parents Controlling Phone Access Despite Mental Health Needs,"""Hi everyone,

I'm an adult living at home, navigating some really challenging family dynamics and struggling with my mental health (depression, anxiety, history of suicidal thoughts). I'm actively working with a therapist and just started with a case manager, which is helping a lot.

A big issue I'm facing is not having a personal phone. I've realized it's crucial for my safety to be able to call a warm line or crisis line when I'm under extreme stress, specifically to help manage suicidal thoughts. I've tried to explain this to my parents, framing it as a vital tool for my mental health and safety, not just a want.

However, my parents are very controlling. They've previously read my private emails (including ones to my therapist), and they don't like it when I don't show the 'right' emotional reaction to things. My dad also frequently nitpicks my work and appearance, using really hurtful language (like calling me 'retarded' or a 'meth addict'), even though I'm an adult and have asked him to stop. This general atmosphere of control and criticism makes it very hard to advocate for myself.

They were even upset when I was late getting home from picking up an extra work shift, despite me being an adult working to support myself.

I have a hidden computer I use for private communications, but it's not practical for making calls in a crisis.

**My questions for the community are:**

1. How can I more effectively communicate to my parents the absolute necessity of having a phone for mental health and safety purposes, given their controlling nature?
2. If they continue to refuse, what are some discreet ways an adult can obtain a very basic, cheap phone and plan for emergency use without raising suspicion or compromising my safety if it's discovered? (I don't have a lot of disposable income and cash might be the only way to purchase.)
3. Has anyone dealt with parents who invade privacy or expect specific emotional responses, and how did you manage those dynamics while trying to get essential resources?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening.""

mentalhealth,1lg5p07,Job is killing my mental health — what now?,"Hi everyone! 

I’ve been at my job a little over a year and it’s really taking a toll on my mental health. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my psychiatrist recently started me on meds. We meet monthly and it’s clear my job is a big part of the problem.

I was just told I’m being put on an “informal” performance improvement plan. I’ve been here before.. I was on a PIP at a previous job I left after 9 months. I’m scared this is becoming a pattern that’ll hurt me long-term. I’m not slacking, I’m just completely burnt out and in a role that doesn’t suit me.

I’m considering taking FMLA/short-term disability for mental health reasons, but I haven’t told my manager yet. I’m worried how it’ll look given the performance issues and I don’t know the best way to approach it.

Questions: Has anyone taken FMLA or leave in this kind of situation? Is it okay to request leave without telling your manager first? Can I job search during FMLA? If I leave after the leave, will it hurt me in future job searches?

mentalhealth,1lacvgw,"[HELP] I’m 22, broke, and suffering from trauma and severe body odor — I’m begging for mental health or dermatology help","Hi everyone, I’m Yang, a 22-year-old Filipina.



I’ve been silently suffering from extreme social anxiety, depression, and trauma for over 10 years because of severe body odor (possibly bromhidrosis or hyperhidrosis). I was bullied so badly that I dropped out of school, stopped going outside, and now I live in complete isolation, too ashamed to even be near people.



I’ve tried everything — sweatox, washes, natural remedies, diet changes — nothing worked. I even developed trauma just from \*thinking\* about my smell, and it makes my anxiety worse in crowded spaces. It’s become a painful cycle. I want to live normally, to study again, to meet people, to heal — but I feel like my body and my mind are fighting me every day.



I know I need both \*\*dermatological treatment\*\* (maybe MiraDry or ETS surgery) and \*\*mental health therapy\*\*… but I am financially unable to afford even a consultation. I’m really desperate now. I don’t want to give up on life — I want to fight.



🙏 That’s why I’m posting this. If there are any:

\- Psychologists / psychiatrists who offer free or sliding-scale sessions

\- Clinics or dermatologists willing to help someone in need

\- People who have recovered from this or know where to go

\- Foundations or charities that support cases like mine



\*\*Please help me.\*\* Even one reply, one recommendation, one message of hope means everything to me right now.



And if you’re someone who can offer help or services, I \*promise\* to promote your work as best I can online. I may be poor, but I believe in giving back when someone saves you.

mentalhealth,1luuhl8,"How can I support my partner with psychosis when I, myself, have severe mental health issues?","I have suffered with severe anxiety and depression for around 20 years. I have tried various SSRIs (currently on 200mg Sertraline), I've seen several counsellors and done CBT and am currently trying Flow tCDS.

I also have ADHD so suffer with executive dysfunction and burn out. As well as fibromyalgia and chronic pain.

To summarise, I am struggling day to day with normal life, kids, work etc.

I've been with my partner almost 2 years and we live together. We started having frequent arguments that seemed to stem from minor things. I found it really confusing and upsetting. He had shared with me some of the difficulties and trauma he faced as a child and I began to recognise how his reactions and communication seemed to be linked or triggered by this.

I asked him for a long time to seek help from counselling to try and figure things out and he refused for a long time.

In March, following another over-escalated argument he locked himself in a room and attempted to take an overdose.

On this occasion I called paramedics and he has since been referred to the mental health team. He has been engaging well with them, trying medication and attending regular appointments and counselling.

Today he has been referred to the psychosis team. He mentioned that it makes sense as there have been times during arguments when he has truly believed I have said or done something where I know I haven't.

He's having a medication review and further counselling. 

My concern is that I'm worried my own mental and physical issues mean I won't be able to properly support him. Especially if he has a severe episode of psychosis. I'm a very emotional and sensitive person. I struggle with criticism and have quite poor self esteem. 

He has supported me a lot over the last 2 years but I am still not ""better"". And now he's unable to provide that support and the roles have somewhat reversed. 

I want to be there for him, but I worry I just cant give him everything he needs right now. 

I have a good support network of friends and family. So I have tried not to burden him with my issues to help him heal and recover. 

Part of me wants to let him go. Let him focus entirely on himself without having to consider me or my needs. As when he is struggling, I do feel neglected. And then feel guilt and shame for being so selfish. 

I honestly love him so much. My children have come to love him as a bonus dad. All I want is to be able to heal together but it feels like such a long road ahead.

We are both so broken I don't know if we are doing more harm than good by staying together.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How do you keep a focus on your relationship with so many other factors tearing it down?

Basically I am posting on behalf of my partner who has been suffering with various long term mental health conditions. 

Anxiety, depression, ocd, ptsd and more recently bpd. 
She has been receiving help through the mental health services on and off for years and tried many different antidepressants. 
Her most recent medication she has been on, for approximately 10years now, is clomipramine. 
She has recently been re-referred back to the mental health services after being misdiagnosed after suffering a haemorrhagic stroke. 
Her mental wellbeing has massively decreased and finds daily life very difficult. Especially after reading that a rare side effect of clomipramine is haemorrhagic strokes!
The psychiatrist has suggested that the clomipramine is likely not suitable and has suggested that she try’s a different medication as well as therapy of which she is waiting to start. 
Now… one of the medications she has suggested.. and seems to lean towards is lithium. 
I have had a quick search on here and seen some success stories. 
It seems worth trying, But we are hesitant due to her previous haemorrhagic stroke. 

I’m just curious if anyone has any advice or experience similar to kinda help us make a decision whether to try it or not.

mentalhealth,1j725o2,How can I effectively get support for mental health problems on Reddit?,"Hello, I'm an autistic 20 year old with dysthymia and OCD. I struggle with social isolation, poor self-esteem, not feeling connected to others, intense social anxiety, childhood/adolescent trauma (and all the bitterness and cynicism that comes with those things), chronic depression and suicidality, and honestly quite a lot of other problems. I cannot afford therapy, but I'm really struggling to see the value in my own life or find any compelling reasons to continue it in spite of the fact that I have suffered and do suffer for most of it.

So I think I'll have to find the bulk of my support here on Reddit. That being said, I could really use some advice for how to actually make progress this way—tips regarding subjects like:

* **How to format posts that will actually get responses on mental health subreddits** (not this one specifically)
* **How to keep posts at a reasonable length while providing sufficient context** (many of my problems are really complex and feed into each other, and it would take an *enormous* amount of text to really explain all of it, but obviously people on the internet aren't going to read my entire autobiography)
* **How to differentiate between good advice and bad advice in the comments**
* **What subreddits are actually worth trying** (for example, there's like 5 different depression subreddits and I'm not sure which is the best to use; there are also subreddits like r/selfimprovement and r/getdisciplined, but they seem bent towards increasing productivity; I don't want to be productive, I want to be happy.)
* **How to talk about my feelings with other people in a way that is productive**
* **How to explain my feelings**
* **Any advice or encouragement from people who have walked this same path and have succeeded, if you're really out there**
* **Any advice at all**

I have been in a polyamorous relationship with this girl for about 6 months and while our relationship has been for the most part peaceful and low on drama, we both deal with mental health issues:

* She is bipolar and autistic, prone to panic/anxiety attacks, going nonverbal and rarely, running off with little to no explanation. She is mostly under control though, and actively sees a therapist.
* I struggle with chronic depression, with my symptoms being a bit more intense lately. I tend to freeze up, self-isolate and shut down when under pressure. I'm currently in the process of finding professional help.

I have noticed (and she criticized me for it recently) that I am very under-equipped to deal with her crises when they happen; they always take me by surprise and I tend to take it personally (especially when she runs off to her other partners).

mentalhealth,1kzl771,Desperately looking for a mental health retreat or program,"Hi all,
I’m really struggling right now with severe depression and anxiety. I’m currently in a 12-step program, which has been helpful in some ways, but it’s also brought a lot to the surface and taken a real toll on me mentally and physically. I have insane mood swings and I live in NYC and I just feel like I need to go away. 

I also feel like my body is inflamed, I have really bad acne, I’ve gained weight, and I just don’t feel well on any level—emotionally, mentally, physically, or spiritually. I’m looking for a 21-day (or longer) retreat or program that offers:
-Talk therapy (ideally trauma-informed)
-Somatic therapies like TRE, EMDR, or similar
-Yoga 
-working out 
-Holistic treatments like red light therapy, IV drips, oxygen therapy, hyperbaric chamber, etc.
-A mind-body-soul approach to healing—not just relaxation, but something deeper and transformative

Ideally this could be in the U.S. or abroad—I’m open. If you’ve done something like this or have any suggestions or insight, I’d be so grateful to hear it.

Thank you in advance 💛

mentalhealth,1ld9tvq,Small wins add up to big results. Small wins that helped my mental health.,"I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety disorder since a young age (2 attempts), and I've learned that...

There's never a single magical thing that can change your life, but the results come from a bunch of smaller actions that stack up to slowly turn the needle to the other side.

Just wanted to share some of those things, for anyone who may also be on a journey to improve their mental health.

* **High intensity exercise (moved the needle the most for me)**
   * Make this into a game, try to ""level up"" every week with an extra rep, extra set, or higher weights
* **Getting a 10-minute walk in the sun as SOON as you wake up**
   * Helps with circadian rhythm - gives you a win to start the day
* **Meditation**
   * This one took a long time for the results to kick in - would recommend starting with a guided meditation app (there are a lot of free ones out there)
* **Cleaning up your diet**
   * High protein (keep it simple with 1g for 1lb of body weight), whole foods. Try to avoid high sugar and highly processed foods (you can have a treat every now and then - just keep it under 10% of your total calories).
* **Supplements (keep it simple):**
   * Kalm Mind Hack, Magnesium L Threonate, L Theanine
* **Breathwork / Grounding techniques - for panic / anxiety attacks**
   * Practice these techniques on the good days so they work better on the bad ones.
* **Proper Sleep Hygiene**
   * Sleep at the same time every night. The quality of sleep matters more than the hours slept.
* **Practice gratitude - train your mind to notice the positives in life.**
   * Law of large numbers state that 50% of life is better than average and 50% of life is worse than average. If it feels like there's only ""bad"" in your life, the good is still happening, we're just not noticing it. Write down 3 things you are grateful for every night. Doesn't matter how small (""I got a good parking spot"", ""the weather was nice"", ""dinner tasted really good"", etc.)
* **Get rid of toxic friends**
   * It's going to get lonely for a bit, but it'll be worth it in the end - I promise you.
* **Have a goal**
   * ""What would future me 10 years from now want present me to do?"" Make the answers into actions you can do every day.
* **Educate yourself**
   * Read, listen to podcasts, watch long-form YouTube videos, etc. Don't believe all the information you get, but this really helps you widen your perspective on life.
* **Plan your day in advance**
   * When the next day comes, just work off the list. Don't think twice about ""whether or not you want to do it."" Cross things off as you go down the list.
* **Reduce social media**
   * Doom scrolling literally fries your brain like some hard drugs do. Also makes anxiety kick up when you stop doom scrolling, making it difficult to sleep - and without sleep, it's impossible to improve your mental health.
* **Don't try to fight your anxiety and depression**
   * Think of it like your height. If you don't like your height, you don't live your whole life complaining about it and trying to fight it. You accept it and try to live your best life despite your height. For some of us, our mental health just might be wired to be on the sadder side (who knows why?). Accept that this is what it is (for now, at least), and continue to chase after the small wins. If you stay consistent, one day you'll find that things are a lot better than where it was before.

**Don't go looking for the magical pill.

mentalhealth,1ljz3ca,Beginning My Mental Health Journey - Any Advice?,"Hey all, I'm getting ready to start a mental health journey for myself. I've been needing to find a therapist for a long time now, and I've known this, but after a full breakdown earlier today I decided it's in my best interest to quit putting it off.

I've found a few therapists nearby that I'm going to call and look into before setting up appointments and starting the process. I was wondering if anyone has any advice they would like to give in terms of finding the one that will work best for me, what to look for when it comes to unprofessionalism/lack of qualification, etc. since I haven't been to therapy before.

I would also like to ask for general advice on where to progress from here later on - I'm going to start with therapy alone right now, but in the future (of course as things progress with therapy) I want to see if I can attribute it to possible diagnoses, like ADHD, autism, depressive/anxiety disorders, etc. and go about contacting other professionals for help in that aspect. Of course as my therapist gets to understand how I tick, maybe things will be different and they can suggest ways to progress. But if anyone else can offer some basic advice to keep in consideration as I go through this process, it would be greatly appreciated.

For clarity's sake, I'll mention the issues I'm currently wanting to seek help for are potential depression/anxiety issues, anger/behavioral management, potential underlying causes (such as ADHD or autism, for example), issues with procrastination/organization/focus/routine, and a few other miscellaneous things. I can elaborate in comments if I need to as well, just in case being specific will help with advice.

mentalhealth,1l7merm,My mental health is drastically improving while my best friend’s isn’t and I feel a type of survivors guilt about it. Is that normal?,"I (16m) started antidepressants within the same month as my friend (also 16m) did about a year ago. We both are diagnosed autistic and have serious anxiety and depression. I started on a low dose of Prozac and that was not effective so my meds were frequently changed by my prescriber until we finally found a dose and med that works for me (a high dose of Pristiq). this process was long and difficult, with many meds having negative side effects or no positive effects at all, but for the first time in my life I now feel consistently happy, content, and at peace. I haven’t felt so Ok since I was a little kid, and I now look at the world with more passion, joy, and happiness than I am used to. it’s been strange adjusting to being mentally healthy. I still struggle much more then the average person, I am developmentally disabled obviously and there’s no getting rid of that. but I am happy and ok with my life and rarely feel the regular despair and darkness that I used to feel everyday. However, my friends mental state has not changed much from what I can see since he started medication. His dosage and prescription hasn’t changed since he started, and he still feels regularly depressed, anxious, and frequently has meltdowns. he has told me that he doesn’t tell his psychiatrist how unhappy he is because he “doesnt want to be put in the ward” and so his psychiatrist believes his meds are working and has not adjusted them since. I have tried to tell him that I have told my psychiatrist many times that I have had suicidal thoughts or self harming behaviors, and she didn’t send me to the ward, she just adjusted my meds and helped me improve, but he doesn’t seem to get it. I don’t know where his distrust of medical professionals comes from, but it makes me so upset that he is unknowingly causing a barrier  for himself and isn’t improving because of it. it makes me feel really bad about myself to think of how I feel so much better then I used to and he still feels the same. it’s not fair that I have improved on treatment and he hasn’t. My newfound happiness also makes it harder for me to relate to my friend now, and some other friends I have who remain depressed. In a weird way it feels like I have grown out of them, or lost some of my connection with them, and I don’t want that to be the case because I love my friends and don’t think I should move on from them because they are mentally ill and I am recovering.

mentalhealth,1leyy5i,My job is draining my mental health - What can I do?,"I (22F) am a college student and have been working at the same fast food restaurant for a little over 2 years now. 
When I’m in school I work part time at my job, about 3 days a week, and I am in school the other 4 days of the week. Every semester I am extremely busy as I have never ending assignments and no days off. On top of that I tend to be more social when I am in school and go out with friends more often, as well as working toward building my resume as I will be graduating soon. 
When I am on break from school (winter and summer break) I work full time at my fast food job and typically after only 2 weeks of working full time I am completely drained. I get extremely stressed and have high anxiety. I also think that I get a little depressed as well because the only thing that I have energy for is work, I go to work and go home and sleep or lay in my bed till I have to work again.
It is very odd to me because when I am in school I am much busier and have less time for extra things but still find a way to make time for it. However when I am only working I have more free time but don’t utilize it at all because I am just too drained to do anything at all.
I am at a loss for what to do, I have applied to a few other jobs but still haven’t heard back. Unfortunately, I am not in the position to quit my job without having another one lined up.

mentalhealth,1ldz4k4,Advice needed on work-related mental health issues,"Please let me know if I should be posting on a different subreddit.  
I've struggled with depression and anxiety during my teaching career. I've done therapy and medication, but the best choice I made was quitting. It just wasn't a mentally sustainable career for me, and I accepted that is okay. I was lucky enough to land an administrative job within a few months, and I initially loved it.

Lately, I have become overwhelmed at work, and I am trying to care less. While discussing my work-related stress with loved ones, I have been told every job will have its challenges. But I seriously believe that I would feel much better with a different job. My original team that I'm still friends with have all quit due to a toxic work environment. I have an ""HR"" title, but most things I have learned through trial and error. While I'd love to do the actual HR work of holding safe spaces and ensuring a good working environment - there's no actual HR department here. I don't feel properly trained. Everything has to go through my boss since it's his growing company. There's a lack of accountability. I am expected to learn and do tasks on the spot, and the current workload has everyone overwhelmed - I cannot support my colleagues anymore. We're not ready to transition to a new system with little training. My boss has yelled, been passive aggressive on his bad days, and slammed doors. No consequences were given to a colleague who often sabotages other peoples' work including myself, and every time an unjustified report goes to my boss - that takes priority to avoid getting in trouble over misconstrued information. I am fine with a pay cut - I just need a bigger company that has appropriate departments (and I need health insurance). Mentally, I don't have the heart to put in the effort, and I am just waiting to get reprimanded for falling behind. Ideally, I would want to get fired and collect unemployment, but my boss always chooses one person to put blame on for everything until they eventually quit. Lately, I am starting to feel I'm next on his list due to his passive aggressive emails towards me out of the blue.

My therapist is ready to resume sessions with me this week, and I'm hoping to get some clarity. Maybe I can cope better at work or become eligible for a short term leave as I continue job hunting. Every day I feel like quitting, and while I allow myself to think ""I can walk out at any point,"" the reality is I know that's irresponsible and ideally, I should hang in there until I can switch jobs. I don't know how much longer I can take this though.

mentalhealth,1kfuzgh,How do I talk to my parents about my mental health when I'm failing classes?,"Sorry about the throwaway account.

My college semester is ending in about a week and a conversation is definitely going to come up considering I'm failing half my classes. I already know they're going to be angry about that, but I don't know how to tell them my mental health has been the cause of it all.

A little backstory: I'm currently a sophomore but I took 2 years off of school because my mental health was really bad the last time I was at college. Since then, I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been on medication since then. Last semester wasn't too bad, I got okay grades that my parents were fine with and I enjoyed being able to meet new people again and get involved with activities. For some reason though, my mental health has been awful since winter break. I barely go to my classes, have missed a bunch of work throughout the semester, and struggle to get myself out of bed most days. On top of that, my best friends are seniors and are graduating which has made everything even harder. I started self harming as well. I told my therapist about some of this (except for the sh) and they switched up my meds, but honestly I haven't felt any different. I've always been seen as the happy, helpful, considerate, easygoing person which makes me never want to ask for help because I don't want to be a burden on anyone.

My parents aren't really the most understanding people, and most arguments turn into screaming matches so I just try to avoid them as much as possible. Our relationship has been pretty rocky ever since I took time off of school and I decided the best course of action was just to not talk to them about anything concerning my mental health considering they're one of the main causes of my anxiety and depression. As far as they know, my classes have been hard but I've just been lying and saying that my grades are fine. Whenever I talk to them, they always ask if my grades are good but never ask about how I'm feeling so I just avoid it. I just don't know how I should talk to them about it considering the conversation will come up.

mentalhealth,1l6xy4c,Magnesium Deficiency: The Silent Mental Health Epidemic No One Talks About,"
Most people don’t realize it, but magnesium is one of the most critical minerals for mental health - and millions are unknowingly deficient. That’s why many experts refer to it as “the silent epidemic” of our time.

Magnesium supports over 300 biochemical processes in the body, especially those related to brain function, stress response, and emotional regulation. It helps balance neurotransmitters, keeps the nervous system in check, and even modulates cortisol, the primary stress hormone.

Low magnesium levels can lead to:

- Increased anxiety. 

- Irritability and mood swings. 

- Trouble sleeping. 

- Symptoms of depression. 


To make matters worse, chronic stress actually depletes magnesium, creating a cycle that’s hard to break.

But here’s the good news: boosting your magnesium intake - through leafy greens, nuts, seeds, dark chocolate, or quality supplements—can have a surprisingly calming and stabilizing effect on both mind and body.

A small shift, but a powerful one.

mentalhealth,1l814av,Supporting my spouse with degrading mental health,"My spouse has anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with ADHD when she was younger. She is 32 now and we've known each other and married for 5 years. Her anxiety has been progressively getting worse and even when small things don't go her way, her emotions are uncontrolled and starts to panic. She was brought up by a narcissistic mother and used to always blame her for any problem and so she has childhood trauma as well.

She quit her job last year to focus on her mental health and went to Intensive Outpatient Therapy to help with this and she was stable until the end of the program. Now she is slowly returning to her old anxious self and it feels like the outpatient program was just a temporary solution. She attempts to go to the doctor every couple of weeks thinking she has some major disease even when there aren't any symptoms related to them. I support her with all I can and regardless of what I say or do, she doesn't listen and goes into a state where she thinks nothing will help and becomes stuck in the anxious or depressive state. She has also cut cords with her friends thinking they will eventually abandon her anyway. She has a therapist and is taking medication but I don't know if it is really helping. She has a lot of notes and techniques written down from the outpatient program which I ask her to review sometimes, but she is adamant it won't help.

How can I properly support my spouse when whatever I suggest or do doesn't really help? It sometimes feels like she doesn't want to help herself. This is taking a toll on our relationship as she gets frustrated even with the smallest things and I attempt to pacify her the best I can. Any thoughts and comments are appreciated.

mentalhealth,1kv7k6i,How to start life over at 29 after severe mental and physical health problems?,"Hi there, I’m a 29 year old female who has suffered from depression, anxiety, PTSD and migraines amongst other things since a sexual assault happened when I was 15. I tried to get on with life, had decent jobs working in the NHS as a dispenser (however I struggled every week day to get up and go)  and then moved onto working on my nursing degree however my depression, migraines and anxiety worsened and I sadly had to leave. I was devastated over losing this. 

After this I became a complete recluse, I couldn’t leave my house, I had to ask my parents to temporarily care for my child as I knew I wasn’t in the best shape and this obviously worsened my depression further.  I completely cut myself off from the world, I had dissociative episodes that could last for days. If I wasn’t having those I was hallucinating (I went to the hospital twice due to this). Due to some seizures I lost some parts of my memory including the order of things but I’ve done my best to keep it as cohesive and accurate as possible. I also want to mention that a few weeks after my child went to my mums I got to the point where I wanted to just be able to put myself to sleep a lot of the time turned to online ‘prescription medication’ which I was addicted to for a few months until I had a fit and quit completely cold turkey (this was around 2-3 years ago and I haven’t touched it since) 

This is where my mum really realised my issues were so much bigger than she knew. I ended up living with my parents for a few months but the dissociative episodes continued. I couldn’t eat for days at a time, I rarely left the bedroom and then it got worse. I started having seizures which I was hospitalised for 3 times and had a further 2 after I came out. After seeing a neurologist I was told that I was shutting down mentally and physically and my body was so overwhelmed and that’s what was was causing the seizures. 

I finally, after around 8 years of waiting got some psychological help (which was sadly ended because you know… NHS🤦‍♀️) and I didn’t have the money to continue with her. I have been making good progress with my psychologist, I changed my diet and made myself eat every day and have a rough routine but now I’m alone again and terrified of going downhill again. 

My dream is to go get my degree (in a different field this time) and to be a decent working person. I also want to be healthy and get to a good weight so I can try and gain a little confidence and actually have energy and a real life again. 

This is a long story that’s even longer but I’ve tried to trim things down to the basics. How do I start over at 29? How do I even begin to approach the idea of work (which I always had a migraine at) I feel mentally in better place than I have been in years however I almost feel as though I’m walking on a tight rope, just on a knife’s edge at all times! 

If anyone can help me, or has been through the process of starting over later in life (still with the issues above) please leave a comment or message me directly.

mentalhealth,1kcf34x,What are the best free mental health resources you'd recommend?,"Asking because I won't be able to see my therapist for two months and was wondering what I could use to help with my mental health in the meantime? 

For more context, I'm a sensitive individual with mild depression and anxiety who is trying to figure out if I have ADHD and/or autism. Really hoping to speak with my therapist about whether or not medication may help.   
  
My family (especially my father), wasn't super supportive of me emotionally, whenever I had a problem I needed to vent about, and I think it's really made life more difficult for me as a 30+ year-old than it needs to be. Sometimes I just feel emotionally overwhelmed and not being able to talk to my parents about it whenever they ask how I'm doing without breaking down crying and being mocked for it (mostly due to toxic masculinity) isn't fun. 

I do have an amazing partner of 3+ years I talk to about my problems. I just feel as if I have some emotional damage I'm still trying to recover from. I've even in the past talked to people I've only known for a month or so about things bothering me and feel bad not being able to do so without getting emotional about it. 

Can anyone else relate? I'm just trying to do whatever I can to make my life a little easier while pursuing my career goals in life. 

Feel free to share whatever resources have helped you out immensly and I'd appreciate any advice you can offer. 

Have an amazing day (:

Moving out isn’t an option right now, so I’m trying to manage the best I can.

My mom (50F) has struggled for years with depression, severe anxiety, and chronic health issues. She’s also stuck in a toxic job she’s trying to leave, which has only worsened her stress. Despite advocating for herself, she hasn’t had much luck getting help from doctors.

Almost daily, she talks about her pain, stress, and lack of peace—rarely anything happy or hopeful. She says she doesn’t have time for therapy, and her emotions often spill onto me, leading to heated arguments and hurtful things said in the moment (followed by apologies later). It’s a repeating cycle, and it’s wearing me down.

I try to be patient and supportive, but it’s taking a toll on my own mental health. I usually isolate in my room to give her space, which helps somewhat but isn’t healthy long-term. I talk about this in therapy, which has helped emotionally, but there’s only so much I can do while I’m still living here.

My dad is affected too, though he keeps it bottled up. He tries to reassure her, but she seems too overwhelmed to believe things will improve.

Any advice on how I can support her—emotionally or practically—without losing myself in the process? Or how to protect my own mental health in this situation? I’d really appreciate it.

mentalhealth,1l5xdm3,Mental health concerns,"Hey there, my name is Artie (F21)
I have a history of mental health issues that I became aware of late when I was in 6th grade, and dealt with it all throughout my school career. When I was 13, I self harmed for the first time and had to go to a crisis unit for about a week, and I’ve been medicated since then. I’m currently taking 100mg of Pristiq for depression and PTSD — and 100mg of Lamotrigine for bipolar disorder.

After I graduated in ‘23, I fell headfirst into adulthood and have never been so scared. I job hopped a lot and found myself a job a few months ago that paid very well but I unfortunately was let go due to not meeting commission on time. No problem, it happens. However, I have lost almost every job I’ve had since graduation. After losing my last one, I shut myself out. I stopped going outside, and felt absolutely worthless and disappointed with myself. Finally I have a job at a gas station that’s just down the road that I started yesterday, but every time before I leave the house I get horrible anxiety and have to desperately calm myself down, clawing at anything I can to keep myself calm. I believe the reason I’ve been dealing with anxiety over it is because I’ve developed mild agoraphobia (fear of going outside).

That isn’t the only thing I’m worried about, however. The last few weeks have been awful from me mentally, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve started to notice auditory hallucinations, even hearing one yesterday during a panic attack that told me to “repent” which horrified me. During that attack, I was in the shower trying not to throw up. I had tunnel vision and felt like I wasn’t even in my own body, like I was completely detached from myself. I couldn’t tell reality from fiction. My mom had to sit in the bathroom with me for a good 30 minutes to calm me down, and I told her about the voices and sounds I’ve heard that aren’t actually there. 

This is the second time this has happened in only a few weeks. I can barely sleep properly at night, and got addicted to Benadryl briefly… after I forced myself off of that I noticed these mental issues spike up horribly. I’ve only had one visual hallucination, and I swear I could see my floor moving like water.

I’m scared, and I don’t know what to do. I’m going to be talking to my psychiatrist soon and bringing my mom with me, so I’m hoping that something can be figured out.

mentalhealth,1jrc6ze,Shocked at how quickly my mental health can deteriorate.,"five years ago I went through a serious mental health crisis. while at time the it seemed to come out of nowhere to me, looking back there was a prolonged period were clear stressors were all around me, from Covid lockdowns, deaths in the family, trouble at work, and a bad living situation. 

Long story short, I got put on anti-depressants, and did a little bit of therapy (definitely not enough). I stabilised, my living condiiton improved,  life continued.

And then a year ago, feeling good, i weaned off the anti-depressants, and felt it was behind me.

Then almost exactly a year later BANG i'm absolutely inundated with anxiety, as intense as when i got them 5 years ago. Thoughts of self harm which I haven't had for years immediately returned. 

The difference this time, is I can see I am starting to spiral and am reaching out for help now as opposed to just trying to ignore it like it did last time. 

But as the title says, I'm kinda stunned that these feelings which i felt were gone have flipped right back on as if someone has turned a switch in my brain. It's the suddenness! 

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this

mentalhealth,1k7l4pi,I have been in a really good mood all week. But then my cousin’s bf (who I’ve met twice) started harassing me over messenger. Now that’s two weeks forward one step back in my mental health.,"AITA? My cousin let me move in with them. It was too much money and I could barely buy food let alone pay their rent on top of my own debt. Eventually I explained to them that I couldn’t survive like this anymore and had decided to move closer to my parents so I’d have a better support network. 

I had originally agreed to stay with my cousin for three months and I lasted two months. My cousin was a bit annoyed that I was leaving early and asked if I could pay her for two more weeks while she finds someone else. I agreed and have paid her for two weeks. 
I felt guilty and apologised and explained that I know it sh*tty, and I feel bad and don’t want us to end things on bad terms. She just said it was fine and said it is what it is. 
The night before though she had sat about six feet away from me, talking about me to a friend on the phone and crying. 

Anyway, as I was going home my cousins brother messaged me asking if I wanted to meet up (btw he never contacts his sister and his sister is kind of sick of him (that’s important)). I say no I’m going home and I explain why. Then he texts back saying “I don’t care about your mental health. You promised to help my sister with rent for three months you need to pay her what you owe her.” He was the one who suggested I move in with her as a way to help me with things I was going through. He told me off via text and talked down my parents and myself. And then he said “im blocking you on everything “ (he’s in his mid thirties btw. )

Anyway, I came home, I moved on, I dealt with my guilt and I was doing really well mentally and physically. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for years so I felt I was in a really good place. 

Then tonight I’m minding my own business when my cousins brothers boyfriend texted me saying “I heard you’ve moved “. I say yes. Then he goes right into asking if I’ve paid my cousin without skipping a beat. I explained that her and I have discussed it and I’ve paid it. I told him not to do his bfs dirty work for him, and that if the brother wanted to talk to me he should do it himself instead of going through someone else(why else would the bf be messaging me). Then he goes on about how I know nothing about the world and there will be problems if I say that about the brother again.  

I asked him if that was a threat? (I’m a very small and thin female and he is a six foot male). He said no and said that I was defaming him by asking if it was a threat. He said there would be legal problems, but if what I say is true — that I’ve paid my cousin — then that’s fine. 
I said yes it’s true and told him and her brother to ring her and ask if they’re so worried. He hasn’t replied. But it’s ruined my night. I just want these people out of my life. 

My cousin and I had already come to an agreement but if the brother and bf ring her, it’s her word against mine. I don’t think she would lie about our agreement but I just don’t know if can trust her now after everything her own brother has done. 

Am I in the wrong? Any advice? Yes I’m aware I never should’ve moved in with her in the first place and I should’ve thought my finances through before going ahead with the move. But I don’t think I’ve deserved to be treated like this — let alone be harassed by some guy I’ve met twice when we were both drinking.

mentalhealth,1l1ixcr,My 15 year Battle with mental health HOPE,"Hello all,

I’m sharing my story in hopes it spares someone the 15 years I lost.

I grew up in a loving, stable home no trauma, no dysfunction. I served in the military but saw no combat. Toward the end of my service, anxiety started to surface and escalated after I got out. I began isolating and drinking to cope, which only worsened everything. My anxiety became so severe I’d abandon my groceries just to avoid standing in line.

A panic attack while driving sent me to the VA. I was prescribed Zoloft, which helped the anxiety but caused weight gain, emotional numbness, and ED devastating as a man in his 20s. I quit cold turkey and was switched to Klonopin as needed. I used it responsibly until I began mixing it with alcohol. After blackouts and frightening symptoms, I eventually stopped meds altogether. The anxiety faded slightly, but emotional disconnection persisted.

Years passed. My wife moved in, and I continued to withdraw. My family was concerned, but I didn’t realize how much. A dental issue triggered a depressive episode my first brush with suicidal thoughts. My parents helped get me to a doctor, and I started Paxil. It worked, but the emotional flatness remained.

We had a daughter after two years of IVF, then a surprise pregnancy months later. Our son was born with serious health issues, survived surgery, and is thriving. Yet I felt disconnected. I was working, going to school, earning promotions, and doing everything “right,” but inside, nothing felt right.

Therapy didn’t seem to help. Then my father the most important person in my life, was diagnosed with dementia. It broke me. I increased my meds again and entered another depressive fog. With no singular trauma to unpack, therapy felt directionless. In desperation, I turned to the internet for introspection a space where I could explore the thoughts no one else wanted to hear.

Then something unexpected happened.

I had gained weight despite eating less and exercising. My diet? Meat, bread, cheese, yogurt, and fried foods no fruits or vegetables for over a decade. Literally none, aside from jalapeños. I always thought poor nutrition just led to weight issues, not mental health problems.

Eventually, I learned that deficiencies in magnesium, zinc, tryptophan, iron, and vitamin E severely impact mood, sleep, and brain function. When these are lacking, the brain runs on cortisol, the stress hormone, keeping the body in survival mode: high anxiety, digestive issues, depression, emotional blunting. Alcohol raises cortisol further. I had unknowingly lived in fight-or-flight mode for years.

I looked for something I could stomach to cover the gaps and found trail mix. Within 10 days of consistent intake, I began to feel a shift.

The disconnection started lifting. Depression eased. I began losing weight (a side effect of lower cortisol), snacking less, and finally feeling like myself again.

Even if nutrition isn’t the root cause of your struggle, it absolutely plays a role. I wish I had known sooner the cost of not knowing was 15 years of suffering. If you relate to any of this, please look into the nutritional side of mental health. Or I can respond to DMS

TL;DR:

I avoided fruits and vegetables for 15 years, which led to nutrient deficiencies that made my brain rely on cortisol (the stress hormone), causing years of anxiety, depression, and emotional detachment. Adding trail mix to restore those nutrients changed everything.",1,0,hello all i m sharing my story in hopes it spares someone the years i lost i grew up in a loving stable home no trauma no dysfunction i served in the military but saw no combat toward the end of my service anxiety started to surface and escalated after i got out i began isolating and drinking to cope which only worsened everything my anxiety became so severe i d abandon my groceries just to avoid standing in line a panic attack while driving sent me to the va i was prescribed zoloft which helped the anxiety but caused weight gain emotional numbness and ed devastating as a man in his s i quit cold turkey and was switched to klonopin as needed i used it responsibly until i began mixing it with alcohol after blackouts and frightening symptoms i eventually stopped meds altogether the anxiety faded slightly but emotional disconnection persisted years passed my wife moved in and i continued to withdraw my family was concerned but i didn t realize how much a dental issue triggered a depressive episode my first brush with suicidal thoughts my parents helped get me to a doctor and i started paxil it worked but the emotional flatness remained we had a daughter after two years of ivf then a surprise pregnancy months later our son was born with serious health issues survived surgery and is thriving yet i felt disconnected i was working going to school earning promotions and doing everything right but inside nothing felt right therapy didn t seem to help then my father the most important person in my life was diagnosed with dementia it broke me i increased my meds again and entered another depressive fog with no singular trauma to unpack therapy felt directionless in desperation i turned to the internet for introspection a space where i could explore the thoughts no one else wanted to hear then something unexpected happened i had gained weight despite eating less and exercising my diet meat bread cheese yogurt and fried foods no fruits or vegetables for over a decade literally none aside from jalape os i always thought poor nutrition just led to weight issues not mental health problems eventually i learned that deficiencies in magnesium zinc tryptophan iron and vitamin e severely impact mood sleep and brain function when these are lacking the brain runs on cortisol the stress hormone keeping the body in survival mode high anxiety digestive issues depression emotional blunting alcohol raises cortisol further i had unknowingly lived in fight or flight mode for years i looked for something i could stomach to cover the gaps and found trail mix within days of consistent intake i began to feel a shift the disconnection started lifting depression eased i began losing weight a side effect of lower cortisol snacking less and finally feeling like myself again even if nutrition isn t the root cause of your struggle it absolutely plays a role i wish i had known sooner the cost of not knowing was years of suffering if you relate to any of this please look into the nutritional side of mental health or i can respond to dms tl dr i avoided fruits and vegetables for years which led to nutrient deficiencies that made my brain rely on cortisol the stress hormone causing years of anxiety depression and emotional detachment adding trail mix to restore those nutrients changed everything,-0.0016220238095238189,-0.998,NEGATIVE,0.9983723759651184,neutral,negative,negative

mentalhealth,1ksnxdm,Wedding and mental health,"Not sure where else to turn to here, don’t know what I want from this but here goes. Please don’t think I’m a horrible person. 

My best friend and I met in a mental health hospital 10 years ago. Our friendship hasn’t revolved around having that in common, we just happened to meet there at the lowest point in our lives. We both have ADHD, borderline personality disorder, anxiety & depression. But we are high functioning, got our degrees and have good careers and moved out of our parents . 

Everything has been amazing for the last few years. I asked her to be my Maid of Honour in 2023 for my wedding now in 6 weeks time. She has been so excited in every step of the process. She had been planning my bachelorette with the other two bridesmaids.

Then all of a sudden, communication stopped. Her mom told my mom that she had been diagnosed with bipolar and wouldn’t be attending the wedding. This was 2 months ago. I’ve tried to talk to her since as she hasn’t actually said anything herself to me. 

I know how hard it must be but a few messages between our moms isn’t enough communication. I’m not expecting a full explanation or details she doesn’t want to share. But I have nothing to go by. One minute, my best friend and I are planning my wedding, the next she is no longer herself and life is upside down. I known on the day, my heart will ache for her. She is irreplaceable to me.

All I’ve been told is that she’s been struggling with her bipolar diagnosis. I’ve tried to read up on it but I just can’t piece anything together. I’m fully aware that her mental health is far more important than my wedding. But I just can’t think why she can’t tell me. I know she doesn’t want to upset me but it’s upsetting me more that she’s just cut me off. 

I’m struggling to see why she can’t attend the wedding even as a guest and what’s going on in her head. She is staying with her parents, and not in a hospital. What has bipolar done to her that has caused this?  I know nobody apart from her can tell me that. But this will be weighing on her and I know the guilt will be consuming her. She’s even quit the job she loves. 

Not sure if any one has any advice. I’m trying to give her space and won’t be messaging her any more as I don’t want to stress her out. But I’m now really struggling with my mental health knowing that the biggest day of my life will be without my best friend. Every picture will have her missing. Every laugh will be consumed with guilt that she isn’t with isn’t there. She is one of the most important people in the world to me.

My future father in law died last September, he was so looking forward to the wedding. So I know what it feels like to have someone close to us not being able to come. We have come to terms with it as much as we can, since he is no longer physically with us. But my best friend will be at home. Of course id rather her be at home than not with us at all, but I still don’t understand why. I’ve even offered to have her on FaceTime for the ceremony, she hasn’t responded. But why has my wedding triggered her this much? 

The lead up to my wedding has been awful. Father in law died. Mother in Law has cancer. Grandfather has cancer. I’ve broken my ankle 6 weeks before. My maid of honour isn’t going to be there.

TLDR: maid of honour has been diagnosed with bipolar. Been told she won’t come to the wedding now and isn’t talking to me.

mentalhealth,1krqipx,I think I have ADHD & other mental health issues,"I was watching a show and the character is has OCD (which is obviously stated in the show). She was canvassing her apartmetn because she is paranoid that a guy (next door neighbor coincidentally) is following her. She does a sweep in her apartment and obsessively checks to see if her gas line and doors are locked. 

This made me realize I used to do something similar in my teens and even now. If everyone were gone, I would walk around the house with a knife and check every room, closet, cupboard, etc. I know my home was safe, but I just had to. Or many times, I would leave the house for school, I would lock the door, but I would forget. I would spend the whole school day anxious that someone would come in and steal all of our things because I ""forgot"" to lock the door. 

I also have a weird thing of thinking I'm dying all the time. My legs were cramping yesterday at work due to a) not eating anything for the day, and b) not drinking enough water lately. I was also on my period if that changes anything. But as I was walking around I was so scared that this was a sign of a stroke coming along. I do this quite often if I think my body is different than my normal functions. I would go down a rabbit hole on Google and essentially WebMD myself until I can't anymore. I had gone to the doctor on campus because I would wake up every night for a week with pain to my stomach. I initially thought it was indigestion, but it would wake me up out of my sleep every night at 4-5 AM. Being a health nut, I thought it was appendicitis and was convinced my appendix would burst. I had tests and blood drawn just for everything to come back normal. Apparently, it was caused by stress from school and financially, so I had to do therapy again. 

I possibly have symptoms of ADHD. I have a huge problem with processing information. Everything sounds like gibberish to me, and I need people to repeat 10x over before understanding. I also have something along the lines of executive dysfunction, brain fog, and severe time blindness. My older sister, who has severe ADHD, told me that I should be tested for it as I display very similar symptoms to her. I am just very overwhelmed and busy with school to go. I genuinely fear having a potential diagnosis for any of these things. 

 I have been to therapy at my university and gotten a prognosis for anxiety, depression, and a few symptoms of OCD. My therapist/counselor wrote in my therapy notes that I had shown a great affinity towards PDD: Pervasive Developmental Disorder. I never told my therapist about the suspected OCD symptoms. It seemed insignificant until I was watching this show. 

I guess I am asking for some guidance to see if I am just in over my head and simply overthinking, or needing to actually get this checked out.

I do want to note that my sister was diagnosed with ADHD 7ish years ago and takes medication. My cousin (paternal) has BPD and ADHD as well. I don't know if that is significant, but I'm sharing if it is.

mentalhealth,1kylqc7,I feel like my friend’s mental health depends on me and I’m really scared.,"2 years ago I met a guy that was in the same class as me. He wanted to join my friend group but they kind of rejected him. I felt bad cause I thought he was really nice and funny, and started to be friend with him.  
I’ve been friend with this guy for 2 years now, and I rejected his advances like 6 months ago. It didn’t affect our relationship. 

However, he has been diagnosed with depression 2 months ago. I try to be here for him but here’s the problem: 
I feel like he sees me as his only hope.

I do my best to see him when he asks me to, as much as I can, have a lot of work at the university and I have severe anxiety so I’m really really anxious about going out.                                              He asks me to go out with him every week, what is nearly impossible for me because of my mental state and my exams, so I sometimes refuse.
But he starts to ask me to call him more and more, because he’s sad, even if I told him many times that I could listen to him, but by text messages if possible. 
He says that he prefers to call me instead, and I always end to call him because I’m scared that he does something bad, but it gives me panic attacks. 

He always asks to call or see me when he’s sad and I don’t know what to do cause I’m also having a really hard time and I need to stay alone more than everything. 

I feel trapped, I want to be here for him but I don’t want his mental health to depend on me and my attention. I think about it 24/7.

Please, I don’t know what to do, I need advices. What do I have to do ?

mentalhealth,1ky5yop,Mental health issues with the medication field,"(If this isnt structured well or I misspelled anything its because my meds are kicking in and I am very exhausted but wanted to talk about this)

I'm currently 17 years old and I've been on and off of medications for my mental health since I was 14. I've been on 9 different meds (usually 1 or 2 at a time) such as Lithium,  Lexapro and Prozac. 

My official diagnosis are PTSD (with anxiety and panic) and unspecified mood disorder with bpd clusters.  Although the psychiatrist who has been given me meds since I was 14 seems to be tol focused on the fact I may be bipolar. 

Listen I know I'm no professional and she is but I haven't really shown many signs of bipolar disorder.  The only thing she is stuck on is some cases of hypomania I've dealth with (as far as I can remember it is not a frequent thing and only started when I started medication). My father is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my sister was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder (she has bpd). And my emotions are a constant up and down. I go through very intense emotions every day multiple times.

My ""hypomania"" episodes consisted of feeling more energized, overly confident and Paranoia. The longest ive ever stood up for in these episodes was 28 hours. I would say I find myself to be more depressed than deal with mania though.

This professional constantly brings up the hypomania episodes I had a few times which I have not dealt with since February of this year.

I originally started medication for depression due to my PTSD and because I cannot regulate my emotions. I always feel like they control me more than I control them. It makes things like school and having relationships with people very difficult for me.

Ive had a rough time with medication, none of them really working for me. I was on lithium (750 mg, started at age 15 and ended January of this year) and I felt it did not help. I had requested to be taken off of it a year in and she told me it would make my ""manic episodes worse"". She had also brought up testing for ADHD and told me I may be able to get meds for that if I'm diagnosed, she later told me she wouldn't put me on those meds even if I got diagnosed because it would make my mania worse.
Other situations that have happened were smaller but I'll say two just incase. She had told me she thinks meds are always needed for me and if I am not medicated my mania may get worse and I may experience psychosis. 

This year I finally got her to listen to me and take me off of meds from January up until this month. 

I scheduled a appointment because my emotions were too intense for me to handle and I didn't feel in control of myself as much as I would like to be. She put me on Trileptal (I'm unaware of how many mg but I take one in the morning and one at night). Its been around 2 weeks so I'm giving it some time but the only difference I am seeing is I'm constantly exhausted and I've been having weird vivid dreams. 

I hope this works and to me I feel like I may need to switch to a different psychiatrist due to how this treatment has been going. I'm unsure if I'm overreacting by saying that but I don't think I'm getting the treatment I think I need because she is too focused on the idea of me possibly having bipolar disorder. 

I might read this back and edit whatever I need to but this is pretty much all of it.

I would really like to be inspired by some ideas. 😊

I suffer from anxiety and many depresseions and I tend to always tell to much, overshare, and I absolutely hate all people's follow up questions, when I start answering why I have more time than others. 

I have many friends I know from hospital, and those with PTSD seems to me like they just answer that they suffer from PTSD to new persons, and the person stop asking more.

I don't  know if people fear a really tragic story if they ask into the PTSD trauma, so I would like to also answer like ""PTSD from a really horrible accident"", bc that would maybe make people stop asking more. 

But for me it's not the truthful story, I suffer from anxiety and depression and an endless concussion after a sailing accident. And I would really like to be honest.

How can I tell people a truthful answer about my mental health but also make them stop asking more follow up questions, bc those always lead to the same ""good advices"" about something they don't much about. 

Any suggestions? How do you manage how much you are telling people before you get good friends with maybe just one of them?

We currently live in small town outside of Wilmington, NC. In 2019 I joined our Volunteer Fire/Rescue. I loved EMS and soon found myself one step away from being a Paramedic. I grew up with trauma in my life, sexually abused in Boy Scouts, my mother’s untimely departure from my life by running off with the minister of our church when I was 16, and my failed relationships and marriages along the way. I turned to alcohol to help cope with the anxiety and depression. I struggle daily and try to cope but I feel I am losing the battle. I have lost two friends and coworkers during my time the past 6 years. We are short staffed for AEMT’s and find myself having to cover multiple shifts throughout the week. I have tried resigning from the department two times and always end up coming back because our Chief says “I need you”. I work in rural EMS and have worked my fair share of gruesome traumas and death with little or no emotion. I have lived my life especially during my 20 years in the military with a sense of responsibility towards others, and find myself not being able to say enough is enough for fear of being labeled as a quitter. My mental health is suffering I am suffering. I don’t smoke and of this writing I haven’t had a drink in 3 weeks. I need help!!

Studies indicate a correlation between excessive use and increased feelings of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the constant comparison to seemingly perfect lives portrayed online can lead to low self-esteem. On the positive side, social media can also foster community and support, providing a platform for connection. It offers a space for individuals to share experiences and seek help. Ultimately, recognizing both sides of this dynamic relationship is key to understanding the overall **impact of social media on mental health**.

 However, I'm in year 12 now. I have about 2 fruends that i like and would genuinely hang out with. I hate my college. I just see thabfces of people from high-school in the halls. I can't move on from the past. I hate the bus. It makes me anxious because if we don't get the seats we usually get ill have to disturb someone else and I'm fat so I take up a lot of room and that isn't fair on them. I scored mostly 7s at gcse which is good ik but i could have done better if id worked harder. I've got my first job and I absolutely hate it. It's 7.5 hours stood on my feet serving parents and kids at some kids activity place. I wake up at odd times during the night after having nightmares about serving people and getting orders wrong. The whole place makes my anxiety light up. And im so irresponsiblewoth my pay cueques that i fear im doomed to become bad with money like my parents who have no savings. . I applied to be head student at school and I didn't get it, but some of the students who did are just as useless as me. I'm not upset I didn't get it, I'm upset that the people who did are so similar to me and yet they were picked instead. What changed since year 10 when I was picked that I'm not longer worthy.

Now all I do when I get home is cry. I've got mocks tomorrow's at school and they predict my a level results. They are what unis see for my grades and I don't think I'll do very well. I can't afford to fail and disappointed my family. I'm supposed to be the academic star. My grandparents fought hard for their financial success and stability and they've been so generous. They deserve to see a result for they're investment.

I’m talking about the ones who look like they have it all together but are silently dealing with burnout, anxiety, ADHD, depression, or just feeling emotionally exhausted.

The goal is to create a space where women can drop the mask, feel seen, and actually get support. I want it to feel safe, real, and genuinely helpful not just surface level wellness ..

Here’s what I have so far:
- Group therapy circles on topics like burnout, trauma, ADHD, and high functioning depression
- Mini mental health screenings
-A Q and A panel with Black mental health providers
- Referrals and mental health resources
- What would make something like this feel worth attending to you or someone you know?
- What activities or features would actually feel helpful?
- Any interactive ideas that could help women feel less alone?
- Would you prefer informal, cozy vibes or more structured and professional?

mentalhealth,1js1dg9,My mental health has plummeted over the last few months and I don’t know what to do anymore…,"I just need to vent. 23F and my mental health is in shambles. I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety issues for which I have been in therapy for and on medication for the last couple years. 
I wake up on most days feeling absolutely demoralised and demotivated, with no purpose or idea how to go about picking up the pieces of what is left of my life. 
I lost my dad, my superhero, just about 5 months ago and my entire world came crumbling down soon after. For anyone who has experienced parental loss, I’m sorry. My heart goes out to you. It’s one thing losing a parent, it’s another when you just keep slipping further down in the aftermath. 
I come from a relatively upper-middle class upbringing, and from some family money. My father started a business a couple years ago, where my mom and elder brother also work. I did too, until I lost dad and now I can’t bear to go into the office because it’s insufferable. Every time I walk past his cabin- lights out and smelling damp- it reminds me of a better time that was, when I was happy. I’m not happy anymore. 
In the months following my fathers very unexpected passing away, we have not only lost almost all our money (settling a shitload of debt my dad left behind that he was trying to sort out for a while now), but are also on the brink of losing our company and home. I was used to a life where I had the liberty of following my life’s passion without worrying much about the more nuanced things like groceries and bills. Since dad, all that has changed. 
To make matters more complicated, in a fit of trying to gain back control or I don’t know what, I cheated on my angel of a boyfriend of 3 years. He has honestly been the most supportive presence in my life and I hate myself everyday for what I did. Living with this guilt has become insufferable. While he has forgiven me, we are no longer together. He’s still very much a part of my life but I know the possibility of him leaving is so wide open that it keeps me up in the middle of the night. 
I have lost my appetite, I can’t sleep anymore. My eating disorder is at an all time high (I’m bulimic) and nothing is more torturous than having to get out of bed in the morning. I worry. All the time and about everything. 
I have tried to end myself too, resulting in a hospitalisation that has left me feeling even more like a failure and a liability. 
I have also recently figured out (with the help of my ex-boyfriend) that I’m a compulsive liar. I never consciously recognised this trait up until now. It has come to my attention that this trait has potential of ruining my life even more than it is now but I don’t know what to do about it. 
My therapist for the last 4 years has decided to move away and I do not have the energy or courage to go around on another hunt to find someone else. 
Life is throwing me curveball after another and I’m afraid I’ve run out of patience. Everyone I speak to keeps telling me it will take time for things to settle down and that I need to be there for my mom and brother too but I can’t seem to muster up the courage to go through anything anymore. I just want my old life back. I used to have a family, a boyfriend who adored me, friends who supported me and a career that was doing well. I now have nothing. And I just don’t know what to do anymore. How to start living again. I just don’t know… ",2,4,i just need to vent f and my mental health is in shambles i have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety issues for which i have been in therapy for and on medication for the last couple years i wake up on most days feeling absolutely demoralised and demotivated with no purpose or idea how to go about picking up the pieces of what is left of my life i lost my dad my superhero just about months ago and my entire world came crumbling down soon after for anyone who has experienced parental loss i m sorry my heart goes out to you it s one thing losing a parent it s another when you just keep slipping further down in the aftermath i come from a relatively upper middle class upbringing and from some family money my father started a business a couple years ago where my mom and elder brother also work i did too until i lost dad and now i can t bear to go into the office because it s insufferable every time i walk past his cabin lights out and smelling damp it reminds me of a better time that was when i was happy i m not happy anymore in the months following my fathers very unexpected passing away we have not only lost almost all our money settling a shitload of debt my dad left behind that he was trying to sort out for a while now but are also on the brink of losing our company and home i was used to a life where i had the liberty of following my life s passion without worrying much about the more nuanced things like groceries and bills since dad all that has changed to make matters more complicated in a fit of trying to gain back control or i don t know what i cheated on my angel of a boyfriend of years he has honestly been the most supportive presence in my life and i hate myself everyday for what i did living with this guilt has become insufferable while he has forgiven me we are no longer together he s still very much a part of my life but i know the possibility of him leaving is so wide open that it keeps me up in the middle of the night i have lost my appetite i can t sleep anymore my eating disorder is at an all time high i m bulimic and nothing is more torturous than having to get out of bed in the morning i worry all the time and about everything i have tried to end myself too resulting in a hospitalisation that has left me feeling even more like a failure and a liability i have also recently figured out with the help of my ex boyfriend that i m a compulsive liar i never consciously recognised this trait up until now it has come to my attention that this trait has potential of ruining my life even more than it is now but i don t know what to do about it my therapist for the last years has decided to move away and i do not have the energy or courage to go around on another hunt to find someone else life is throwing me curveball after another and i m afraid i ve run out of patience everyone i speak to keeps telling me it will take time for things to settle down and that i need to be there for my mom and brother too but i can t seem to muster up the courage to go through anything anymore i just want my old life back i used to have a family a boyfriend who adored me friends who supported me and a career that was doing well i now have nothing and i just don t know what to do anymore how to start living again i just don t know,0.06352201257861635,0.9723,NEGATIVE,0.9992334842681885,positive,positive,negative
mentalhealth,1ket2np,How can I be successful in college while also struggling with my mental health?,"Disclaimer:  This post was also made in r/advice but I am unsure as to the kind of response I will get there so I am submitting it here instead. 

I (20F) am a sophomore in college at a university that isn't fancy or anything but it is still a decent school. I have had a hard time balancing my school work with taking care of myself. I struggle with anxiety specifically surrounding people, big spaces and checking my grades. I have depression that can knock me down for weeks at a time, makes me an enabler to my own procrastination. In addition to those things, my ADHD makes it almost impossible for me to compartmentalize the things that i should be prioritizing in order to get them done and I have a bad habit of splitting in regards to my schoolwork; either I give it my all or I give nothing at all. 

I really want to do better not just academically but in terms of taking care of myself and making better decisions, but I constantly feel behind or as if I am mentally drained. I've just been wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position and how they managed through it, or if anyone has advice on staying motivated, managing stress and keeping up with assignments as well as personal issues without burning out?

I understand that the root to most of my issues is my lack of discipline and nothing will be solved overnight but I would like to at least try my best to get insight and feedback about how I can be better.

mentalhealth,1k7g214,I feel guilty about my mental and physical health issues,"Hi, i (NB18), live with my mom(F49), and dad(M68), and i have a bf(M20)
I was born with sight loss, a condition from my mom's family, which on it's own would not be that big of a problem, but when you're like me society gives you hell, i suffered in my academic life 'cause of my disability and many other issues, i have severe trauma from many events in my life, i couldn't write it all down in here if i tried. 
i became depressed and anxious when i was around 11 years old, i've been on therapy for 8 years, and i take multiple meds for my simptoms. 
I've already been through the worst of depression, i was around 15yo when i truly started to heal, which, not coincidentaly, was when i met my boyfriend, he's the light of my life, i need him more than i can say, we were both in a very dark space back then, and we would have died if not for eachother, we've been together for 3 years now, and will marry. 
Sadly, i can't deny the effects of my poor mental health, even after so many years of trying to heal myself from it all, i still have periods of time when i can barely sleep or eat, and my intrusive thoughts plague me, i get overwhelmed by things that don't seem to phase others. Just 3 weeks ago, my mom went to another country to visit my aunt, and after a week of her absence, the household chores started to really make me anxious, i started having trouble sleeping again, and eating's been very dificult, taking care of my dog has been hard too, and my intrusive thoughts, which are usually the violent type, make me so paralysed i can barely look and my dad and dog, the only person i trust completely in times like this, is my beloved, i run to him because he gets me, he holds me as i cry, and i say that i'm sorry for making him worry, for always ending up sick again after a few months of normalcy, and he tells me that it's ok, i have nothing to be sorry for, none of this is my fault and i'm trying my best. Deep down, i know he's right, he loves me through sickness and health, he knows me better than i know myself, and still, i lay awake at night sometimes, thinking that loving me is a troublesome thing, wondering why my body tortures me, with a low blood pressure that won't get better no matter what i do, i despair over small things like a pile of laundry because i can't help myself, and i'm trying so hard to get better.
Just a few hours ago, my mom got home, and i'm a mess, i took my emergency pills (a very strong med for anxiety) 3 times in the last week, i've been going crazy alone with my dad in this house, and only being able to see my love from time to time, my anxiety has been killing me as i worked around the house and tried to keep myself together through all the noise my dad makes, he's quite the noisy man, and eating and sleeping has been so hard, and i cried on my mom's shoulder when she came in cause i missed her so much, and even with my love's help, it's been so dificult. And now, as usual, she's worried about me. 
Even if i shouldn't, i feel like a burden, i hate that the path to healing is not linear, i hate not having an explanation for the way i feel, and i especially hate feeling like i'm making the people i love suffer. 
I don't know what to do with myself, i'm sorry if the post is confusing, i never had to do one of these, i just need to pour this out of me, even if it's incoherrent, so if you're reading this and you have advice, or just some kind words of encouragement, i'd be grateful.

mentalhealth,108uehy,Fuck the US Healthcare System! America is a terrible country for mental health!,"Early last year, I thought I had decent insurance because I could see a psychiatrist for $25. Then Oscar Health decided to arbitrarily cancel my plan in the middle of the year and automatically enroll me in a ""similar plan"". Similar my ass! - I now had to pay $90 to see the same psychiatrist.  Fuck you Oscar Health! Now my new insurance for this year is refusing to pay for a medicine I'm prescribed because it's not a ""preferred medicine"". My doctor prescribed the ""preferred medicine"" for me to save money, but I ended up having a huge depressive/anxiety episode while on it! I ended up going back on the old medication because I felt so bad on the ""preferred medicine"". Did it ever occur to anyone that the preferred medicine might not work for everyone and there is a reason that these non-preferred medicines are still being manufactured? On top of that when I do need to see a psychiatrist, I have to book appointments several weeks in advance because he ""has such a busy schedule"".

I lived abroad for 8 years in Japan and South Korea, but now that I'm back in my home country my mental health has taken a turn for the worse - this is mainly due to the horrible mental healthcare (and healthcare in general situation) in the US. While there was probably more stigma against mental healthcare in Japan/Korea than the US, I didn't have to wait very long to see a psychiatrist. I was able to get medication and not worry if I would be able to afford it or not.

mentalhealth,1jd8dnq,When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,"Lately I’ve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being “weak” and affected . I know it’s not true but I also wonder if it’s true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you’re a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it …. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I’ve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I’m  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I’ve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I’m terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn’s , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I’ve been trying to manage everything in my head and it’s not executing properly . I can’t even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I’m supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it’s an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I’m also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I’m so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it’s an excuse and I’m not allowed because I didn’t do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It’s driving me crazy . I’m so overwhelmed and it’s making me freeze and depressed and I just don’t want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

mentalhealth,1kbj0th,Parent of Child with Severe Health Anxiety,"My 21 year old son has severe health anxiety that has gone completely put of control for the past year. He has had several fears about different illnesses during this time. We have never wanted to risk ignoring a real health issue so every time we took him to doctors for checks and tests. Every time it came back normal and the advice we get is that he needs mental health care ( therapy or medications). He had seen therapists and tried SSRIs in the past with limited success. Most recently he has decided that he has a condition that is largely unknown to the medical community but that has an online community of people who believe they suffer from this condition. I don't know if the condition is real or not or if it impacts him or not. He has seen multiple doctors who specialize in this area. None found anything wrong with him and most doubt his feared condition even exists. They also recommend therapy. He accepts that he has depression and anxiety but always says he would be much better if only he didn't have this condition. 

We don't know what to do. His life consists of constant worry and panic attacks. We have to sleep with him some nights to calm him down so he can sleep. We have encouraged him to take therapy but he is convinced it doesn't work. Personally I doubt therapy can be effective for someone who doesn't believe in the process. He absolutely refuses medications. 

What do we do? Our lives are a disaster. My wife and I are working together to support him  but our previously healthy relationship is strained. I am anxious and severely depressed. She is angry and frustrated. I see no way out of this situation and worry that the rest of our lives will consist of caring for a mentally ill son or grieving his suicide. I find myself pondering painless ways to take my own life. I won't because it wouldn't be fair to my wife and kids including the sick one. I also retain hope that some day we will get to the other side. But I do wonder if I can every find happiness again when my son is suffering so much.

I have spoken to therapists before. They tell me I'm a good dad and advise everything from tough love to refusing to give advice about helping my son. I don't find that particularly helpful. I love my son so much. He is a beautiful person inside and out. He could have an amazing life if he could get past this.

This is starting to feel like a long vent but I would like to hear from other parents of adult children who experienced similar issues. What worked for you and what didn't? How did you find happiness when your child was suffering? Any advice?

mentalhealth,1jtccze,Mental Health Numbness,"Hello, I (23f) am newer to this thread. Recently, I’ve been in a mental health block. I’m currently medicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and ADHD. I’ve been through this loop before and somehow made it through it, but how do I prevent this from happening?

I lost a family member a few months ago, and I just lost my grandma a few weeks ago. I’m watching family members around me grieve, or at least trying to. My father doesn’t know how to grieve since this was his first death that hit home the most. He isn’t taking care of himself and is refusing any help. Granted, it’s only been a few weeks, but seeing him like this is hard. He’s a middle-aged man who was told he isn’t allowed to feel emotions because that’s “not what men do.” My family and I are trying to convince him otherwise, but that’s generational trauma for you. Heck, I don’t grieve people’s deaths, either. I don’t know how. I held her hand and sobbed as I looked at her. I was in my grandma's house a few hours after she passed in the hospital, looking through her things, looking for papers needed for the death certificate. 

Before anyone says anything, I know how I handle my emotions isn’t correct. I often push most of my feelings to the back of my mind and wait for one final thing to take me over the edge, where I have a full meltdown over the multitude of issues I’ve been bottling up. Until that moment hits, I become numb. I sit there emotionless as I watch life go by. Others see it as I self isolate and no one knows what to do. They’ll ask me how I’m doing and if everything is okay, but I don’t have an answer because I genuinely don’t know how I feel. No one can help because I don’t know what’s wrong with me either. This is a repetitive cycle that continues on and on. I don’t even know what to do. I just want to sob so hard that I can’t breathe, my head pounds, where I shake, my nose is a faucet, and I have to gasp for air over and over again. Sadly, when I go through that, it makes me feel alive, that I’m still here, that I’m not in a constant loop of life, and that I can feel emotions other than numbness. 

I don’t want to watch a TV show or read a book that makes me sad because, sure, that can work, but then I’ll overthink that book or movie, and that would be a constant loop in my head. I've been there, done that. I’m trying therapy again, but it’s been a while since the last time due to financials. 

I’m unsure why I’m writing this, other than asking how I do not feel like this? How do I get rid of the numbness? No cliche answers of “go outside,” “exercise,” or “spend time with loved ones.” My loved ones are also depressed, and I can’t help them if I’m like this. I’m the one who helps others when they’re down, but I can’t do that because I’m giving up paddling the water below me. I’m drowning.  I’m tired of feeling like this or having this be so reoccurring. I’m tired; I’m exhausted. I’m tired of paddling.

I apologize for my long-winded rant; I just needed to put something out there that wasn’t in my journal or notes app. ",2,3,hello i f am newer to this thread recently i ve been in a mental health block i m currently medicated for major depressive disorder generalized anxiety and adhd i ve been through this loop before and somehow made it through it but how do i prevent this from happening i lost a family member a few months ago and i just lost my grandma a few weeks ago i m watching family members around me grieve or at least trying to my father doesn t know how to grieve since this was his first death that hit home the most he isn t taking care of himself and is refusing any help granted it s only been a few weeks but seeing him like this is hard he s a middle aged man who was told he isn t allowed to feel emotions because that s not what men do my family and i are trying to convince him otherwise but that s generational trauma for you heck i don t grieve people s deaths either i don t know how i held her hand and sobbed as i looked at her i was in my grandma's house a few hours after she passed in the hospital looking through her things looking for papers needed for the death certificate before anyone says anything i know how i handle my emotions isn t correct i often push most of my feelings to the back of my mind and wait for one final thing to take me over the edge where i have a full meltdown over the multitude of issues i ve been bottling up until that moment hits i become numb i sit there emotionless as i watch life go by others see it as i self isolate and no one knows what to do they ll ask me how i m doing and if everything is okay but i don t have an answer because i genuinely don t know how i feel no one can help because i don t know what s wrong with me either this is a repetitive cycle that continues on and on i don t even know what to do i just want to sob so hard that i can t breathe my head pounds where i shake my nose is a faucet and i have to gasp for air over and over again sadly when i go through that it makes me feel alive that i m still here that i m not in a constant loop of life and that i can feel emotions other than numbness i don t want to watch a tv show or read a book that makes me sad because sure that can work but then i ll overthink that book or movie and that would be a constant loop in my head i've been there done that i m trying therapy again but it s been a while since the last time due to financials i m unsure why i m writing this other than asking how i do not feel like this how do i get rid of the numbness no cliche answers of go outside exercise or spend time with loved ones my loved ones are also depressed and i can t help them if i m like this i m the one who helps others when they re down but i can t do that because i m giving up paddling the water below me i m drowning i m tired of feeling like this or having this be so reoccurring i m tired i m exhausted i m tired of paddling i apologize for my long winded rant i just needed to put something out there that wasn t in my journal or notes app,-0.042077020202020206,-0.9904,NEGATIVE,0.998127281665802,neutral,negative,negative

mentalhealth,1j37ddn,Feeling a bit frustrated about my cousin's perspective on mental health medication,"So my cousin has been struggling with her mental health and depression and anxiety for years, ever since her mum died. She was advised many times to go on medication and she didn't want to. She has reached the point of having really bad thoughts. 

  
Recently, she's had to come live with me and my mum in order to cope better and so we could help. She agreed to go to the doctor after a big panic attack she had and finally agreed to start treatment for depression (under her doctor's supervision). After having blood work done and they told her she has hypothyroidism. They said that one of the effects of it is low mood. 

  
Today, I was talking to her about whether the meds for depression are working for her, and she told me she isn't feeling anything yet (it's only been 2 weeks). However, she mentioned that if she goes back to the doctor and they give her treatment for hypothyroidism, she'd much rather follow that treatment and hope that the depression goes fully away just like that.

  
I asked her why and she said I'd much rather take meds for something like hypothyroidism than depression. 

  
I was kind of upset to hear that. I can't believe the level of stigma people still have with mental health meds. I tried to reason it out with her and told her she should follow the doctor and psychiatrist's advice and that both are conditions that are equally deserving of treatment.

mentalhealth,mtoyxw,Two weeks ago I was almost homeless. Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot,"I think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times, and I shared here previously when I thought I was at one of the direst moments of my life.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.

So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too. Is a bit cheesy, but in the end, hope is sometimes all that we have left, and guts to keep on fighting wherever way you can.",536,22,i think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times and i shared here previously when i thought i was at one of the direst moments of my life it has been two weeks i was basically out of money in a new city have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any so i decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway shared with the staff my story and how i was going to be homeless that same day but since it is a small city the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction although i'm male she decided to give me a chance and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far i actually like the job a lot and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week my anxiety and depression are way under control now it seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while i still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months years so that is it just sharing a story with a better ending than i expected so that maybe it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too is a bit cheesy but in the end hope is sometimes all that we have left and guts to keep on fighting wherever way you can,0.06851010101010102,0.996,NEGATIVE,0.8313827514648438,positive,positive,negative

mentalhealth,1jgy0dx,Healthy Diet is Affecting My Mental Health?,"Hello, I (34M) recently decided that I needed to start working on being healthier and lose some weight. Based on professional Medical assessments I need to lose almost 200 pounds. 

I also have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. 

Personally I love to cook and try new recipes I love to make and eat super delicious food. I love cooking so much that I make 90% of the meals for my household.

Now I may be totally off base here, but I think a big part of my overeating problem stems from the dopamine I get from eating tasty food. Once I really started tracking what I've been eating I noticed I used to eat/snack almost constantly. Now I am trying really hard to reduce my calorie intake because I have almost no time for exercise so the entire calorie deficit has to be diet based. So that means I eat less tasty food, less frequently, and in lower amounts. Which so far does seem to be helping me shed some weight. (13 pounds in 3 weeks) 

But my side affect is that I feel like I'm spiraling. Even on great days I feel so down. I have seen/heard that ADHD can cause problems with our dopamine reception. Maybe that's totally wrong and if so please correct me. But it seems like I just can't seem to stop spiraling ever since I started eating less. I feel like I have to lose the weight because it's dangerous to my health to be so heavy, but I also feel like if I can't stop this spiral it will also be dangerous. So friends what do I do now? Any tips or tricks that you may have found to help?

mentalhealth,1k70i9q,Am I allowed to be mad/upset at my sister who is currently struggling with mental health?,"I (26F) have a sister (24F) “A” who works a mentally demanding job as a case manager at our city’s women’s homeless shelter. 
She works long hours Mon-Fri and is such a kind and giving person and I can tell she works herself to the bone.  
This issue is this (and this may make me sound like an A-hole) but she has become incredibly flaky the past 2-3 years and it makes it impossible to do anything with her. 
Back in 2022 we (me and her and our other four sisters) had planned a trip to Mexico for my birthday the following year (2023)  and she was heavily involved in the decision making of where to go and the cost. 
However a few weeks before going she confessed she never got her passport and finances were tight and she couldn’t go (at this point it had been a year since we had originally planned the trip - plenty of time to save and get a passport) 
We told her we didn’t mind paying for her. 
Then in early 2024 we all got tickets to Taylor Swift  later that year and once again she was heavily involved in all the plans from day one. She requested a ticket, she planned hotels with us and travel arrangements. 
Then a few weeks before she confessed she still didn’t get her passport or flights and wouldn’t be able to go. 
We didn’t mind helping her financially but we couldn’t force her to get the needed passport. 

This year we planned a trip to our local national park as a celebration for her engagement. We had been planning this trip since December of last year. 
Since this was for her engagement we had made it very clear that in no way was she expected to pay for anything. It was our treat. 
The trip was planned for sat/sun. 
My older sister made us all matching shirts to celebrate 
The Tuesday before we were to leave she texted the group chat and said she couldn’t go due to financial reasons. 
We reminded her that she didn’t need to pay for anything but she still insisted she couldn’t afford it. 
Me and the other sisters talked and decided maybe she’d go if we just did a day trip (we only live a couple hours away from the national park) 
That way she wouldn’t feel guilty about hotel costs or anything. 
We brought up the idea to her and she agreed. 
Then that Friday (day before we leave) she said she couldn’t go. 
This was so frustrating because the whole point of the trip was to celebrate her and then we canceled the hotel and changed everything again to make her happy and she still insisted she couldn’t go. 

These are just the major things she has flaked on. Over the past couple years she has continually canceled on dinners, movie nights at home, walks in the park, drinks etc. 
she has even canceled on events she has invited us to. 

I also struggle with depression and anxiety and while I’m not trying to compare myself to her it just is starting to feel like a cope out. 
I’m also frustrated because my sister “A” is also a frequent user of edibles and I know she pays a ton for those (she has told me how much they cost) so if it’s financially that is preventing her from doing something I don’t know why she just doesn’t stop spending all her money on that. 

I don’t feel like I’m allowed to be upset at her but I’m mostly upset because I love her and want to spend time with her. I’d pay for her to go on every trip if needed  but she will not allow it. 
I have also spoken with “A” on multiple occasions about seeking mental health support and she always insist she’s fine. 

Am I allowed or should I be more understanding?

mentalhealth,1keshqw,"A Huge Thank You to My Mental Health Nurse, Who Helped Me Climb Out of the Dark","Hey everyone, I wanted to share my story of struggling with depression and how a mental health professional, Tshaun Grant, played a crucial role in my recovery. I'm posting this not only to express my deep gratitude but also in the hope that it might offer some comfort or encouragement to someone else going through a tough time.

For the past couple of years, I've been working in a pretty demanding job. The pressure, long hours, and constant stress started to take a serious toll on my mental health. I began experiencing persistent sadness, loss of interest in things I used to enjoy, fatigue, and overwhelming anxiety. I initially brushed it off as just being ""stressed,"" but it gradually worsened to the point where it was affecting my ability to function, both at work and in my personal life. I felt trapped, hopeless, and completely drained.

I finally realized I needed help, and that's when I found Tshaun Grant. From our very first appointment, I felt heard and understood. Tshaun didn't dismiss my feelings or tell me to ""just get over it."" Instead, she validated my experience, helped me understand the connection between my work environment and my depression, and worked with me to develop a personalized treatment plan.

Tshaun's approach was incredibly supportive and collaborative. She combined therapy (which helped me develop coping mechanisms and reframe negative thought patterns) with, and I want to be careful here to follow the group rules, so I will say, other treatment options. She also provided me with practical tools for managing stress, improving my sleep, and incorporating self-care into my daily routine, something I had completely neglected.

It wasn't an overnight fix, of course. There were ups and downs, setbacks and moments of doubt. But Tshaun was there every step of the way, providing consistent support, encouragement, and guidance. She empowered me to take an active role in my recovery and helped me build resilience.

Over time, with Tshaun's help, I started to feel like myself again. The darkness began to lift, and I was able to regain my energy, motivation, and sense of hope. I learned to set healthy boundaries at work, prioritize my well-being, and communicate my needs effectively. I'm now in a much better place, both mentally and emotionally.

I know that everyone's experience with depression is different, and what worked for me might not work for everyone. But I want to emphasize that help is available, and recovery is possible. If you're struggling, please don't suffer in silence. Reach out to a mental health professional. Finding the right person can make all the difference.

I'm eternally grateful to Tshaun Grant for her expertise, compassion, and unwavering support. She helped me find my way back to the light, and I'll never forget her kindness. Thank you, Tshaun, for giving me my life back.

mentalhealth,1kd7m5i,"Do mood trackers, mental health apps or bots actually help you cope with depression, anxiety, or burnout?","Hi everyone,  
I'm not a therapist — just someone going through a long and messy healing process. Lately, I’ve been building a Telegram-based tool for myself: it helps me track my mood, do short self-care practices, write down my thoughts.

I'm not a fan of journaling by hand, but my therapist gives me homework — so I started putting it into the bot to make it easier to follow.

I'm curious:

* Have you ever used apps like this?
* Did they actually help you feel supported — even a little?
* Or did you try and feel they weren’t for you?
* Do you have a favorite feature or app that really made a difference?
* Maybe you’ve seen any on this topic?

Any thoughts would be appreciated. My goal is to make something that *genuinely* helps — especially in those moments when there’s no one else around to talk to.

mentalhealth,1k2o7zp,What happens to my mental health if I take expired medicines?,"https://preview.redd.it/h4nsa7vjzpve1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6769c4c8a6ad32f931361d35c95c0816883a7a85

Taking expired medication can have different effects on your mental health, depending on the type of medicine, how long it's been expired, and how your body reacts. Here’s what can happen:

1. **Reduced Effectiveness:** Many mental health meds (like antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, or mood stabilizers) lose potency after expiration. This can lead to a return or worsening of symptoms—like increased anxiety, depression, or mood swings.
2. **Unpredictable Side Effects:** Although rare, some expired medications can chemically change and cause unexpected reactions or side effects that could mess with your mental state or physical health.
3. **Disrupted Treatment:** Taking an ineffective or altered dose can throw off your mental health routine, making you feel confused, unstable, or even hopeless if symptoms return.
4. **Increased Anxiety or Guilt:** Just *knowing* you took something expired might increase stress or anxiety—especially if you’re already feeling mentally vulnerable.

If you've taken expired meds, don’t panic—most aren’t dangerous, just less effective. But you should call your doctor or pharmacist, especially if you notice any new symptoms. And try to replace old meds regularly—it’s part of taking care of yourself 💊🧠✨",1,1,taking expired medication can have different effects on your mental health depending on the type of medicine how long it's been expired and how your body reacts here s what can happen reduced effectiveness many mental health meds like antidepressants anti anxiety meds or mood stabilizers lose potency after expiration this can lead to a return or worsening of symptoms like increased anxiety depression or mood swings unpredictable side effects although rare some expired medications can chemically change and cause unexpected reactions or side effects that could mess with your mental state or physical health disrupted treatment taking an ineffective or altered dose can throw off your mental health routine making you feel confused unstable or even hopeless if symptoms return increased anxiety or guilt just knowing you took something expired might increase stress or anxiety especially if you re already feeling mentally vulnerable if you've taken expired meds don t panic most aren t dangerous just less effective but you should call your doctor or pharmacist especially if you notice any new symptoms and try to replace old meds regularly it s part of taking care of yourself,-0.009650856389986827,-0.8012,NEGATIVE,0.9992448091506958,neutral,negative,negative

mentalhealth,1k6ixty,Psychiatrist diagnosed me with multiple disorders because of constant exposure to someone with mental health issues?,"After my partner infidelity, I went to therapist. In my first session, the therapist suggested that my primary issue was needing someone to talk to and experiencing stress due to the effort of trying to 'make my ex with BPD happy'. I didn't fully agree with this initial assessment because, even when I had someone to confide in, I continued to struggle with significant anxiety, unpredictable anger, persistent feelings of worthlessness, and other symptoms.

My situation was assessed further, leading to a preliminary indication of PTSD after I involved my parent, sibling, and childhood best friend for support during my therapy sessions. Subsequently, the therapist referred me to a psychiatrist for a more comprehensive evaluation. There, I underwent further psychological testing, completing three assessments, the MMPI, PAI, and MCMI.

Based on this thorough evaluation process, I was diagnosed with multiple conditions, Autism Spectrum, noted as likely having a genetic component. Acute depression, and PTSD. It was explained that the latter two diagnoses (depression and PTSD) were likely exacerbated by prolonged and constant exposure to individuals with significant mental health challenges.

To provide context regarding this exposure, one of my close friends has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, although their condition didn't seem to directly impact my own mental health in the same way. My mother exhibits some traits consistent with NPD, though these behaviors were rarely directed towards me, mostly towards my father. My father displays characteristics suggestive of adult autism.

Furthermore, my three former fiancées (yes, three – I acknowledge this likely reflects relationship patterns modeled after my parents) respectively showed traits suggestive of HPD, NPD, and the last one was formally diagnosed with BPD. All of them came from backgrounds with challenging family dynamics, and all were unfaithful in our relationship.

mentalhealth,1jjuixi,The questionings of a 23 mental health  Boi,"I AM SO SO SORRY THIS IS VERY LONG, THANK YOU SO MUCH IF YOU DECIDE TO READ AND OFFER EXPERIENCES OR ADVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have schizophrenic tendencies, including Paranoia, Mood swings, Sometimes i hear things (I have never been told or held convos with what i hear), along with PTSD and General depressive disorder and ADHD.  I just recently moved and i ran out of my 3 month supply of meds, and i have been removed from my last clinic due to the length of time i wasn't going (they only hold info for like 3 months) and both  my psychiatrist and therapist both left and i have no contact with them and am struggling to find providers near me.

Its been about 6 months since i have had my Vraylar (depressions, anti psychotic med) and i have resorted to using my Atomexetine (adhd med) to help me wake up on important days, not wanting to run through the few pills i have left. I think that i made ALOT of progress with my Providers in the time i was with them (roughly a year and a half)  and i have a amazing support system in my gf and my friends and family. I know i have my issues, and i have been practicing more mental changes and word altering practices to help me deal with my chaotic thoughts, my mood swings are another story, but have been able to not snap or become angry in a pretty long time, and when it happens i am quick to notice and catch myself before doing so.

That being said, I have been struggling a bit with my day to day life, i cant go to sleep, cant wake up, always brain fogged and groggy, monotone voice, generic numb feeling and lack of motivation, and falling back on using vapes and smoking weed more than i was/ wanting to realistically. Like i said, with the help of my Dr's and my support, i have found ways to deal with my issues and outburst. But now that i am off of my meds and have been for a while, and probably my watching of too many youtubers gone wrong, i am worried about myself in terms of my ability to function and have broken it down in 3 ways

1. I'm on the verge of or exiting a manic episode, i was doing so good for a while, hobbies, getting to work on time, no excessive drinking or smoking. Because of this, i am noticing my patterns and am about to go 100mph or im about to slam on the brakes even harder than i feel

2. i am okay, i have been using my breathing, anxiety and my negative thought excerices to help me manage myself. I only have bad flair ups when i am smoking before i need to do something and get anxious and paranoid, and i simply just need to dial it back and keep doing what i am doing and stop overthinking it all so  much, and continue to communicate and address concerns i have with my support system. Mental Illness is a forever diagnosis, and it will have its ups and downs and this is just a bumpy part

3. My mental health is getting worse,  i AM moving closer to possibly developing full blown scitzophrenia and thats my thoughts have been feeling strange/ altered at times. My paranoia and over stimulations from my smoking (i don't have these same ""delusions"" when i drink) are possible signs of a impending psychosis crack or something.

mentalhealth,1jy3oti,Friend with mental health issues makes my own journey to recovery hard,"I am struggling with depression and social anxiety and have been for a while. It's hard, but I'm at least somewhat handling it. I have a friend I've known for a long time now. We're VERY different people, but she also struggles with her mental health. She drinks and does self harm to manage her pain, and I feel like it's hard to help her. It's especially hard because I have enough with myself. But because she's ""worse""/struggling more, I prioritise listening to her and feel bad for her instead of focusing on myself. I'm constantly worried she'll commit suicide, she's very unstable and has a hard time with the professional help she's getting.
Today she told me that she had arranged lunch for us, a friend of ours and her mother. She didn't ask me beforehand, and when I said I had been socialising yesterday and didn't feel up to it, she kept pressing. She guilt tripped me and even offered me some of her prescribed medication for anxiety (I don't take anything myself and she knows that). Which I feel is waaaaay over the line. She had never struggled with social anxiety and it doesn't feel like she's trying to understand or respect it when I said no.

Basically I feel like our friendship makes me feel worse because I worry more for her than I spend time caring for myself. But if I tell her how I feel, that I need space, I think she would hurt herself even more, or worse, and that's the last thing I want. I don't want to lose my friend, I just need some space.
Any advice? I'm desperate.

mentalhealth,1josuvl,What is Mental health?,"Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and behave, as well as how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Just like physical health, mental health is something we all have, and it can fluctuate depending on life circumstances, stress, and other factors.

Good mental health doesn’t mean feeling happy all the time it’s about being able to cope with life’s challenges, maintain relationships, and function in daily life. Mental health issues, like anxiety, depression, or stress, are common and nothing to be ashamed of. Seeking help, whether through therapy, support systems, or self-care, is a crucial part of maintaining well-being.

mentalhealth,1jwa0j9,Aus - GP refused medical certificate for mental health,"Hi, TL;DR - looking for a sense check and advice on what to do with regards to taking some time off work for mental health following GP telling me ‘no medical certificate until ‘paper trail’ despite a paper trail since 2024. Aus specific - background for context. 

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for over a decade, generally in check, know my triggers, talking therapy helps along with implementing the skills learnt in therapy. Mid last year I had a number of stressors including work and body dysphoria. I spoke with my manager about the work stress on a number of occasions and that I was at capacity - I was still asked to do more. stressors m and triggers started to pop up - on a wait list for a psyc and booked into the GP for a referral. It was a new GP but at the same family clinic I go to (has access to all my records including previous psyc referrals etc). 

I’ve seen the GP 3 times since sept. (initial app. Referral and anti depressants, a check in and a third a couple of weeks ago as a check in and updated referral) on each occasion we’ve talked about my progress. I’ve seen the psyc regularly since November ‘24 ( the first appointment I could get) on a weekly basis until December and then fortnightly since then. The psyc has sent update letters to the GP. 

I haven’t taken any sick leave because of a lack of job security and fear that this would impact my chances of securing something longer term (I know it shouldn’t - but that doesn’t mean that it won’t). I’ve held off and taken other types of leave where I’ve needed it to get me through. I have just secured a new job in a new team and finally feel a light at the end of the tunnel re job stressors and other stressors because getting through the job stress has meant less time to unpack the underlying drivers re body dysphoria with psyc. 

This week I asked the GP if I could have some time off work with med. certificate for my mental health until I start my new role; I booked the 1st available appointment I could get (Telehealth); knowing that id probably need to go in person for a check in, also booked the 1st available in person appointment for 2 weeks time. 

Initially the GP said “you haven’t come to see me in person and I haven’t even done the DASS with you” (we’ve done it on two occasions for referrals), I tried to point out we had, then I was told “I can’t write a med. cert. if you don’t engage and actually come and see me in person” I explained this was the first app. etc, and I have app. in person in 2 weeks. 

Then: “I need a paper trail, your psyc needs to write me a letter and you need a treatment plan, I won’t just tick and flick this” I was at a loss about the last 6 months, if not a ‘treatment plan’. I explained I had been seeing the psyc regularly, the antidepressants, the GP check ins with her and that I would mention this letter to my psyc next week. The GP got annoyed: ‘you don’t get to ask the psyc for a letter I do, you’re not the case manager, I am and you don’t get to tell me what your treatment is, I tell you what the treatment is and I won’t just write you a medical certificate, this needs proper treatment and a paper trail’. I got upset with this response, explaining I don’t understand what else she needs me to do for ‘paper trail’. She told me that me getting upset was “part of my condition”. Left it that GP would contact psyc, no med. certificate. Want a sense check on whether this is a normal response from a GP or should I get second opinion?

I have only recently discovored that my parents overall treatment of me was abusive (mostly mental and emotional abuse) and my mom has slowed that down after my parents divorce, but my dad has gotten worse, yelling, subdle insults constantly. which is why im writing here.

i'll start with things i almost certainly have ADHD (not diagnosed), Depression (not diagnosed),Social Anxiety (not diagnosed). these things i belive i have very strongly because they affect my daily life almost constantly. these are the things my parents have pointed out and didn't care to have me see a therapist about.

The image is of a test i took that i mentioned earlier and the tests match i see and hear things others don't, im constantly paranoid, i have a hard time feeling certain emotions, i have mood swings, sometimes i have a hard time feeling empathy, i almost always feel inadequite and when i connect to someone i become dessperatly attached to them.

I just don't know anymore im 16 my dad won't let me get a job, my parents are completely uncaring of my need for help, my mom always says ""oh, why didn't your father do this or that  you needed?"" but never does it herself, and she only acts diffrent when im around, she acts the same when she belives i won't see or notice. i don't know what to do.

mentalhealth,1ju3tn8,Opinions/thoughts: my teen who is struggling with mental health,"Hi all, 
I’m a single mom with a 17 yo who has depression, ADHD-inattentive type, extreme anxiety, and possible BPD (too young to say, but strongly suspect). 
They were ghosted by a friend a year ago, and because of it, the last 4 months they have been crying so hard at night that their whole body convulsively trembles and shakes—almost every night. Constant ruminating about what they did wrong in the relationship. I console, talk through it, but it starts back up the next day like it’s Ground Hog Day. 
I brought them to a Kaiser program that was DBT-based, but it was really poorly organized and led and kids there were telling my kid things like  “here’s cool ways to kill yourself” which really upset my kid (many coming off the psych ward). 
We quit after 6 weeks. 
We’ve tried individual therapy, but just haven’t found the right clinician. My kid has tried Wellbutrin, metadate, Lexapro, and others that I can’t remember the names of. None have proven effective. 
Ideally I would find a DBT group, but it’s been a challenge as well—either the facility isn’t accessible (my kid uses a wheelchair), only for kids who have made an attempt on their life, or only for kids over 18. I feel like I’m striking out everywhere. I just want to get some relief for my kid who is struggling and in pain, but it’s such an uphill battle.

Then someone suggested the outpatient program at Newport Academy, but after reading a lot about it, there’s no way. If you’ve personal experience with it, I’m all ears.

mentalhealth,1jqvucf,Meds that are supposed to help my mental health aren’t working.,"TW: Medical, Anxiety/Depression

I started getting help for my mental health around January of this year. After struggling with debilitating depression and anxiety for 6 years now and having no support in college, I made an appointment with my PCP got prescribed Lexapro.
I took 5 mg for the first few days, and it just felt off, but as soon as I started taking10 mg, everything got so much worse. I was skipping lectures, sleeping for most of the day and all night, not eating, and, worse of all, my suicidal thoughts got worse. I thought this was normal, until it got so bad that I was crying myself to sleep and failing all my classes. I called my PCP and was told to immediately stop the medication and take a leave of absence from school.

I then enrolled in a partial hospitalization program to get CBT and have a medical team that can prescribe me the right meds. As soon as I got there, the psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was on it for two weeks, and it felt like it gave me too much energy. I knew it would mellow out, but last week, I started getting motor and vocal tics. After an hour, it started getting worse and at that point, I drove myself to the ED (can’t afford an ambulance) and was immediately admitted. After I got a shot to stop the tics, I was told to immediately stop taking the Wellbutrin and to go home a rest. The next day, I thought everything would be fine, until I started getting the tics again, so I went to the ED again, this time with my parents. I was told that the Wellbutrin was still in my system and it’ll take some time to get it all out. (This was perfect just before my 19th birthday…) It’s been a week now, and I’m still getting tics, though it’s less intense (I’m taking the oral version of the antidote to take care of it now). But now, Wellbutrin is listed on my medical chart as an allergy.

Now, after all this happened, the nurse practitioner thought that the tics could have been caused by anxiety, so she prescribed me Gabapentin yesterday. I took it last night and then started feeling a bit itchy, but I just chalked that up to be dry skin. Around 11 PM last night, my skin started to get itchier and itchier and, you guessed it, I got tics again. I took the medication that the ED doctor prescribed me and tried to sleep off the itchiness, but I just couldn’t. Everything was SOOOO itchy. At this point, I just wanted to peel my skin off, but I obviously can’t do that, so what do I do? I take a shower in the middle of the night…
Even after I take the shower, I’m still itchy and at this point, am bawling my eyes out because 1. I’m so so tired from taking both the Gabapentin AND the medication for my tics and, 2. I was feeling super hopeless that there was a way for me to be medicated without going to the ED or making my mental health worse. 

So, Gabapentin is now listed as another one of my allergies. Today, I’m spending time at home, still itchy, just trying to figure out why all of this is happening to me and if it’s actually worth all the trouble to fix my mental health problems.

TL;DR: Medications that I’m taking that are supposed to help my mental health aren’t working and I’m having an existential crisis over whether or not it’s a good idea to continue looking for a medication that works. I don’t need advice, I just wanna vent 😕.",1,0,tw medical anxiety depression i started getting help for my mental health around january of this year after struggling with debilitating depression and anxiety for years now and having no support in college i made an appointment with my pcp got prescribed lexapro i took mg for the first few days and it just felt off but as soon as i started taking mg everything got so much worse i was skipping lectures sleeping for most of the day and all night not eating and worse of all my suicidal thoughts got worse i thought this was normal until it got so bad that i was crying myself to sleep and failing all my classes i called my pcp and was told to immediately stop the medication and take a leave of absence from school i then enrolled in a partial hospitalization program to get cbt and have a medical team that can prescribe me the right meds as soon as i got there the psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin i was on it for two weeks and it felt like it gave me too much energy i knew it would mellow out but last week i started getting motor and vocal tics after an hour it started getting worse and at that point i drove myself to the ed can t afford an ambulance and was immediately admitted after i got a shot to stop the tics i was told to immediately stop taking the wellbutrin and to go home a rest the next day i thought everything would be fine until i started getting the tics again so i went to the ed again this time with my parents i was told that the wellbutrin was still in my system and it ll take some time to get it all out this was perfect just before my th birthday it s been a week now and i m still getting tics though it s less intense i m taking the oral version of the antidote to take care of it now but now wellbutrin is listed on my medical chart as an allergy now after all this happened the nurse practitioner thought that the tics could have been caused by anxiety so she prescribed me gabapentin yesterday i took it last night and then started feeling a bit itchy but i just chalked that up to be dry skin around pm last night my skin started to get itchier and itchier and you guessed it i got tics again i took the medication that the ed doctor prescribed me and tried to sleep off the itchiness but i just couldn t everything was soooo itchy at this point i just wanted to peel my skin off but i obviously can t do that so what do i do i take a shower in the middle of the night even after i take the shower i m still itchy and at this point am bawling my eyes out because i m so so tired from taking both the gabapentin and the medication for my tics and i was feeling super hopeless that there was a way for me to be medicated without going to the ed or making my mental health worse so gabapentin is now listed as another one of my allergies today i m spending time at home still itchy just trying to figure out why all of this is happening to me and if it s actually worth all the trouble to fix my mental health problems tl dr medications that i m taking that are supposed to help my mental health aren t working and i m having an existential crisis over whether or not it s a good idea to continue looking for a medication that works i don t need advice i just wanna vent,-0.002897869674185468,-0.9968,NEGATIVE,0.9994864463806152,neutral,negative,negative
mentalhealth,1jfpwdy,My mental health is collapsing due to my parents marriage,"Hi. I am a 24 year old man with anxiety and depression, who doesn’t have any close friends and is co-dependant on his parents. In 2011, my parents would have huge fights on the daily, and I recently found out (don’t ask me how) that this was due to my father cheating on my mother, but neither of my parents know I found out. Fast forward to 2025, and my mother has been going through a depressive episode, seeing a therapist every week, overwhelmed with work and no longer talks to my father. She was recently discussing whether or not she wants to fire the receptionist at our family business, and she wrote (in our family group chat) “she made a mistake, but it’s not a big deal. People make mistakes in their health, career and marriage every day, despite knowing how bad these mistakes are” which is a clear slight against my father for cheating all those years ago. The other day, she also returned home and cried after work but refused to tell us why when we asked. I want to support her, but I have crippling anxiety and depression, and the collapse of my parent’s marriage is ruining my life. What should I do?",2,1,hi i am a year old man with anxiety and depression who doesn t have any close friends and is co dependant on his parents in my parents would have huge fights on the daily and i recently found out don t ask me how that this was due to my father cheating on my mother but neither of my parents know i found out fast forward to and my mother has been going through a depressive episode seeing a therapist every week overwhelmed with work and no longer talks to my father she was recently discussing whether or not she wants to fire the receptionist at our family business and she wrote in our family group chat she made a mistake but it s not a big deal people make mistakes in their health career and marriage every day despite knowing how bad these mistakes are which is a clear slight against my father for cheating all those years ago the other day she also returned home and cried after work but refused to tell us why when we asked i want to support her but i have crippling anxiety and depression and the collapse of my parent s marriage is ruining my life what should i do,-0.00897435897435897,-0.9878,NEGATIVE,0.9991770386695862,neutral,negative,negative
