0,0_mental health_mental illness_depression_depressed,1,i relate to this super hard i haven t seen any friends for a few months and only talking to them through text i feel like i m misreading everything they say and don t say some of my friends are barely responding to me when i try to reach out to them and i can t tell if it s because they don t have the energy to talk or if it s because they just don t want to talk to me personally so i can t tell if i should reach out more or less and when i get asked how i m doing i don t feel like i can be honest because i don t want to bum anyone out and because i don t feel like i have the right to complain also because i feel lonelier and more alienated from people every day the longer i don t see anyone and don t even see the point of trying to articulate how confused sad and scared this whole thing is making me because i don t know how to put it into words and the people who do ask me make me feel like i m overreacting when i try to tell them anyways pretty crappy year to try to overcome anxiety other mental health issues and work on having better relationships i even feel whiny typing this out here but yeah you re not alone p
0,0_mental health_mental illness_depression_depressed,2,it sucks you feel that way about life bro because life has alot of cool and beautiful shit in it but i feel like you do have mental health issues if you didn t you would feel this way don t let mental health take you out of this game called life brother don t let that be the way people see you i don t know what s it s like to go through the things you have i don t have mental health problems i don t have family problems i don t have friend problems i ve had a pretty easy life ya maybe it s a bit pathetic still living with your parents at the age of but i try not to look at it in that light i don t like being the guy to say this but think of it like this what about the tribes in africa that have to scavenge for food so they don t starve they don t have any modern conveniences or resources yet they find a way to smile and enjoy life i m telling you bro it s the shit in your head making you feel like this way you need a vacation somewhere where you can find that release but without the dieng part i wouldn t know where to begin to tell you where that is maybe a comicon or some public festival like that you said you like anime maybe a local comic shop that caters to that genre i was lost recently in life as well didn t know where i wanted to go didn t know what i want to do just generally was stuck in the mud i was also an atheist for about years i was an atheist i left christianity with a bad taste in my mouth i hope someone nails me on that joke all puns intended i know you can take me out back and shoot me later i found heathenry about may of last year it was and still and seems to be what i was looking for the community the faith the way it made me feel i had found my passion again if you haven t been told before look into heathenry it s the faith of the norse and viking people if you didn t know and you dont need to practice the faith if you don t want cuz of your current religious affiliations but the values they hold and the aspect they look at life at is to me motivating it gets me out of bed and ready for the upcoming day it gets me through times of stress and times of strife you mentioned you like learning odin is the norse equivalent to zeus he is the father of all gods anyways not tryin to preach to ya just giving you a little background odin is also the god of knowledge and the stellar example of what the norse people beloved a man should be smart cunning loving stern courageous deliberate loyal strong and most important to me humble i urge you to hang in there dude life isn t all that bad i understand you have bad luck but life is what you make it also those people you talk about aren t your friends even the ones you like if they were real friends whether they re your best friend or not they wouldn t care who they re around when they talk to you the heathen community is very strong minded even if you re not interested in it go find a heathen and talk to them get to know them they ll be some of the most genuine people you ll ever meet hope you find the release you need without the death part bro from texas with love peace homie
0,0_mental health_mental illness_depression_depressed,3,i ve dealt with suicidal thought for the better part of my life i reached a point where i truly felt as though i lost everything turned not long ago mental health suffering tied into this unnatural emotional attachment to someone drinking life critical volumes of alcohol and eventually turned to hard drugs i wanted to die i spent days figuring it out went on the prominent forums seeking information and advice i m a felon so a gun was difficult to obtain i woke up one day few hours of sleep like usual coming down off all the hard shit i was doing and just lost the desire i began thinking of how much i wanted to tell someone in particular i was doing it how every other method of suicide was subject to failure and if i did this i d possibly be found thought about eventually getting a gun sending them a message of it and that this is the end take care and i m sorry for everything how much i actually cared for this person and honestly regretted everything i said and did because they weren t responsible for why i was doing this i just had too many issues and transposed on them i was so ashamed of everything i had done how i made them feel and how i truly wanted them to be happy i never meant to do all the things i did and hurt them because i was hurt and unable to cope with unreciprocated feelings i didn t want to die an immature homeless junkie i didn t want to put that on anyone ever i m not religious and have little belief in anything other than complete nothingness post death i ve never feared death only failure but it wasn t my place to do this not to a young girl i irrationally fixated on and developed irrational emotion for it wasn t her fault it was mine even if there s nothing but dark nothingness after it s all over no concern or worry i refused to affect a living being because of my unbearable desire to not be around i d rather suffer every day of every minute than die knowing this is my legacy and how i affected the world because of my misery of course i still want to die in the back of my mind i don t know how to cope with this loss and i can t just turn around from the lowest point in my life and expect to make something of life i have to face this misery and knowing i may never realize the life i truly desired for the end of my days i don t know how many days i ll feel like actually not wanting to exist but i owe it to myself and to others to try and make something of it i can t die like this i can t die in all this regret and knowing i never gave it my best and let everyone down as much as i want to cease the conscious self that continues to torment me with every single damn regret and mistake i ve ever fucking made as much as i want to paint the wall with all of those stupid choices i made in spite of the opportunity and chances provided to me i can t do it it s not time not yet i don t know what there is but if i found reason in the deepest depths of drug fueled misery and complete emotional volatility beyond understanding i gotta find out what the hell happened and why i didn t go through with it if i have to live my life in misery for the sake of others and in the shadow of the mistakes i ve made so be it i can deal with my own misery i can hold my hand to the flame until there s nothing but bone but i can t deal with the thought of others in misery because of my own i only hope that in time things will change and true desire to live will come to be if not i accept that i accept my mistakes and will do my best to make something of life until it s time to go i only hope that if i have to endure not much more than life of misery and regret those who i care about will realize the best of everything they can and impact the world in a positive way when my time does come i hope it s fair enough and i ll feel everything is okay enough to leave nothingness is fine one life is more than enough to experience
1,1_news_politics_political_unrest,1,good turn it off it s toxic idk why people are so caught up in it the most miserable people as an aggregate seem to be people who obsess over politics and news there s a reason the saying is if it bleeds it leads news isn t designed to keep you informed it s designed to invoke emotion that keeps you watching i watched news for the st time in years because i was sitting with my parent of the hour block they spent minutes talking about something that didn t have to do with ww or killing and it was remembering someone who died and it was literally at the end of the program
1,1_news_politics_political_unrest,2,me too for weeks i have not been able to do anything i enjoy i ve skipped yoga for weeks i haven t been able to read or write i ve gotten in trouble at work for checking out i have been sleeping more and spending more time not being sober during the day i wake up check the news and stay on the news all day check the polls my mental health is so much worse because of this election i am scared this election has real life implications for myself and a number of my close friends and so many people that i do not know but worry about because i have empathy for others i am trying to stay away from the news now but it s so hard i just need to know how this ends you know it s exactly like reading a suspenseful book but not being able to read the end my mind is going ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and has not stopped it probably will not stop especially if mr mega orange doofus dumbshit is reelected i m sorry i wish i had more advice just know you re not alone there are people who do not believe what others believe who care about the future of this country and this world who are struggling like you i am sending love and peace
1,1_news_politics_political_unrest,3,us news is designed to be divisive if it was unified it could be used as a propaganda piece for the government it also would be less profitable since news today is tailored to their audience people watch news they want to hear not what they need to for example if you are on the left you want to hear donald trump is going to jail or kamala will will win election easily they tailor and sell you that news you buy it it ends up being untrue you get angry and start to question so called media anxiety builds because you don t know what is going on then that same media tries to instill fear to keep you watching the best thing i ve done is put it down for a second especially corporate media these are literally arms of each political party realize there are at least two sides thank goodness of the isle and if you are watching only one side understand you are risking being manipulated however if you are able to understand both sides and engage you might see through some of the bs and are less likely to be blindsided i have found you can do this by watching independent media in which the other side is invited on for debate in this way you can still be informed but watch both sides duke it out civilly and on the record then you decide and ultimately vote during our election cycles as for your anxiety turn it off completely for a while i have found ultimately politics has no impact on my life whatsoever other than people getting riled up over it regardless of our political beliefs i have found i have more in common with other americans than differences respecting those differences on a foundation of commonality is critical not everyone will agree with you but that s ok but if you choose to engage it can be healthy if we know how to talk to one another share ideas agree to disagree know when to walk away from topics that are too hot or when to just hug it out and just be cool again no need to be rude or upset sometimes you may have to say sorry or forgive others but it is worth it to build your character this takes time and practice and getting to know others that you may not totally agree with but does not mean you can t like them learn from them and get to know more about yourself heck you may even learn to like yourself and start to love others if you are able to navigate through all that successfully that is the ultimate unification best of luck to you
2,2_social media_facebook_instagram_twitter,1,absolutely i deleted all my social media apps besides reddit i m feeling a lot better after doing this i m straight up addicted to social media i find myself going to my social media folder on my phone non stop during the day i m trying to figure out something else to fill the time that i spent on social media
2,2_social media_facebook_instagram_twitter,2,social media is toxic i don t mind reddit to an extent but all social media is toxic
2,2_social media_facebook_instagram_twitter,3,i deleted instagram bc i noticed the effect it had on my health i thought it was because i was seeing the lives of ppl i knew then i tried tiktok for a few weeks and realised it made me feel even worse than the few years i had instagram for i still use some social media but it s much more limited at least time wise i have snapchat purely for one group chat with my housemates i use whatsapp to talk to family i use discord reddit pinterest and tumblr because the atmosphere is different and it s more of a way for me to engage with my actual interests social media doesn t have to be bad but we need to recognise what makes it unhealthy for us and when it is i wish i had deleted instagram earlier and i wish i had never downloaded tiktok as deep down i knew it wouldn t be good for me i m not saying no one should use tiktok or instagram or quit all social media if you delete it all it s not like all of your problems will disappear and your mental health won t automatically improve although in my case it did lower my anxiety quite a bit social media can connect people if you use it right but some platforms are less suited towards it and it all depends on your mindset towards it too i recognise that my mindset was unhealthy and it s my responsibility to take care of it even now i take a lot of breaks from social media and will delete social media apps on my phone whenever i recognise that i m using it mindlessly or as a time filler there are better things i can do that i enjoy more to fill my time

4,4_depression money_having money_money health_make money,1,having money s not everything not having it is that s a kanye bar but is some real shit i don t think money can buy happiness but i do believe lack of money almost guarantees you will not be it is impossible to be happy when you re worried about the next meal the next bill etc i get what you mean the only thing that helped me is creating a plan to get out of my financial situation sticking to it and learning to enjoy a quiet life until then my car will be paid off in a few months and for the first time in years will i feel like i have room to breathe
4,4_depression money_having money_money health_make money,2,some people can put money before health and remain healthy others of us can t and a priority inversion occurs meaning that a counterintuitive situation can occur where putting money as the top priority isn t the strategy that makes the most money because one s health never improves sufficiently to be profitable sometimes it may be better first and foremost to make changes in lifestyle environment and community that support health and are life affirming and then figure out how to make money from there it seems beneficial and important to first stabilize one s situation and find a comfort zone for therapy healing before pushing oneself hard to move out of the comfort zone and strengthen and grow as far as money is concerned this strategy can allow you to make some money in the short term rather than no money which is obviously preferable more importantly though in the long run it is better for health and improved life and improves prospects down the road for me i found that it helped me mentally emotionally and spiritually to spend time outdoors and be active from there i re discovered that i enjoyed helping neighbors doing landscaping trimming trees road maintenance and the like i also have enjoyed going for long walks as long as i was being mindful but not over thinking things and reflecting but not ruminating from there i realized that there are ways i could get paid to walk for example if i walked a neighbor s dog i have tended to get caught up in status issues and have found it demeaning to label myself a dog walker because i have worked in more challenging professions i m still working on ways to use cbt or relational frame therapy to reframe my attitude towards such a job title and the potential stigma it can have it seems more positive for me to think of the activity as doing a favor for someone helping someone in need volunteering or being charitable even though it is technically paid but where the money might be viewed as a bonus tip or donation or engaging in fun activity to play with dogs or go for a run or being a freelancer or a business owner maybe this seems silly but such things seem to influence a person s mental health through self esteem self image social image self confidence having a moderate and balanced amount of pride feeling respectable and respected rather than feeling shamed or guilted most people regardless of their mental state seem to want to be paid to do what they love so this is consistent with that and seems sensible i think business people and entrepreneurs will realize sooner or later that it s very valuable to have a workplace environment and culture that is positive psychologically safe respectful and supportive not chronically stressful disrespectful or demeaning such businesses have high turnover expensive political conflicts or hr issues struggle to grow or have growing pains have their reputations tarnished or struggle with quality consistency or competitiveness and it often seems they don t know why because they don t pay much attention to their people or don t respect them or just don t seek to improve their management practices the management is often so bad and intolerable to employees that many people find it more satisfying to start their own small business even though they take a lot of risk and work much harder and longer but this is another way that larger businesses lose talent and is another hidden cost for them some of these small business entrepreneurs now have youtube channels showing others what they do and how they ve done it and these are hopeful inspiring and educational to watch some of these youtube publishers have even developed small business communities almost like an informal freelance franchise
4,4_depression money_having money_money health_make money,3,money doesn t bring happiness but rather allows people the opportunity to find happiness if i had so much money i didn t have to work again i would be relieved and joyful at times but i wouldn t necessarily be happy it would allow me to move out of my parents house and have my own place and have more independence and not have to worry about mortgage payments and getting in debt which i think would definitely make me happier also i could have a new or atleast newer car which would make me happier as i wouldn t be anxious about my car potentially breaking down at any moment and not having the money to repair it a current dilemma and will always be able to afford to put food on the table with those things covered that prevents like of my daily anxieties of life and allows me to focus my time on figuring out what i want to do in life and what my purpose is something i am currently anxious about every day but don t have the time or money to figure out i also work with people of a similar age from very wealthy families they drive flash cars have time off and holidays when they want which is cool and all but the thing i m jealous about is that they ll never have to worry about money i look at them and wonder how that feels
