know i m real and i m here and i ve read what you ve said i promise i don t get sick of responding and you are no bother at all and you are not a burden in case you feel that way thank you for expressing your feelings to me and to talk about what you re dealing with i m sorry that what i m writing is going to be really long i hope you can read through it and bare with me you re absolutely sane and i don t need to know you personally to know that i went through your reddit post history a bit and i can see you are really really anxious and are going through a really hard time right now a lot of what you ve been posting saying is really similar honestly identical to what i was thinking feeling when i was in a really bad place with health anxiety whats happening is you are ruminating on these fears and you are putting yourself constantly on edge by anticipating these fears happening such as trying to see if you can hear things you might be on edge thinking you might finally visually hallucinate you are in constant fear when you remain in anticipation and fear you are making your cortisol levels and anxiety levels really high and because you re anticipating these fears your hormones are really high all day everyday when this happens your body will start producing symptoms due to the high stress hormones that are rising in your body and aren t going back down i don t know if you saw it but i have another post which goes over some symptoms you can experience when you re caught up in long term anxiety cycles have high anxiety and cortisol levels i would get dropping sensations swaying i d feel like i d fall through my bed or through the floor i d get dizzy spinny vision and this was worse when i was trying to sleep i felt like i would just float away from the earth or fall through it and that i was scrambling to just stay on the ground i felt completely like the world was falling away or that i wasn t real or i was going crazy i had the exact same thoughts as you i would be practically on edge waiting to hear voices random noises would terrify me i d struggle to fall asleep because i was hyper aware of sleeping sensations i d think i d hear loud sounds sometimes voices my train of thought would turn into nonsense and it d scare me my own inner voice scared me i was fully convinced i was turning psychotic would develop schizophrenia despite never actually having auditory or visual hallucinations other than when i d try to fall asleep and that is very very very normal and is not an indication of psychosis its known as hypnagogic hypnopompic hallucinations absolutely everything you are experiencing such as your dread the swaying the dizziness the dp dr spinning fear is all anxiety and they cannot hurt you and you cannot become psychotic because of it either nobody has and nobody ever will i promise you this is exactly what is happening to you you had a bad experience with something that made you feel afraid a bad weed experience and now you think you re stuck in that high that you ve done permanent damage like you re going crazy that you re stuck when the truth is you ve not been able to calm down or relax after a traumatic fearful event that happened to you and because you can t calm down your body is producing weird uncomfortable symptoms because of the hormones being amped up that is making you even more scared i m sending you another post because i ve accidentally written too much there should be another reply to you from me with the rest of what i want to say', 'ill try to answer them in order of how you asked them how do i keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time working out is the best option i was working out almost every day and when i went and really pushed myself and tired myself out i would walk out of the gym feeling great when i went there and sat around and barely did anything i would still walk away feeling shitty last week i went on a vacation and haven t worked out since and yesterday i spent all day laying in bed my brother came to visit and left and i barely talked to him reading this and going over it all in my head i might need to head back to the gym asap making going the gym a routine certainly seems to help me how can i keep up or have more energy this one is tough different things work for different people it might be diet or getting a pet because you love animals or just one or two amazing friends or even just a shit load of coffee all the adults seem to always be tired except for my neighbors who seem to run for miles everyday but there s no way i m doing that i m thinking of going back to school for nursing my current position lab tech doesn t feel fulfilling and i m looking for something more is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful yes yes yes doing something you want to do is x better than just sitting there and wishing you were doing it the only thing is are you able to go to school and not have it be a hindrance mostly economically because it costs a lot also time wise because school can be time consuming and science degrees are a bit more work if you really want to o it though it s worth it what are some habits i could do to alleviate my depression working out is one habit i mentioned before but theres more i took a positive psychology class in college and the things i learned from it helped but i always felt stupid doing it but they did work the two main practices i took away were a gratitude journal and strength awareness the gratitude journal is most effective when you do it daily try to write in a journal diary whatever at the end of the day and write one thing you liked about today it could be anything from a nice bite of a burger made a new friend the weather was nice watched a nice episode of tv or less traffic literally anything that made you feel better the second practice is strength awareness you know how you beat yourself up over the littlest things like saying you too back to a waiter after they say enjoy your food why it sucks but all of us do this now try to be aware of when you do something right when you build ikea furniture properly tell yourself good job when you communicate what you wanted to say well tell yourself good job just make it the opposite of that little naggy voice in your head thats so fucking annoying both these practices are pretty similar but that s because propping yourself up when you re depressed is hard as shit any secret self help feel good tips bruh i wish i just like animals so a lot of my reddit feed is filled with them but that s about all i got also definitely find a hobby mine is super simple with it being video games but i might need to change that up because i lcok myself up in a basement and talk to random kids online how do i make more friends and build a better support network bruh here too making friends as an adult is tough the easiest way i found is hobbies like i mentioned above but other than that i m stumped what do i tell to my friends who have noticed i just disappeared for a few days i m not the greatest at lying but you could always say you got really sick and were driving to get some medicine because you thought you were fine and then you got tired and lost control and then totalled it they re gonna ask about your car too when they don t see it so try to incorporate that into the lie you don t have to give them all the details and once you tell them you went to the hospital they won t really care about the rest of the story and will just wonder if you re okay hope this helped and good luck friend edit i keep trying to format it so that it quotes your questions but pffff it s not working', 'sorry ahead of time for the long post i just felt like writing today i guess this is the most powerful thing you have probably ever done and in years you will both be much better off you so will thank you for this assuming you and him make both of your mental well being the number focus in your life at this point it s do or die there are many examples in my own family and group of friends where their success came down to the decision to seek treatment or not my dad was an alcoholic not a nasty one just a quiet drinker who started to see his health fail he recognized it after pressure from his family he is now years sober in great health and following his dreams on the other hand one of my best friends died years ago from a drug overdose he refused to go to treatment and paid the ultimate price in a lot of ways he probably saved the lives of guys in our group of friends including my own after he passed me and other friends made it our mission to clean up i made it my life mission to deal with my depression and bipolar i had to sink to the bottom live with my parents and research the hell out of treatments etc at times it looked very bleak but after about a year and the loss of my job many friends and my pride i started going up i m now years later treated and chasing my dreams a friend of mine relapsed on meth we took him to rehab but he refused fortunately it was a reality check and he has been doing better ever since depression and mental i ll as is hard many of my group had drug and alcohol problems but it was just a symptom of the underlying depression and anxiety once we treated that all other problems disappeared life comes down to big turning points and forks in the road this is a huge one for you guys i know you feel like you are at the bottom right now but it s really just the beginning of your journey to the top you will never make it up if you you stayed stuck in that limbo at the bottom though it s really hard right now just have faith that things will get better because you are doing something about it and grasp the hope that comes with that my experience now that i am well and i can look back on my journey my dvice going forward is to make it your number mission in life to attack your depression and anxiety even if it takes losing your job your relationships etc put all your money effort and time into it fixing it takes revamping every part of your life including professional help medication diet this has been one of the biggest factors activity group of friends spiritual i m not religious but i pray and self talk boundaries use of social media etc always remember that even the smartest mental health professionals do not know everything about mental i ll as how why when etc treatment consists of many factors you basically seek professional help and you and them start trying various forms of treatment until you find something that works consistently there will be times you get a placebo effect for a couple weeks and start to feel shitty again don t fret you just need to move on and try the next thing it s usually not just one magic pill it s a combination of various treatments that can include cbt meds diet etc your doctor s are also extremely important keep trying new doctors until you find one that you feel comfortable and confident in find one that you feel really cares about you and your well being it literally took me years but half to of that time was spent denying that i had a problem if you guys both accept that you need help you have a huge head start and can tackle this relatively quickly keep up the good work you are doing the right thing sorry for the long post i just wanted to tell you that there are many people who have made it to the other side and are happy treated and pursuing their dreams but most of these people went through hell to get there always remind yourself that you will tackle this no matter what and until you do it will be your and only mission in life']"

didn t know what i want to do just generally was stuck in the mud i was also an atheist for about years i was an atheist i left christianity with a bad taste in my mouth i hope someone nails me on that joke all puns intended i know you can take me out back and shoot me later i found heathenry about may of last year it was and still and seems to be what i was looking for the community the faith the way it made me feel i had found my passion again if you haven t been told before look into heathenry it s the faith of the norse and viking people if you didn t know and you dont need to practice the faith if you don t want cuz of your current religious affiliations but the values they hold and the aspect they look at life at is to me motivating it gets me out of bed and ready for the upcoming day it gets me through times of stress and times of strife you mentioned you like learning odin is the norse equivalent to zeus he is the father of all gods anyways not tryin to preach to ya just giving you a little background odin is also the god of knowledge and the stellar example of what the norse people beloved a man should be smart cunning loving stern courageous deliberate loyal strong and most important to me humble i urge you to hang in there dude life isn t all that bad i understand you have bad luck but life is what you make it also those people you talk about aren t your friends even the ones you like if they were real friends whether they re your best friend or not they wouldn t care who they re around when they talk to you the heathen community is very strong minded even if you re not interested in it go find a heathen and talk to them get to know them they ll be some of the most genuine people you ll ever meet hope you find the release you need without the death part bro from texas with love peace homie', 'i ve dealt with suicidal thought for the better part of my life i reached a point where i truly felt as though i lost everything turned not long ago mental health suffering tied into this unnatural emotional attachment to someone drinking life critical volumes of alcohol and eventually turned to hard drugs i wanted to die i spent days figuring it out went on the prominent forums seeking information and advice i m a felon so a gun was difficult to obtain i woke up one day few hours of sleep like usual coming down off all the hard shit i was doing and just lost the desire i began thinking of how much i wanted to tell someone in particular i was doing it how every other method of suicide was subject to failure and if i did this i d possibly be found thought about eventually getting a gun sending them a message of it and that this is the end take care and i m sorry for everything how much i actually cared for this person and honestly regretted everything i said and did because they weren t responsible for why i was doing this i just had too many issues and transposed on them i was so ashamed of everything i had done how i made them feel and how i truly wanted them to be happy i never meant to do all the things i did and hurt them because i was hurt and unable to cope with unreciprocated feelings i didn t want to die an immature homeless junkie i didn t want to put that on anyone ever i m not religious and have little belief in anything other than complete nothingness post death i ve never feared death only failure but it wasn t my place to do this not to a young girl i irrationally fixated on and developed irrational emotion for it wasn t her fault it was mine even if there s nothing but dark nothingness after it s all over no concern or worry i refused to affect a living being because of my unbearable desire to not be around i d rather suffer every day of every minute than die knowing this is my legacy and how i affected the world because of my misery of course i still want to die in the back of my mind i don t know how to cope with this loss and i can t just turn around from the lowest point in my life and expect to make something of life i have to face this misery and knowing i may never realize the life i truly desired for the end of my days i don t know how many days i ll feel like actually not wanting to exist but i owe it to myself and to others to try and make something of it i can t die like this i can t die in all this regret and knowing i never gave it my best and let everyone down as much as i want to cease the conscious self that continues to torment me with every single damn regret and mistake i ve ever fucking made as much as i want to paint the wall with all of those stupid choices i made in spite of the opportunity and chances provided to me i can t do it it s not time not yet i don t know what there is but if i found reason in the deepest depths of drug fueled misery and complete emotional volatility beyond understanding i gotta find out what the hell happened and why i didn t go through with it if i have to live my life in misery for the sake of others and in the shadow of the mistakes i ve made so be it i can deal with my own misery i can hold my hand to the flame until there s nothing but bone but i can t deal with the thought of others in misery because of my own i only hope that in time things will change and true desire to live will come to be if not i accept that i accept my mistakes and will do my best to make something of life until it s time to go i only hope that if i have to endure not much more than life of misery and regret those who i care about will realize the best of everything they can and impact the world in a positive way when my time does come i hope it s fair enough and i ll feel everything is okay enough to leave nothingness is fine one life is more than enough to experience']"

guarantees you will not be it is impossible to be happy when you re worried about the next meal the next bill etc i get what you mean the only thing that helped me is creating a plan to get out of my financial situation sticking to it and learning to enjoy a quiet life until then my car will be paid off in a few months and for the first time in years will i feel like i have room to breathe', 'some people can put money before health and remain healthy others of us can t and a priority inversion occurs meaning that a counterintuitive situation can occur where putting money as the top priority isn t the strategy that makes the most money because one s health never improves sufficiently to be profitable sometimes it may be better first and foremost to make changes in lifestyle environment and community that support health and are life affirming and then figure out how to make money from there it seems beneficial and important to first stabilize one s situation and find a comfort zone for therapy healing before pushing oneself hard to move out of the comfort zone and strengthen and grow as far as money is concerned this strategy can allow you to make some money in the short term rather than no money which is obviously preferable more importantly though in the long run it is better for health and improved life and improves prospects down the road for me i found that it helped me mentally emotionally and spiritually to spend time outdoors and be active from there i re discovered that i enjoyed helping neighbors doing landscaping trimming trees road maintenance and the like i also have enjoyed going for long walks as long as i was being mindful but not over thinking things and reflecting but not ruminating from there i realized that there are ways i could get paid to walk for example if i walked a neighbor s dog i have tended to get caught up in status issues and have found it demeaning to label myself a dog walker because i have worked in more challenging professions i m still working on ways to use cbt or relational frame therapy to reframe my attitude towards such a job title and the potential stigma it can have it seems more positive for me to think of the activity as doing a favor for someone helping someone in need volunteering or being charitable even though it is technically paid but where the money might be viewed as a bonus tip or donation or engaging in fun activity to play with dogs or go for a run or being a freelancer or a business owner maybe this seems silly but such things seem to influence a person s mental health through self esteem self image social image self confidence having a moderate and balanced amount of pride feeling respectable and respected rather than feeling shamed or guilted most people regardless of their mental state seem to want to be paid to do what they love so this is consistent with that and seems sensible i think business people and entrepreneurs will realize sooner or later that it s very valuable to have a workplace environment and culture that is positive psychologically safe respectful and supportive not chronically stressful disrespectful or demeaning such businesses have high turnover expensive political conflicts or hr issues struggle to grow or have growing pains have their reputations tarnished or struggle with quality consistency or competitiveness and it often seems they don t know why because they don t pay much attention to their people or don t respect them or just don t seek to improve their management practices the management is often so bad and intolerable to employees that many people find it more satisfying to start their own small business even though they take a lot of risk and work much harder and longer but this is another way that larger businesses lose talent and is another hidden cost for them some of these small business entrepreneurs now have youtube channels showing others what they do and how they ve done it and these are hopeful inspiring and educational to watch some of these youtube publishers have even developed small business communities almost like an informal freelance franchise', 'money doesn t bring happiness but rather allows people the opportunity to find happiness if i had so much money i didn t have to work again i would be relieved and joyful at times but i wouldn t necessarily be happy it would allow me to move out of my parents house and have my own place and have more independence and not have to worry about mortgage payments and getting in debt which i think would definitely make me happier also i could have a new or atleast newer car which would make me happier as i wouldn t be anxious about my car potentially breaking down at any moment and not having the money to repair it a current dilemma and will always be able to afford to put food on the table with those things covered that prevents like of my daily anxieties of life and allows me to focus my time on figuring out what i want to do in life and what my purpose is something i am currently anxious about every day but don t have the time or money to figure out i also work with people of a similar age from very wealthy families they drive flash cars have time off and holidays when they want which is cool and all but the thing i m jealous about is that they ll never have to worry about money i look at them and wonder how that
