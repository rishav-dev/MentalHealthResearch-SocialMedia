depression,1hbhxzp,m1gl8bm,I went outward and vocal recently. Now hardly anyone wants to talk to me anymore. Funny how that works.,286
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gpf8q,It’s all fun and games until you haven’t showered in 5 days and eat <1 meal per day and get scared to leave the house.,164
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gi67g,"I know what you mean… I was very gangsta about depression. And before 5-6 years when this motherfucker got me i changed my mind and understanding about it…

Now i want to appologize to every depressed person in the world !!!!",66
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gplp2,"I feel this so deeply, I hid it for years and when I finally broke at my lowest and spoke out for help and vocalized I needed the help. I lost everyone and everything near to me. I lost my entire friend group, family support, I lost trust from coworkers. 

Then my roommates kicked me out because they weren't comfortable with how bad I really was. Despite the only difference was me being fully honest about how low I was.",41
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gpecn,Those are the same people who are like I never saw the signs! Fucking idiots,36
depression,1hbhxzp,m1hd928,"You're not alone in feeling this way, and honestly, you’ve touched on something a lot of people don’t want to admit. Society likes the *idea* of supporting mental health, but when it comes to the messy, raw reality of it—like clinical depression or more severe struggles—it gets uncomfortable for people. It’s almost like there’s a limit to the empathy they’re willing to give, and once you cross it, they don’t know how to respond.

It sucks because being vocal and honest about those darker moments is when you need support the most. But instead, you’re met with silence or awkwardness, which makes the isolation even worse. People mean well, but sometimes their own discomfort takes over, and they pull back instead of leaning in.

Hating everyone and yourself is such a heavy burden to carry, and I hope you’re able to give yourself grace in this moment. The fact that you’re even sharing this shows strength, even if it doesn’t feel like it. You’re not doomed—none of us are—but we do have a lot of growing to do as a society when it comes to truly being there for each other.

For now, know this: your feelings are valid, and being frustrated with people’s lack of understanding doesn’t make you wrong or broken. It just means you see the gap between where we are and where we should be. That’s a painful but powerful awareness.",39
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gvtsc,"Yeah I think it scares people and most don’t understand depression as much as they’d like to think. Lots of people think they’ve been depressed when actually what they’ve experienced is a period of low mood, so they don’t get it when you’re frank about how bad things have gotten. Saying you’re sad is ok, but telling people about your derelict home, worst inner thoughts, or seeing a decline in how you take care of yourself, not so much. Sometimes you got to save it for the professionals/people who have been in the same position. It’s hard to understand what you haven’t experienced. I hope things get better for you, stay strong and show up for yourself. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel but it is a journey to say the least.",27
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gm1el,"One of the bullshit excuses my ex gave me for breaking up was that I was too ""negative"". I don't think I was. Sure there were times when I was outwardly depressed and suicidal but it got less frequent as the relationship went on because I got help. She also said I wasn't upbeat enough. I feel like I was. Not to mention that she spent a lot of our time together crying over other people's choices in life that are out of her control. But sure, I'm the one with mental problems.",45
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gn9aw,"Well, you see, people are cool about mental HEALTH, people are very much *Not Cool* about mental ILLNESS. That's the difference!!! mental ""health"" includes periods of ""negative mental health"" can they conflate that with mental illness, which they very much do not understand or empathise with. Everybody has mental health, not everybody has mental illness. Honestly I actually think the criteria for depression as a disorder is far too broad bc most people will have periods of mild depression in their life..

whereas i've had depression my ENTIRE life basically, at least since like.. 8yo, if not younger, and anxiety at least since i was like 10/11 and i'm 27 now.",39

depression,1hbhxzp,m1hgtw6,This. I let a fraction of the depression show in moments of extreme tiredness and now I feel my life is over. I got 3 bad reactions and funny enough one is a mental health advocate who gives workshops and public speeches about it.,13
depression,1hbhxzp,m1h90m7,I went a little too outward lately and ended up losing a therapist because of liability and my high “suicidal tendencies” they couldn’t help me and tried getting me to get hospitalized or inpatient processing. Now it’s back to bottling it back all up.,10
depression,1hbhxzp,m1i4azy,"I'm 34 and I'm still bouncing around from roommates to roommates because I have a low income. 

Every single time I live with someone it's beyond embarrassing because I can't hide my severe depression/ anxiety from the people I live with. 

As in I spend days at a time laying in bed if I'm not working, episodes of binge drinking, avoiding socializing with my roommates in any capacity, not eating for days, no hygiene, inability to function at all. And the reaction is always the same- shock and mild to moderate disgust. 

I've met so many people who claim to have depression and anxiety that I live with and I think it's total BS- almost everyone I've ever lived with has a ton of energy, and are highly highly functional to the point that there is literally no way they have clinical depression. Which just makes me feel worse because it solidifies the truth that something is genuinely wrong with me. I have less and less friends as time goes on.",10
depression,1hbhxzp,m1jm392,"Seen a lot of these posts recently and I resonate so much. It's all ""mental health matters"" until people distance themselves from you bc of your depression and what they classify as ""negative, toxic attitude"" or ""draining to be around"". A lot of people hate the visible signs of mental illness with a passion, they just haven't connected the dots and tend to have this romanticised image of it in their mind. 

The most brutal blackpill on humanity is that a smiling, narcissistic sociopath who hides their dysfunction will be much more liked by people than an authentic, honest depressed person who cares a lot about things.",9
depression,1hbhxzp,m1h3jfa,I’ve gotten people to care but the amount of kindness I need to display in my day to day life to get people to do so is absurd and can’t be expected from the average person.,8
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gusuz,"My boyfriend literally told me tonight that “it’s not his responsibility” to fix me. I NEVER asked him to????

He said “go inpatient, and we’ll talk when you’re done”.

He’s mad because I’ve not been frequently speaking to him. Because, depression. Not him. Thought I loved him.


Am I overreacting? Because damn dude, if you can’t handle me at my absolute lowest, where I’m thinking of blowing my brains out every single second, what makes you think I want to stay with you when I finally feel better? You’re abandoning me during I time when I need support, not fixing.",12
depression,1hbhxzp,m1icp4h,"Well, the same goes for physical sickness. We are wired to stay away from sick people. 

Going against that requires serious motivation.",5
depression,1hbhxzp,m1ijrqb,"I cried in front of my mother recently randomly, I never do and good at keeping composure and a straight face. It builds up day by day and sometimes you can't fake it anymore",6
depression,1hbhxzp,m1iokkm,I cut my own hair 3 days ago because I was desperate for something I could control. But people who comment on my haircut are looking for a happy explanation and get really uncomfortable when I tell the truth.,6
depression,1hbhxzp,m1jw72b,"Well, I think this thread proves that not everyone is an insensitive, patronizing asshole about depression (""Just go for a walk! Eat cabbage on Tuesdays! Church!"" And so on.)

We've got at least twenty (more?} people on here who get it. Out of 8 billion people on the planet... that's...um...a really small percentage.  But at least there are a few of us fellow travelers who do understand!  

I have come to think it's part of the evil bitch that depression is.  Everyone of those 8 billion people knows what it feels like.  They've experienced it. Missed out on promotion.  Failed a grade in school. Lost a relative. Broken up with SO. Had terrible lingering illness. Lots of things can make us feel depressed.

But then these people make the gigantic mistake of thinking that whatever they experienced while ""depressed"" is the sum total of depression.  They are absolutely convinced that they know exactly how you feel and exactly how to fix you.

They have no effin' clue that they have experienced the tip of the iceberg only, no clue how deep and dark and massive the iceberg really is, and (usually) no desire to learn.  

So, as a fellow traveler who has spent more time under that iceberg than on the surface, screw all those ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps"" people and their unhelpful advice.

Just remember or try to believe that it gets better.  I know how phony and stupid that sounds, especially when you're in the darkness. But I swear to you that it's true.  Even when the simple act of continuing to breathe and just staying alive seems impossible, remember that this reddit rando is thinking of you and pulling for you. Because it does get better. I promise.

No thanks to those superficial so-called friends offering yoga and smoothies and other such stuff--sadly, they aren't ever going to get it. So forget about them and focus on yourself and the things that help you. The things that make you happy or even just less down. And you can work your way out from that iceberg and its numbing enormity.

Sometimes it feels like one step forward, twenty-seven steps back. And the depression iceberg seems to block all the light, holding you immovable, trapped. But if you can hold on for one more breath, one more minute, and maybe one or two more, you can start to feel a tiny bit of movement somewhere deep inside yourself. And gradually, that bit of movement gets big enough for you to take a shower, say, or have a snack. Watch an episode of TV or read a book.  Go stand outside or even go for a walk. 

Please, please remember that even in the depths of despair, when all seems lost, it isn't.  It does get better.  



Full disclosure:  I do have a ""magic answer"" to depression.  For me, it's my cats.  I swear they have saved my life over the years.  Cats are awesome sauce. 😻",5
depression,1hbhxzp,m1i6ucg,"people don't know what to do. so they lash out BC they feel powerless and anxious and just want to be under less pressure to be a decent parent, friend etc or pretend the problem doesn't exist. so basically, a ton of people are just stupid with low emotional intelligence and mental capacity. they are only out for themselves. it's hard to accept that but from my experiences it is very much true. ",3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1gryg7,Yep agreed. No one has the time or energy to support anothers health issues.,3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1hw11i,"I've been a diagnosed MDD since I was 14. It has more accessories now, but I won't get into that. I will say, I go through periods of what I call depression lite and major depressive episodes. I am very vocal about mental health and am the person most friends talk to about their anxiety or depression because I am so candid about my own struggles.  

I have a new friend dealing with a depressive bout, and I am so thankful that they feel I am a safe person to talk to about it. Sometimes, they want a sympathetic ear. Others helping them deal with the lies their brain is feeding them. Maybe a distraction or just company. 


Not everyone needs the same support, and not everyone is able to offer it. If people aren't giving you the support you need and you express your needs clearly seek it elsewhere. 

Get your GP involved, try medication,  try therapy, or look into CBT you can do on your own. Try journaling or art therapy. Visit local support groups. Call a friend or family and just have a conversation. Go outside and just be around other people. Even if it's just sitting on a bench in the park or walking your neighborhood. If you withdraw and push people away, it will be harder to connect, and we need that connection.  That need for connection is just as hardwired as the survival mechanisms of depression.  

I hope you are able to find support in your life. I hope things improve for you. Please don't give up and keep trying to connect.",3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1i5f6p,It’s so easy to say the wrong thing. People are scared.,3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1kmwex,"Lost a friend over this. She acted so weird when I was open and honest. I was in shock, because she seemed like she would be a great supportive friend in any situation. Now I know that most people are just fake and only care about themselves. I have 2 friends that get it, because they also struggle with depression. I stick to those friends.",3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1kuzsv,"I know this is going a little off-topic, or maybe not. But I think of the extreme part of depression when people experience suicide ideation. Not long ago there was a commercial campaign about suicide awareness and the importance of reaching out. The intention was well meant, but I couldn't help feeling cynical. A very close friend I had would on occasion mention those feelings to me. She knew I too had depression and we'd talk through the feelings she had. But when I once mentioned those same feelings she told me we should stay out of contact for a month because she didn't want to say anything that would, quote, push me over the edge. It was very confusing.

Ironically, mental health professionals can be the worst. Medication always seems viewed as first and often only line of action. When I tell them my long history with anti-depressants and many awful adverse reactions, then I'm often viewed with outright skepticism, or told I'm being resistant. No, I know my body and what it can/can't handle. If there's mention of suicidal feelings then it's as if I've pulled a fire alarm, so I won't mention those feelings anymore.",3
depression,1hbhxzp,m1minju,Number one reason I’ll never be vocal. But when you look at the suicide hotline it tells you to tell someone. But who the fuck wants to help someone who wants to end it all when everyone already is having a tough time,3

depression,1hbhxzp,m1l77ho,"When it comes to depression, honestly, people just fail to provide comfort and empathy.

Well I struggled too, but I got over it!!! Why can't youuuu?!?!?""",2
depression,1hbhxzp,m1lj0wx,Speak up they say. Until we do and they are faced with the ugliness that can be mental health struggles. Feelings are meant to be told to a walk and that’s it. Anything else will bite you in the ass one day or another trust me.,2

depression,1hbhxzp,m1hf6sb,"Yep.  Ask for the support you need,  that they've sworn they will provide to you..... 👻 👻 👻 


Or get gaslighted,  that you don't REALLY feel that way,  that's not real,  you're wrong about how you feel, that doctor must be wrong, that they were sad a couple weeks when they broke up with their freshman HS bf and are FINE why aren't you....


Then,  when your partner or family member gets seriously long-term sick or injured,  everyone calling to check on them, fed them,  cheer them,  listen to them,  because it's a REAL illness.

depression,1hbhxzp,m1kqjag,"I'm sorry this happened to you, but I get it. What really disappoints and confuses me is the hypocrisy of some people. The ""I can talk about my struggles with anxiety/ but don't mention yours to me"" type of people. One of the strangest was someone I've known for years on social media. He shares fairly regularly about his issues with anxiety and depression with those on his friends list. One time I said I understood and mentioned fears I had associated with those two issues. He responded by implying mine was somehow a weakness that needed overcoming. WTH? I try to only bring up the subject with people I trust and only if it comes up naturally in conversation.

depression,kcbaxe,gfphn6k,"Religion and believing in God has nothing to do with our mental health. 

The fact that the religious people around you don't realize that is horrible. My mother, who has a master's in Christian theology as well as my own pastor recommended me to see a therapist and doctor about my depression.

There is a stigma about mental health and Christianity and being able to ""pray away"" your mental health problems; but you wouldn’t tell someone with cancer, diabetes or heart problems to just pray about it or give it to God, would you? You'd probably say something like ""you need medication, or a doctor.""

I'm so sorry that your parents don't understand the human body. 

Why can't your doctor do the tests/prescribe the medication for you at this point? Do your parents sit in the room with you when you go for clinic visits? If they do, try asking for a private diagnosis with you doctor.

If that doesn't work, I know you said that you're not comfortable taking to your youth group leaders about it, but asking them to talk to your parents about seeking medical attention might be the next best thing you can do, since they won't listen to your doctor. 

I can tell you that 80% of the people in my home group/youth group are diagnosed clinically depressed, we share our worries and problems all the time. Youth group leaders are there to help you, and if you don't want to say anything face to face, maybe texting or emailing could help!",56

They seem students will a whole host of problems, from issues at home to mental health and they’ll direct you to a school psychologist if need be (assuming there’s one) or try to come up with a solution, which might include the councilor asking the parents to come speak to them. The councilor may be able to convince them that you need therapy and direct you to resources if they refuse. I bet that there probably are local organizations that deal with mental health issues of young teens who either can’t afford therapy normally or have some kind of restrictions at home.",9
depression,kcbaxe,gfpi5b9,"Pragmatically you could check at what age you can get a prescription without your parent's consent or them being there in person - for me, it was like age 16. Also keep in mind, that as horrible and unfair as this is, worst case - when you turn 18 you'll be able to get antidepressants by yourself. 

To be honest your best bet is to talk to someone at your school and get help through them. I know it's not what you want and it's going to be difficult with social anxiety, but it's probably the best you can get out of this situation. I'm assuming your not at a religious school.

Remember, you don't have to tell them everything in one go, even with a therapist, it takes time to tell them everything, and it gets easier over time. Even if you just say you need some help, you've been feeling depressed lately and your feeling anxious, that should be enough to get your school to help you in some part. You don't have to mention cutting or the family things. And if you get comfortable with your school counsellor, maybe then you can tell them more about whats going on.

Frankly, in an ideal world I would say to go and get your school and ask them to get child protective services involved, I mean to me it sounds like physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect, You shouldn't, no one should, have to go through that.

I know that's probably way too much for you. But that's what you should deserve to have because it's an absolutely awful position to be in.",7

depression,kcbaxe,gfpxiw8,"I’ve raised 2 kids that were adopted through foster care. They had a lot of emotional/mental issues so I have some experience with getting help. 

If you are feeling at all suicidal, you need to tell your doctor immediately. In my state (probably in most), if a minor makes the statement that they’re thinking of harming themselves and have thought out ways to do it (formed a plan on how to do it) they will tell the parents to take you to a mental health facility (they call them emergency stabilization hospitals). In my state the doctor won’t even allow your parents to leave with you until either an appointment is made at the hospital for you to go straight there or until an ambulance comes to take you there. They do not just let your parents walk out the door with you. They will do an intake there and determine if you need to stay. If the parents refuse the doctors can (and usually will) contact CPS who will get a judge to order you into the hospital for an evaluation. 

This sounds scary but these places can be a huge help. You stay for a week or so and they work on the right medication dosage and a diagnoses. Now if CPS / a judge orders you into this place, at least in my state, your parents HAVE to follow the orders of the psychiatrists when they release you. If it’s therapy and continued medication, they can get into trouble for not following through with it.

If you’re not suicidal, talk to your school counselor immediately. They are trained to not only deal with the mental health side but also with parents who don’t want to pursue help. Again, since you’re a minor, if your mental health seems to be serious enough and your parents aren’t taking steps for professional help, the counselor may contact CPS. This doesn’t mean CPS will remove you from your home. They may just step in and force your parents into getting you help.

Please keep reaching out to people until someone takes action. I would even go so far as to give into their wishes and try talking to someone within your church. They may very well see this is more serious than some sort of spiritual issue and advise your parents to get you professional help.",6

Mental health help is the best thing for you as you already know so here's my plan for you. Would you be a le to talk to your youth group leader to at least explain you need help WITH prayer(whether you do pray/believe or not is of course your choice and no one else's ;) )? The angle with conservative religious types is not to convince them they are wrong but that it may be God's Will for you to get help from a professional and I bet your youth pastor could help them see it that way.

The joy of the Lord is my strength, right? Later in college, I had another major depressive episode that was so much worse than the first. I had to drop out of college for a while. It has taken years of meds and therapy to recover and I am nowhere close to whole yet. Now on top of that, I am dealing with religious trauma that is causing my body to be physically ill in other ways.

I have had family find out about my medication and tell me, ""Isn't the Bible enough?"" These family members now run a Christian ""counseling center"" at their church. I have had friends tell me to ""just have faith."" If I had believed them, I would be dead a hundred times over by now. I have always wondered if the second episode ever would have happened if it had received proper treatment for the first episode.

I know that involving outside people in your treatment is scary given your situation. But please - think of your future. Your body/mind will NOT heal itself from depression without help. Think of it like a broken leg. The longer you walk on it, the longer it will take to heal. And if you walk on a broken leg long enough, it will never mend properly. I'm not saying that to take away your hope; I'm saying that to encourage you to consider risking your relationship with your mom now in order to secure your future (and present) health. If I had received treatment earlier, I am convinced my 20s would have been far healthier.

I'm sorry that the people who are supposed to be advocating for you are failing you right now. I don't know if any of this will prove helpful. If you want to talk more about depression, especially in a faith context which we seem to have in common, I'm here.",1

But some do!  Granted, and thankfully, they are a small minority.  We also don't hear many horror stories about parents withholding treatment so their child can be healed by the tent ministry that is coming through next weekend.  

I am not a Christianity basher by any stretch.  What drove me away was politics, not ideology.  That said when I encounter the line that ""God can heal all"" I tend to counter with ""what about an amputee?""  As far as I can tell He never healed one in the past.

Christianity needs more minds like yours.",3

depression,1nakuld,ncuycsj,"It really depends on what state you live in and what’s available. I live in a state ranked I think dead last in mental health resources, but I was referred by my therapist to a behavioral health center for many of the same things you are dealing with. I went the same day for an assessment and started PHP a few days later. I went from June through August and it has saved my life. 
Every place is different so I can’t speak for other PHP centers or medical centers for mental health, I just know the one I went to has the best therapists, Nurse Practitioners (shoutout to nurse Denver) and that I’ve ever had or known. Ever.

I was the only person in group therapy (PHP was group therapy 5 days a week for 4 hours a day - it’s a lot) that hadn’t attempted suicide or hadn’t been admitted to their inpatient program for being actively suicidal. I was terrified for about two minutes and after the group members started talking, I knew I was in the right spot. 

So many people in that group, all of them really, are amazing humans. All talented and unique, and some were so young it was heartbreaking that all of us were in our lowest of lows or had been. Most people had been there already for a couple of months and were discharging because they were ready and started to feel their feelings again, and have hope that the sparkly parts of them were still there. It was inspiring. 

I would definitely recommend going in for an assessment to see what they recommend and hopefully insurance and all of that covers treatment needed. My insurance allowed a max amount of days and I was not ready to be done or didn’t have the care  necessary for continuing improvement. 

They were able to have me step down to IOP at the same location.  I had been to IOP before when I got sober in 2020. I knew what to expect for the most part but it’s better than expected. I have been struggling lately just dealing with my employer and the insurance company that handles disability payments, so I didn’t show up to IOP last Thursday. My therapist from the group called me when I was 5 minutes late and I had no plans of going. I was disassociating and spiraling terribly. 

She somehow, within two minutes, helped me flip a switch and get to therapy. I was an hour late, but I’m grateful for someone just caring enough to call when I didn’t show. 

Anyway that’s my experience and I hope it has helped give you some information on PHP.",1

depression,7agnoi,dpaocxs,"Sorry ahead of time for the long post. I just felt like writing today I guess...

This is the most powerful thing you have probably ever done and in 5 years, you will both be much better off. You SO will thank you for this, assuming you and him make both of your mental well-being the number 1 focus in your life. At this point it's do or die. There are many examples in my own family and group of friends where their success came down to the decision to seek treatment or not...

My dad was an alcoholic, not a nasty one, just a quiet drinker who started to see his health fail. He recognized it, after pressure from his family. He is now 7 years sober, in great health and following his dreams.

On the other hand, one of my best friends died 6 years ago from a drug overdose. He refused to go to treatment and paid the ultimate price. In a lot of ways, he probably saved the lives of 3 guys in our group of friends,including my own. After he passed, me and 2 other friends made it our mission to clean up.

 I made it my life mission to deal with my depression and bipolar. I had to sink to the bottom, live with my parents and research the hell out of treatments etc. At times it looked very bleak, but after about a year and the loss of my job, many friends and my pride, I started going up. I'm now (5 years later) treated and chasing my dreams. 

A friend of mine relapsed on meth, we took him to rehab, but he refused, fortunately, it was a reality check and he has been doing better ever since. 

Depression and mental I'll as is hard. Many of my group had drug and alcohol problems, but it was just a symptom of the underlying depression and anxiety. Once we treated that, all other problems disappeared. 

Life comes down to big turning points and forks in the road. This is a huge one for you guys. I know you feel like you are at the bottom right now, but it's really just the beginning of your journey to the top! You will never make it up if you you stayed stuck in that limbo at the bottom. Though it's really hard right now, just have faith that things WILL get better because you are doing something about it and grasp the hope that comes with that!

My experience, now that I am well and I can look back on my journey... My dvice going forward is to make it your number 1 mission in life to attack your depression and anxiety... Even if it takes losing your job, your relationships, etc. Put all your money, effort, and time into it. Fixing it takes revamping every part of your life including; professional help, medication, diet (this has been one of the biggest factors), activity, group of friends, spiritual (I'm not religious, but I pray and self-talk), boundaries, use of social media, etc.

Always remember that even the smartest mental health professionals do not know everything about mental I'll as, how, why, when etc. Treatment consists of many factors. You basically seek professional help and you and them start trying various forms of treatment until you find something that works consistently. There will be times you get a placebo effect for a couple weeks and start to feel shitty again. Don't fret, you just need to move on and try the next thing. It's usually not just one magic pill, it's a combination of various treatments that can include CBT, meds, diet etc. Your doctor(s) are also extremely important. Keep trying new doctors until you find one that you feel comfortable and confident in. Find one that you feel really cares about you and your well being.

It literally took me 10 years, but half to 3/4 of that time was spent denying that I had a problem. If you guys both accept that you need help,you have a HUGE head start and can tackle this relatively quickly! 

Keep up the good work, you are doing the right thing! Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to tell you that there are many people who have made it to the other side and are happy, treated, and pursuing their dreams, but most of these people went through hell to get there. Always remind yourself that you will tackle this no-matter what, and until you do, it will be your #1 and only mission in life.

I know, I went too far, but to say that she cares...... she couldn't care less, or at least doesn't want to care. I did what I did to protect her, knowing full well she would stop protecting me.

It's not an excuse for the pain that it caused both of us, but I think it was necessary because it opened both of our eyes to the fact that shit needed to change.

Sometimes you just can't help yourself without pushing someone else away. One of the hardest things to do when you feel like a miserable sack of shit is to be selfless and loving.

We have gotten back together, and are ""starting over"" in our approach toward healthy communication and healthy self-images.

depression,uwm8rs,i9u2kdz,"Could you be a CNA? It's hard on the body but training is short and cheap. 

&#x200B;

I am a nurse. Helping others is therapeutic. I find that, as a depressive, I can understand patients who otherwise have difficulty communicating. If you can't do CNA work, could you do housekeeping or something in a long-term care facility? What's the context? Is there a certain amount you need to earn? You sound young.

&#x200B;

Anxiety and depression are very common. Try to remember that everyone is also busy in their own head with their own narratives and discomforts. For example, a coworker friend of mine asked me why I was glaring at her. I said, ""I'm not glaring at you. I can barely see you. I was kinda lost in thought thinking about how I went to see an eye doctor who told me my vision wasn't bad enough to warrent glasses. Well, I still can't see well and I wish I had told him to damn his own opinion and make me some glasses. I was just thinking if I didn't know you were working tonight, I wouldn't know who you were because my night vision is poor."" Kind of a long winded example to show how usually other people are too busy with their own problems to have the energy to judge you. Most people are not mean. Some people are mean. You can't change those people, but you can learn to change your reaction to them, how they make you feel. 

&#x200B;

People really have no business being mean. There's already a surplus of meanness in the world and a shortage of kindness. So, just by being a good person yourself, you are doing plenty. You want to help your family, get a job, and be functional in society in spite having a serious illness (depression is number one cause of disability in US and the world). Those are things that good people aspire for. So, you're already a good person. You have worth, place, and value; you are contributing to the kindness deficit in the world. There are a lot of circimstances in life that make us feel burdonsome, like the oppresively high cost of living. But remember society is imperfect. Native Americans didn't believe in owning property, and for that, they were killed, so their property could be owned, so it could be sold, and turned into a profit. There is a concentration of money and power in the hands of few people who are not particularly worthy; many are, in fact, also very corrupt! The Earth is polluted. This is far from ideal. 

&#x200B;

Mental illness does not define you. You're the atmosphere, not the rain cloud; unlike the rain cloud, you can see both the atmosphere and the rain cloud. You have something to give the world. 

&#x200B;

There are people in the world who you can connect with. It's ok to be shy and anxious, you can still have meaningful conversations with others. Be patient kind to yourself. Have you read the 7 habits of highly effective people? One of them stands out to me: ""seek to understand, before being understood."" Having lived my whole life with depression and anxiety, I understand how mental illness makes a person very self centered. When your head is full of loud thoughts, it's hard to focus on the outside world. But remember that you cannot read minds, and to connect with other people and the outside world, you have to let go of your own narrative to empathize with others. It's ok to go out into the world feeling bad. Bring your fear. Maybe think about it like taking it out for a field trip.

&#x200B;

depression,uwm8rs,i9urtjs,"You should feel shame. Thats a human reaction. Its okay to feel the way you do.

We all start building from that place of shame. Identifying how you feel, where you want to be, and the issues you have is important.

What I did, is I took a piece of paper and a pencil. I wrote down what I needed and identified a life that would be okay for me. I picked a career that doesn't require socializing (Information Technology). I picked a significant other that is as awkward as I am. I found a salary that meets my needs and I live under that amount.

Having that paper in my head kept me from worrying about anything else. That nervousness, the anxiety and the judgment around me. I had to be the one that tells me it just doesn't matter, I HAVE TO DO THIS. 

Its taken 5 years to get where I am. But, I am glad I did what I needed to do. 

Your family understands and its okay to rely on help while finding your legs to stand on. Instead of thinking of a burden, invest their energy into something moving forward. Once you see the progress you make, the tangible momentum you can feel after making a step forward. That shame will start to go away and after time  .

It's harder to ignore stuff if you can see it. Couple that with the general public's reluctance about talking about mental illness, and it's no wonder mental health isn't taken seriously.

That doesn't mean it's right, though. I think we've all been hurt at some point by this sort of ignorance. The most we can do is educate, and try to get rid of that stigma. It won't happen over night, but I hope, it will happen someday.",43
depression,23cluc,cgvp469,"I could not agree more.

When I switched my health insurance I did my research and made sure to find one that would cover mental health visits. It was a little more expensive but I'm trying to make sure I'm taking care of myself and am going to be able to see someone and get help. 

So after it kicks in, I do a google search of therapists in my area. Hundreds of names come up all around me. I do a little research, find one I feel like I would be comfortable with and make a call. She calls me back within a few hours and I discover she doesn't take my insurance- the only plan I can afford that covers mental health professionals. She charges $100 a session. Nope. I ask her if she knows how to find out who would be able to take my insurance and she suggests going to my insurance company's website for a list. Okay. I do that and guess how many freaking names pop up? Two. Two people who can possibly help me. Too bad if I'm uncomfortable with them, those are my choices. There are hundreds of therapists in my area that charge an arm and a leg to talk to for an hour and two that are willing to see patients that aren't stupidly wealthy. That's fair. :/ 

I call the one closest to me cause the other one is 40 minutes away and I don't have time to drive that far on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. They take my information. Tell me the last name of the doctor. I ask, what is to me, a very important question: Is the doctor I'll be talking to a male or a female? He's a male. Great. The only doctor within distance that it have the means to see and it's someone I'm never gonna be able to totally open up to. 

Apparently, if you're not wealthy you're not as deserving of help. 

TLDR; Money= better care.",65
depression,23cluc,cgvr2vv,"I agree so much! They way people act towards me when I tell them I struggle with depression & anxiety drives me insane!

I use to be a wrestler. I grew up with a friend who boxed and we'd train with a guy who won Ultimate fighter on TV from a young age. My point is there was a point in my life where I had zero fear of being around people, having everyone watching me, a team depending on my and walking out onto a wrestling mat to face someone one on one with everything I had. 


Now that I have these problems I can't even walk into the store some days to shop. I'll break down freak out, go outside and sit in my car and just cry. Hate myself for not being able to do the most simple of things, things I need to do just to take care of myself and live. They don't get what's that's like at all. 


They don't understand how physically drained I am from my depression. They tell me to just be happy and make the most out of it. My mom has cancer and she's in a remission. I live in fear every day that the same thing is gonna happen to her that happened to my father. Than I'm gonna get that phone call that her cancer's back. Get a phone call that she passed away. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat and just cry from the dreams I have. I've had to call her at 3am just to hear her voice. 

I just moved away after taking care of her for a few years. I also helped her when my father passed away. It was on the 21st of this month, my mothers birthday and It's fucking killing me not being home near her right now. Then looking for a job, dealing with all of these problems and getting no calls back for months is just fucking crushing. 


Sorry for just kinda going off on a rant like that but once I started typing it all just came out. Most of the times I'd write something like this out, kinda feel better and then never post it. But I'm just gonna choose to leave it this time and go from there.

depression,23cluc,cgvp4qi,"Yeah, no one really gives a rats ass and it's sad. I've been dealing with depression for almost a decade on my own. It first started manifesting when I was 13. I was often scolded by my militant family for being ""moody"" and ""insubordinate"", so I said Fuck You and stopped talking to them altogether. I would spend my free time in my room, only coming out to piss or eat. Started taking drugs because I saw it as something fun and exciting that took my normally dark, depressed brain and turned it into a loopy, yet cognitive playplace without depression. Of course, this only lasted as long as the high. Dragged my feet through high school. Have tried numerous times to attend college, university and community. Have not succeeded in finishing a semester yet.. 

But, there is hope! Because recently I have realized, no one is EVER going to see me struggling and say ""Are you depressed? Would you like me to help you out? Be someone you can talk to?"" Not even my gf of 4 years who knows I have depression has said that to me (of course she is there to support me, but I don't expect her to coach me out of a depression that I've had for seemingly my entire life). That's how I know I, and we with mental disorders, need to take initiative for ourselves and tell the world ""I'm hurting. I can't live like this. I need help."" We need to realize we have a problem and it's REAL. For years I've told myself, I'll get better soon. Nope. 

It may not be as visible as a broken bone, but I'd rather have two broken legs and two broken arms with a 'normal' brain, then to have functioning limbs and wake up everyday of my life thinking of ways to disappear. I'm not going to let this control me any long and I'm currently seeking professional help for it. I've been depressed so long, it's become who I am and I fucking hate it.. ",23
depression,23cluc,cgvs5jj,"The problem is that people think about how they would feel in a certain situation. While this type of empathy works with physical ailments, with mental ones,  it doesn't. Its hard to imagine a depressed person as anything other than a drama queen filled with laziness because if they were in that situation they wouldn't be depressed for example.

Demonizing the different has always come so natural to those that were unfamiliar, and with a school shooting almost every week lately we have created a breeding ground of conservatives and concerned parents which are definitely going to bring into question the civil liberties of those with a psychiatric history.

Have your doctor explain why you can't work. Find a lawyer (some law schools have free clinics -- I'm an attorney and my school helped people with depression obtain disability).

I also need to support myself and my family.

The problem is that we do not value emotional and mental health and well-being the way we value physical health.  If mental health is undervalued, it is underfunded.  It is not the fault of the therapist or psychologist, it is the fault of society's stance on what is important.

Further, it's not controlled by big pharma (I grow my own) and thus is significantly cheaper than moving to prescription medications. 

But moderation and occasional ""T"" breaks are crucial. My T breaks last about a week for me to reset my tolerance. Further, I do not let it define me. I've stopped drinking alcohol and instead use a joint, gummy or vape to clear my head at the end of the day.

Still have days where I'm depressed as fuck but that's also more likely to happen if the day before i decided to sleep 6h later than usual, eat junk, skip exercising, procrastinate on work, etc etc etc. And on the days where there is no cause, my antidepressants almost always kick in 2h after i take them and i just...

depression,i2h6dv,g054rva,"That's exactly the reason I did so bad in uni. I was a law student and I actually liked to read, do problem questions and write and I would sit at my computer and have no motivation at all. Now that it's died down a little I try to tell my family that it's way worse than how I'm acting right now and they say stuff like 'I tried to help you and you didn't take my advice'. The thing is I did take their advice but I literally could not do it.",11
depression,i2h6dv,g05ir6t,"Eating properly doesn't make me feel better. I mean, I'm sure in the long run it might make a difference, but the short-term instant gratification of sweets and junk food is often too much to resist, and it actually does make me feel better at the moment of consumption.

Exercising, I don't know, it makes a small difference, but it doesn't really solve my core problems.

Hobbies might help. I'd like to draw more, but as you've mentioned, motivation is a problem.

Honestly, having close friends to talk to on a regular basis would be the best thing for my mental health, but I don't really have any right now.

But yeah, I can 100% relate to the hopelessness bit. I feel a bit hopeless about getting better, although I am trying. Small steps, I suppose...",10
depression,i2h6dv,g05jl2r,"I feel that. The biggest problem with depression is how varied it is. It can be  ephemeral, or lifelong. Triggered by events or simply part of our biology. So what works for someone else might do the opposite for you. Regardless of all that we all know that inability to do anything. 

The spiral is difficult to get out of, putting it lightly. There are these moments of clarity though where we can see ourselves and feel that desire to get out strongly. It's those moments you grasp to and find the strength to keep on trying to get out. You may never be free of it, but you keep building up ways to combat it so you can take action or get the semblance of something better than this. We're all in this together.",10

depression,i2h6dv,g05dquu,"Actually I just wrote something on similar lines a while ago. I have been working out for the past six years. The ostensible reason was to vent cuz of all the shyness but deep down I knew that it actually was a break from people/world for an hour. This was college and this was without adhering to a diet. 

Since corona, I have combined it with a strict diet and I'm making serious progress physically. The developing core makes me feel really good in the mornings, in addition to the hour's workout. But the deal is, mentally, even then, evening onwards depression hits just like it used to. So this hobby actually gives a 2 hour temporary reprieve and nothing more. 

One small yet pertinent change is that maybe my state of mind is mostly the same, yet a small hope of seeing a better, fitter sexier me the next day does reduce that ""why do I even exist"" line of thought. But only a little.",7
depression,i2h6dv,g05yyff,"I really feel this. Last fall my depression was the worst it had been in years. I couldn’t focus on anything, very suicidal, was starting to do poorly in all of my classes, and was no longer being effective at helping others at my internship. I’ll spare you all the fluffy details, but long story short I reluctantly decided to give medication another try. After about a month I was feeling a little better, after two I was feeling the best I had in over a year. It was like something clicked in my brain, and the things my therapist was telling me to do finally made sense. It was like the medication helped reconnect whatever was off in my brain so that I had the energy and motivation to fight my own sick mind and start getting better. Things aren’t perfect now, and I still have bad days, but my life has veeeery slowly gotten better. 

OP I’m in no way trying to invalidate your experience. I’m really sorry that your school’s counselor failed you. I know medication definitely isn’t for everyone, and finding a doctor is hard.

depression,i2h6dv,g064lr4,"Ayup. It's horrible. Also, nobody really understands what causes it yet, and knowing that would really impact how it's treated. What a time to be depressed, frankly.

I just hope I find a drug that helps me some day. I despair of any sort of lifestyle advice, I really do, because it effectively individualises the problem and solution, making me feel at fault if I can't follow it. But that's literally what I need help with in the first place. Doing something good can only ever result in a temporary experience or feeling. It is progress and meaning that a depressed person lacks a feeling for and that seems to be at the core both at the motivational and cognitive level of the disorder. A treatment isn't worthy of that name if it doesn't address the core experience of the problem.

Thanks for the post, OP. I feel less alone. Often I blame myself for every day spent frozen unable to move my body alongside my thoughts, for every smile painfully faked, for every Sisyphean action trying to lifestyle my way out of depression.

depression,i2h6dv,g06b4q4,"I've not read through all the comments. And as I start to write this I wonder if I will actually post this. 

I'm 48 years old. I started struggling with depression when I was in the third grade. I won't go back there. 

My biggest ""aha!"" Moment was when I had gone through so much  therapy (some good some just okay) and was just done.  I talked to my primary doctor and he said ""do you apologize for wearing glasses?"" Of course I don't. And he went on to explain that I had a chemical imbalance. 

He helped me with meds. I had talked and talked to to so many people about my issues. 

My depression has been an old friend, a warm blanket. It is familiar. It is also an unbelievable struggle. It draws you back. 

I want to speak to those of you who are so much younger than my 48 years- life is good. It does get better. Talk about how you feel. Now is better that it was 20 years ago. I can say to my friends ""I was in a bad place"" and they care.  Your friends will too. 

Let me tell you - I didn't think I would live to see my being married with an amazing son. My life that I didn't think had meaning does now. You will find your way. Promise. 

The darkness will come. And sometimes we welcome it. Just for a bit.  Then we gain our strength and we fight it. Life is worth it. If not for us- for the ones that love us.",4
depression,i2h6dv,g05b9jo,"I suffer from r/emotionalneglect. This, amongst others things has caused severe depression.
I’ve seen many therapists since childhood. 
Now that I’m an adult and am more involved in my own treatment, I’ve found that the gold standard type therapies don’t work for me.
CBT, DBT, and mindfulness all feel invalidating. There are other treatment approaches out there and one just has to research. I had absolutely NO IDEA that there was anything besides the gold standard.

depression,i2h6dv,g053agk,"When you have a day when you feel like you can do something, reach out to a medical professional. The feeling of fatigue and struggle to do basic things, in my case, needs medicine to overcome. Caffeine only goes so far. A lot of depression gets worse if untreated, so be proactive while you can.

Since things do take a lot of effort, don't be hard on yourself. Surrender to the fact that you have this thing, it's not your fault you have it, and even if you did manage to do all of the ""outer"" things, it's an ""inner"" issue. Walks, meditation, petting animals, watching comedies, eating well, working out, etc are all great advice, but they don't make a dent in a chemical imbalance. That's why it's important to reach out. All it takes is a couple of phone calls with nice people who want to help. Start there. You can even do that in bed. 


Another thing you can do in bed, which I just started doing, is the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression. It's on amazon, and it's pretty awesome so far. Aside from that, Journaling helps too. Just write all of these feelings and thoughts out as they show up. You don't have to do it everyday, or show anyone, but it's good to get it out of the head and onto a page. Don't expect them to feel easy, make you feel better, or give you any pleasure. Just think of them as beneficial steps to take while you're stuck in a rough place.


A pen, a book, a blank notebook, and a phone call. Those great first steps, don't take much effort, you can do them all with music playing, and they may lead you to a more manageable place. Best of luck! I'm on the same journey.",8
depression,i2h6dv,g0592un,You're absolutely right!,3
depression,i2h6dv,g05ejnc,"This is anecdotal, but you might find it useful idk.

I've had severe depression since I was a kid, i have a very strong genetic predisposition to it, nothing has helped me more than psychedelics and stimulants.

I've had pretty crippling depression for 15 years now, and i can say nothing improved my life more than magic mushrooms and vyvanse.

Long term depression damages your pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus, which can result in ADHD like symptoms. When i was at college i only slept 45 minutes a night because i couldnt focus on my work, all i did was work 23 hours a day and sleep an hour just to not fail. Since getting my stimulant prescription, i now regularly sleep 8+ hours a night because i can actually function, this helped me a lot. No anti-depressant or therapist could have helped me like this.

Also, magic mushrooms reminded me what it felt like to be happy for the first time in years. I tripped once and since then i exercise, got a job, drink water, stopped using any drugs at all, i have hobbies like art  and writing, etc. 

Those two might not work for everyone, nor would i reccomend everyone try psychedelics or stimulants, but for me personally, they helped a lot.

I used to be a blubbery alcoholic, now im fit and healthy looking, i care about my clothes and hygiene, im able to socialize, etc.

Im still very depressed, but im able to do much more than i was before and im very grateful for both of those substances.",3

I am personally trying to take little steps to stress my self less over all and to go back and make fruitful connections with the world again.

depression,i2h6dv,g06vzgb,"Group therapy can be great. I know the counsellor just told you what many might tell you but therapy actually sounds like the right choice. Idk where you live and whether it's affordable but getting better isn't (as you're saying) about knowing what to do and neither is therapy. I mean to some degree it is but I've been in group therapy for years and most people there were very smart and reflective; they did understand their behaviour quite well. Therapy isn't about what you do but about why you do it. I know you might feel like their advice was useless because you barelyanaged to go there but for me it helped a lot. Personally I only went to counselling when I had to redo an exam and I realized on my own I wouldn't get myself to study and then drop out of uni. I needed to get close to failing completely before I could ask for help. Ultimately the only one who can change and heal you is yourself but others can help you a lot on that journey. I think the biggest support from my group therapy to me was having regular appointments and also having other people there that fail just as much as you do. It took at least 2 years but I got to the point where I actually want to make myself better and not just deal with whatever shit is hitting me right now. I've been in therapy for 4 years now and I've gotten a lot better but I still fail regularly and it can be really hard to do anything. I'm not saying this to discourage anyone - I've definitely made a lot of progress overall - I'm just trying to say that the goal shouldn't be to ""just do all those things"" but doing it once. You shouldn't say ""I'm going to go outside for 30mins every day"" but rather ""today I'm going outside for 30 mins"" and do the same thing tomorrow.

depression,i2h6dv,g05iaaa,"Thanks for sharing and I’ve experienced similar challenges. At one point I was in a trance like state in bed about 20 hours a day. Figured either sleep or semi sleep was the best way to avoid reality and in a way time travel. 
And I’ve had multiple therapist, some strict and logical while others were semi spiritual but I’ve found it’s really tough to find someone who will stop and really listen. Therapist usually are trained in one or two methods and see things that way. Recall a cognitive therapist tell me to replace negative thoughts with neutral or positive ones... I agree that actually does work and I grew up learning a similar concept in tennis; avoid negative talk like after making a mistake thinking “I suck!” And replace it with, “sometimes I miss and I can get better...” or something. And I do agree this can work and a lot better than one might assume. Then I told the therapist when I “think” it’s like watching a movie, it’s not always in sentences... There seems to me things that can work for different people so I did really give this cognitive thing a good try for a few weeks. Even though I don’t follow this particular path; I did learn a few things and hey being mindful is a good thing.

I’ll share something that is helping me some and hope it might be some help for someone reading this... also I’ve borrowed from various areas and this is not coming from me; I’m no expert etc.

I try to remember to have gratitude for the day. I can find something positive in my environment and if not; I can cheat and think of my cat (or dog in heaven) and it opens my heart at least for a moment. So then I’m temporarily at least in a neutral state (not negativity). 

Recently I heard or read someone smart who explained that emotions come from the body and we can use our mind to override and force ourselves to do things. And yes I experience what I call the black hole that pulls me to bed and I want to lay down, feeling so tired like I ran two marathons and just be there waiting for time to pass. Time will pass and the guilty will kick in or I’ll find a way to temporarily distract myself with cleaning the house or music or a documentary (avoid news omg). 

Another phrase that seemed to help me is action comes before motivation. I always assumed you had to be feeling it before you do something. Whatever it is you choose to do; just show up and do it even if you feel like crap and feel like you suck. I’ve discovered I can draw and draw for hours; hey at least it passes the time but then again there are times I think, drawing and cleaning the house every day is not a living hell but I still feel stuck but at least less stuck than laying in bed.

I struggle with all of this because of my personal history and over the years I have become isolated and after being alone for years and not having anyone that actually wants to hear your opinions or ideas; I start to question if I exist; I mean sure I can wear a social mask and small talk but I don’t know how to explain it. It’s something like, if I have an interesting (to me) thought and no one hears it, does it really exist or matter? 
Lots of challenges; depression and anxiety are invisible and most regular people assume your lazy etc. personally I really struggle with motivation. 

Maybe not the best way to end but I do try and figure out what is going on deep inside? Am I like this from dysfunctional patterns from childhood, genetic, bad choices in life? Maybe after I lost my job? In a way I wish I could be like the collective and eat sleep work and watch tv and feel fulfilled... 

I’m glad I found your post! It’s really tough to talk about this stuff and I’ve noticed my family kind of would rather not hear my darkest thoughts.

I feel like ther's just no place for me here, it's all pointless. I can't find a single hobby that would be even slighly interesting.

I got prescribed most of these by a psychiatrist and the rest in a psych ward. Now im on 300 mg wellbutrin because SSRIs and SNRIs were not working long term and i was gaining excessive weight (i was 115 lbs when i was 18, before meds. I am now 21 and nearly 150) along with having no sex drive, night sweats, worsening depression. I am not taking any other meds besides trazodone to sleep.

I got on the wellbutrin 2 and a half weeks ago and am not noticing any difference but im also withdrawing from kratom so that doesnt help my case any since kratom messes with your dopamine levels massively. If this doesnt work, i feel like my only option for meds left is tricyclics or MAOI or whatever theyre called inhibitors, and those have an abundance of side effects that im certain are worse than SSRI and SNRI meds.

depression,i2h6dv,g06xir5,"Yes, this!  I wonder how much of our depression/anxiety could be described as c-ptsd.  It really fits  for me.  But it’s not even a valid diagnosis in America.

I’m (now) doing my best to be a loving parent to myself.  
I guess the most important part of that is listening to my feelings, validating them, which... I think sets me up to take self-interested action to make things better in the future.  

This is a huge struggle for me.  I can’t even get myself to ice my swollen ankle.

I have a hard time listening to and validating my feelings.  I learned early on that my feelings, my pain, my inner “sparks” or callings, didn’t matter.  In order to survive/achieve, I learned/was unintentionally taught this.  I got twisted.

My inner 2 year old is freaking done with doing anything until she gets the validation she’s been seeking her whole life.  And it’s challenging to find the energy to lovingly reparent my inner self, let alone the right techniques.  My inner child needs therapeutic parenting from me, and my parenting skills are a mess because that’s how I got this way.

Richard Grannon (YouTube) is helping.

For me, that means plenty of encouragement for the things I have to do.  “You can do it.  You can just put away 5 things and stop.  Good job brushing your teeth!” etc.  I’m trying to respond to the baby/child inside me.",2

Day2: woke up without sense of dread but everything is still grey
Day4: stupid productive feel good day
Day5: minor ""manic"" day (not diagnosed bipolar but my psych has touched on possibility a couple times), while depression= irritably low mood, uncontrollable high mood is just as terrifying
Day9-13: i hate the world + daylight savings
+3mo: made my psychiatrist proud of me for i have absolutely no idea what.

So, pretty fast timeline for me, plus i on a performance improvement plan a week after a 2 month leave for depression so I was running on a lot of fear as ""motivation"" to not get fired. And honestly, while I personally didn't feel much of a difference, the fact that roommates, coworkers, and friends all commented on it means that they were definitely working.

Everyone is different but I'm also on Wellbutrin and that helped a lot with the ""just kill me now"" feeling when you first wake up. Lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and to decrease seizure risk, then since my anxiety is mostly physical and not mental, propranolol was the difference between dreading meetings to actively participating in them.

I also found medication timing to be pretty important, and on days i sleep in or forget to take something +-3h i feel like absolute shit.

depression,i2h6dv,g0mvudw,"I really felt what you wrote. In my case I know my depression was triggered by physical problems, but these are treated now, yet the depression stayed. It is the trauma that remains and keeps being reignited and relived. And it is trauma from childhood as well as from that period of illness. I myself learned in childhood that the only thing to do with a problem, dilemma, worry, mistake or emotion was to feel ashamed of it, put up with it and try to ignore it, and so that was what I did with all my problems. Needless to say it's turned out badly.

I agree that being loving towards the self helps to support decisions that honour and care for one's future self, and thank you for writing about that because it's always useful to feel that reinforced from somebody else. If you aren't fighting your feelings, you can use that energy to address them constructively.

depression,i2h6dv,g06bcjs,"Thank you so much! As if the mental health wasn’t enough to live with, we also have the stigma shadow eternally following us.

When the subject of being “normal” comes up...

We do our best to function in a society that makes it feel shameful to have a chronic existing condition because it can’t be visually seen.

She happily snuggled against me on the worst of days & the best of ones as well. She gave me all of her love & kindness everyday for 12 yrs. I am thankful that she will be wherever I am or whatever home is... I chose to have her cremated & I hope to feel a sense of closure. My heart & our home feels a empty, I hope having her back fills that empty.. it may not be wholesome but I’ll know she’s here.

depression,i2h6dv,g0c31ol,"You have to understand that if it gets worse, you will have no luxury to be picky. You also have to understand that depression has a side effect profile just like medication, and has black box warning of suicide tendencies. How is that not worse than medication? We can't help you if youre dead. Secondly you are like a node in a network and your depression does affect those nearby they just hide it well just like you hide depression well to not drag you/them down.

You think most patients that go in for help arent sceptical of therapy and medication? Most people do. 
When i my anxiety was increasingly worse because of neglect and not getting help, after the few years it turned to panic attacks and agoraphobia. At that point the thought of my panic attacks getting EVEN worse was more scary than the panic attack of going outside after calling the psychiatrist.

I was afraid of side effects so i cut the pill into small quarters and took increasingly bigger bits and by day 5 i realized i had no side effects. None at all. 

At week 3-4 i noticed i could go to grocery store without getting nauseous from anxiety. I didnt overthink anymore and the feeling of being watched was gone. Even if i bumped into a friend, such interaction would scare and put me off but now there was ... No anxiety at all.

It took some time to get used to feeling..normal. anxiety was the normal for me all my life so for the first time have none of the constant white loud noise in my head was so weird. I started wanting social interaction which i never did before in my life. Without the anxiety i could actually enjoy the interactions.

As for addiction, only very few drugs are addictive, like Adderall and ritalin because they produce euphoria. Who wouldn't enjoy the feeling good? But these are not antidepressants, most such drugs are illegal. So antidepressants are not euphoric at all and are not recreational. No one takes antidepressants the way you take recreational drugs to get high. Theres no high or euphoria at all. Im saying this as recovering addict.
 The only drug that is easily accessible and produce dependence are benzodiazepines. You could say you will refuse benzos because of dependence potential thats it. Benzos are not really enjoyable but are great anxiety killers. They're not antidepressants.

As for dependence of antidepressants, they unlike drugs of abuse, last a very long time before they're metabolised. This makes it easy to avoid any issues of dependence.

depression,i2h6dv,g0cpdi6,"First, thank you for the elaborate reply! 

It seems like a dream that just taking medicine could take all this anxiety and negative thoughts away. I think I was a bit prideful, like 'I can do this by myself, I don't need help or medicine, nothing will help anyways.' I don't like the idea of taking medicine every day, but as you said that is a luxury. 

I guess I'm also scared of changing. I've always been the way I am; shy, anxious, gloomy, silent and withdrawn. I'm scared of becoming someone else. Even if that is a major improvement. Weird huh. 

But truth is, I've just been sinking deeper and deeper, and I'm a huge burden on those around me. I've been dealing with my depression in the most unhealthy of ways, because I thought I had tried everything. I just was never willing to try medication. I've already got an addiction (not drugs related) so don't want to add more. 

All I've ever heard from people around me (and here on reddit) is how medication either didn't do anything, or was very addictive, or had nasty side effects (it gave this girl I know terrible tics, permanent). I'm known to be very sensitive to even the lightest doses of medicine, and have had some pretty nasty side effects in the past, which is why I'm so apprehensive. 

But that's why I'm thankful to read about someone's positive experience for once. And you're right, if I'm already suffering, why not try the medication? I'm done with feeling this way and I think this was the wake up call I needed. It's the last and only thing I haven't tried yet.

I had exact same thing, however when anxiety and the agonizing miser of laying in bed all day staring at the ceiling got increasingly worse, i couldnt do that anymore and cry in a shower every day. I dragged myself anyway, regardless of my mental temper tantrums and beliefs, some part of me just knew this is what I HAVE to do, not think, just DO.

 Next >*nothing will help anyways* 

You dont know that. especially since you havent tried not a single of the bunch of different antidepressants and not a single psychotherapist trained to help people exactly like you and me.

 If for example theoretically, the second or even first antidepressant you will try will be perfect fit for you and reduced 90% of your depression - its sitting right there for grabs, available, but you dont know it even existss and suffer needlesly.. 

You have to look at depression as a evil conspiracy, a downward spiral where it tries to drag you down by pushing your buttons. With depression it pushes thoughts in your head like notorious ""its not bad enough yet to warrant asking help"" which is bullshit, because once it festers inside you for long enough it has roots deep down in your psyche and is extremely hard to get rid of. 

Treating it as soon as possible prevents it from manifesting from mild depression to moderate depression to severe depression and then suicidal tendencies and selfdestrucction. You would wait until the last stage to get help? I dont think standard methods will work anymore at that stage.. which is very unfortunate.

Remember it takes a month at least for AD to kick in, so if youre very skeptical, give it a try for a month and quit if you dont like it. Since the concentration of the AD rises gradually each day, you dont actually feel it kicking in, and even after a month where its working, you may feel absolutely the same. However thats when you are supposed to really analyze past 7 days vs before starting the AD. Thats when you will notice big differences here and there simply because of how very gradually the AD is kicking in, so theres no sudden change in wellbeing. 

It doesnt make you happy, it just makes you less depressed, especialy less anxious since most ADs are mildly sedating. There are completely different ones if the first one doesnt work. For example bupropion is absolutely different, and not sedating, its pure stimulant that  may increase anxiety in people with anxiety disorders, but very helpful for melancholic lethargic depression as it gives you energy and motivation. 

*> I guess I'm also scared of changing. I've always been the way I am;*  

I was too, but i became even more scared of getting worse, wasting life opportunities and my youth and never experience true life and the pleasures of the best years of my life. After 20 years you will be even more shy and anxious, but much more miserable because of what i just mentioned. Its very depressing state to be in. Imagine if you got help and it worked, your depression is almost all gone, now as your future self, look back to your current self, and think of what would your future self (not as shy and more outgoing) think and say to your current self? Do you think your future self wasnt scared of change? :D he was. but did it anyway.

When my AD was working fully at 2 months in, i remember being upset that i didnt get help sooner, because i spent my childhood and teenage years absolutely isolated, introverted with panic attacks and agoraphobia. It was very sad life, that was..avoidable:(

  ***>I'm scared of becoming someone else*** 

Now think back of that future version of yourself, he's better and not as shy, most of the time not depressed anymore and outgoing. This IS someone else, this version of you is different, but in a very positive way. If i gave you a cure for depression, would you be scared of becoming someone else? someone else being YOU without depression and anxiety. You should be scared of not becoming someone else, but of staying the same for years to come. 

ADs dont change your personality. You are still yourself, man. And you FEEL yourself. Its usually antipsychotics that numb emotions so much people become a shell of themselves.  But when you dont have anxiety anymore and feel more upbeat and less depressed, you do act differently, right? but in a positive way. You shouldnt be afraid of becoming someone else, because 9times/10 that someone else would be in a better position than your current self even if picked randomly. You are scared of making things worse, not scared of change. But most people that come in to psychiatrist have exact same fears and take a while to talk them into finally trying antidepressants, and then them being sour that they waited so fucking long, so much needless suffering...

***> I'm a huge burden on those around me*** 

Even more of a reason to get psychiatrist. If not for you, for them. You will feel better when you know you arent a burden anymore to them and they arent hiding their bitterness for you.

***> 've been dealing with my depression in the most unhealthy of ways,***  

Proof that you have to hand over the care of you to someone else, who is trained to help people exactly like you. You wouldnt believe how common your state is in other depressed people that come in. Let someone trained to take care, as you are choosing wrong ways of treating yourself and make it all worse. There are people that WANT to help you, really.

\>  ***I've already got an addiction (not drugs related) so don't want to add more.*** 

Your addiction (to sugar?) is very very likely just a coping mechanism of selfmedicating your depression and anxiety. Antidepressants as i said are not addictive in the same sense and you can quit tapering without having any discomfort. Secondly, since AD will treat you depression and especially anxiety, you will have less of the desperation to cope and selfmedicate the depression away. SSRI antidepressants definitely help with anxiety, but not always with depression, atleast not as much as anxiety. However if depression is worsened by anxiety, the relief of anxiety will relieve depression. I assure you, you will be much calmer mentally with ADs and not need caffeine and sugar to reduce sufffering",2

Because i accepted at that point, i didn't have the luxury to be choosy anymore. Suicidal depression is serious matter and theres no time to fiddle and hesitate on to try or not to try antidepressants. .
It took 5 weeks when it kicked in and I stopped having panic attacks completely. I had to get used to not having anxiety in usual scenarios and places.
I was afraid to try tho and didnt take my meds first week. Then i took small crumbles of the pill. Each time bigger size of a piece until at day 10 i took the whole pill.

Also, I'm not addicted to sugar lol I'm addicted to porn it's really fucked me up. (might also be addicted to sugar but who isn't right?) Maybe porn isn't classified as a 'real' addiction? I don't know but it is my go to coping mechanism and I can't stop. That and starving myself are the only things that make me feel something. I feel pathetic to rely on something else (like porn or antidepressants) to be able to live my life. But if I think of antidepressants like medication for an illness (which it is right?) there's nothing to be ashamed about. I just had these stupid misconceptions all this time.

depression,i2h6dv,g0l45fu,"Is your issue depression moreso or anxiety? Btw you have to understand there are very different ADs and trying two of the same ssri class does not mean they're all like that. Perhaps serotonin is not the issue for you? Ssris indeed have a characteristic of numbing emotion extremes. If youre in constant anxiety, the numbing is godsend. 

If venlafaxine wasnt working after 6  months whyy would you keep taking it for 3 years? There are a few options to try that are much different.

Bupropion is a stimulant (NDRI) and since it has nothing to do with serotonin it does not have the loss of libido and emotion numbing. Bupropion is actually taken alone or addded onto ssri to reverse these two main symptoms, especially the libido Anorgasmia and excessive sleepiness.
It wont numb you. It may increase anxiety if youre sensitive to anxiety but if you can drink a strong coffee you will be fine with this.

Next option would be MAOIs. Selegiline, rasagiline. They inhibit monoamine oxidase and result in increase of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine (this one is the main neurotransmitter responsible for motivation and mood) that's why all euphoriant drugs are directly or indirectly dopaminergic.

Taking ssri alone unfortunately reduces dopamine release thats why motivation and libido suffers. You have to stimulate serotonin and dopamine. It's pushing too much to one side if its just each alone. However dopamine is more important for mood than serotonin. Purely serotonin increasing drugs are not enjoyable AT ALL. 

You shoud get L-tyrosine, 5-htp and b vitamins as well. Also DL-phenylalanine.

On motivation to pursue therapy - you'd know better than me, but I had thought the evidence for CBT improving outcomes for depression was fairly strong. So just as your patients should follow your recommendations on testing, meds, lifestyle changes, etc., pursuing therapy is just following the evidence in the same way that you do when you care for your patients. 

And unless you present some kind of very specific threat to yourself or others, my understanding is that your condition/diagnosis is confidential and can't affect your job. Personally I do think some discretion is appropriate and (unless you need immediate assistance at a higher level of care) it makes sense to clarify that any SI is only passive SI.

There are times where I'm like hey I'm triggered or about to be triggered, I need to leave this space. This is usually in public but it's not often and simply getting away and meeting back up a few minutes later I'm fine. 

We recently had something happen and in the big picture it's a nothing burger. Although due to my trauma it has been a very troubling situation for me. My wife is educated on how to help me with my attacks but refuses to learn or go any deeper than that. 

This time around she got very angry with me and my stepdaughter joined in. The situation that caused all this is no single person's fault and the blame can't be put on anyone. If anyone needs to step up and say yes, it's my fault, it would be my stepdaughter. But it's just so stupid to begin with it's not a big deal. 

So I've been so stressed over this that I lost a whole day. It was just a few hours ago I realized it was Friday. So basically I'm being called selfish and I make everything about me. Anytime they need me I start having an attack. This is very far from the truth and my attacks have nothing to do with things they do, it has to do with past experiences. 

I tried talking to her and she said I have no right to be having an attack over this or really any other time ever. She fully invalidated my diagnosis and I'm still having an attack and I can't really process it. She can literally calm me down in minutes but she is choosing to make me suffer and call this all an act and say I'm choosing to isolate myself. 

Well when I go out there all they do is yell at me because I'm having an attack and can't stop breathing heavy, shaking, jerking, and having other physiological reactions to the things they are doing. 

So we are in the same boat here on that note. I think your wife will be much more open to a little talk than mine is. I see she is a medical professional, it shouldn't take much to show her your hobbies are your outlets, that is keeping you sane. That's a luxury I don't have. You have to heal and be at a certain level before you can switch to the next gear. Me time for me is me being selfish and invalidating everyone else's feelings somehow. I don't know how coming home from work, cleaning the house, playing GTA for 30 minutes while she is working is bothering anyone. 
Guess I should have cleaned again instead?

- I think your wife is partially right. If you can consistently enjoy your hobbies (not just a little, but very much) and have no issues in pursuing them, but fail to do other things the feeling of depression is situational which is not indicative of MDD. That is just labelling, there is probably something else wrong. 
- Did you consider that she could be right?

- You seem to feel not adequately appreciated.  Yet you see the responsibility of raising your son as your wife's although both of you have a demanding career.

After years of pondering this same thing, I think the answer lies in social activity. BUT WAIT don’t panic. I don’t mean the stereotypical bullshit like dates and bars and concerts - environments that highly social people thrive in. I’m talking about things like clubs, soup kitchens, volunteer work, participating (not just attending) in local festivals and events, and other tame types of things where there’s not an expectation to be a social butterfly. 

I firmly believe if you aren’t willing to at least do the above then you have to just look inward and accept that partnership with someone is simply not going to happen and you have to find happiness in your own company shame-free. The classic type of scenario like bumping into your soul mate at the grocery store is never, ever, going to happen. You have to at the very least put yourself out there and do something to find a partner. It doesn’t feel fair but it’s a fact of life I’ve come to terms with.",2

Without them, I feel utterly no happiness whatsoever now. I feel nothing at all, except depression. They were like an archangel that could vanquish my depression.

The worst that could happen is you stay apart, which you already are. The best that could happen is you get to be with the one person who makes you happy.

Being ugly is a loss of chance in every aspect of life. If you weren't as handsome, your situation would just be worse, period. People would not consider your feelings or treat you any better if you were average looking, even the opposite if you were actually perceived as ugly.



Your depression is valid. Having one thing that you think goes well in your life doesn't make your depression ""less valid"". People will always say ""you can't be depressed because you are handsome/are rich/have friends/…"" and whatnot, but it's because they don't know what depression is rather than anything else. If you weren't handsome, they'd just pick another fallacy to invalidate your depression.",4

depression,1du4cft,lbfbqbp,"It really depends. For some, strict meant a specific bedtime, specific mealtimes, specific chores, etc. 

For others, like myself, ""strict"" meant horrid patterns of abuse, followed by intense periods of lovebombing, which inevitably lead to more abuse, essentially creating its own self-contained positive feedback loop. 

For myself, it has induced an intense fear of abandonment, rejection, invalidation of my feelings, wants and needs, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I was not to be seen nor heard. I was to be the servant child that was only released from his (literal) cage when chores needed to be done. At all other times, I was locked in my room, with a feeding slot etched into the door, metal bars on the windows, and a bucket for me to use the toilet.

As for advice, unfortunately I’m not great at that but one thing that helps me a bit is just being outside. Usually I’ll go for a walk but when I don’t have the energy to, just sitting in the sun for a bit energises me somehow and clears my head. Idk it that works for you or if you’ve already tried it but it’s all I’ve got lol. 
I think going back to school is a good idea. If you’re not passionate about what you’re doing, I think you should definitely have a change. As for the stress, I’ve heard nursing school is horrible for stress but if it’s something you’re passionate about I think at the end it’ll be more beneficial for you to do it. And if you end up feeling overwhelmed you can study part time and take it slow so it’s less of a strain on your mental health. I think it might also give you something else to do which could help with your depression a bit. 
Again, I’m not too sure if my advice helps that much but really just wanted to let you know how amazing it is that you’ve been given another opportunity at life and, even though I don’t know you, I’m proud that you’ve decided to take it :)

depression,dkx9yc,f4ll8ii,"Question: have you done any blood work to see if everything is okay? Do you have any health issues?

I have experienced severe depression, and treating it only with psychiatric and psychological help was not improving my life. After quite a few doctors I discovered that I have some health issues (inflammation and nervous system issues) that are messing with my ability to absorb nutrients and I need to supplement my diet. Since I started taking my vitamins and supplements, I have way more energy and it’s easier to get motivated to do things.

Another thing to get more energy is opening your windows. Get at least 20 minutes of sun light everyday. If you live somewhere where this is not an option, I have heard you can find some lights that do the same thing to improve your mood.

This is a big one: start meditating. This is something that people dismiss as new age bs, and as a skeptical person it took me a while to try. I recommend you to listen to a podcast called “You are not so smart, Episode 061 - mindfulness” to learn about the science behind meditation, and how can it can improve your life. A major thing is that it helps you to concentrate, and depression usually messes up your executive function so you need to regain this ability.

I recommend listening to the podcast as a whole. It talks about behavior and the many bias that we hold, and many times I had great personal insights while listening to it. The other day I wrote a post about positivity bias based on this podcast, feel free to read it if you want. 

I also realized that I need to keep my priorities straight. I used to spend way too much time reviving traumatic moments and thinking about issues out of my control, and one day I said “fuck it”. Note that this took me a while to figure out, but I decided that I just need to work with the circumstances I have instead of feeling bad about it. “Everything is going to be okay” is my new mantra when bad thoughts get in my mind.

Also get a bullet journal. Learn how it works, it’s super helpful to be productive and to see the progress you are making. Write down every single task you accomplished. If even taking a bath is a big deal, put it as a task. Don’t write down too many things at once, slow and steady is the way to go.
One thing that I find interesting about bullet journals is that some tasks just drag themselves, and this is your chance to evaluate if you even need to do it in the first place. It’s a great way to think about your own life and goals. If something needs to be done but you are avoiding it, it’s an opportunity to ask yourself why you are avoiding it. Basically, it’s a way to get some perspective on your life.",31

For me its the small things. I cling to them from one moment to the next. When I resolved that I was going to recover that's what I started doing. Pretty view outside the window? Revel in it.

If you think nursing school might make you happy, then go for it! And don’t be afraid to take on a lighter load then recommended by whatever school/program you look into.

It is OKAY to take on less, it will make it easier and less intimidating for you while still giving you something to work towards.

Exercise: 
- yoga for calming and breathing, get the inner energy moving
- running or active for amping up getting your endorphins pumping
- dance for both

Food:
- cut meat: eat death, feel like death
- cut dairy: heavy
- cut fried: foods: cancer
- cut sugar: takes energy away from you to even digest it, dates and date paste are a great replacement
- add fruits: gives healthy sugars slowly to sustain energy over time 
- add chia seeds: “chia” known in ancient Egypt as “strength” they thought chia seeds gave supernatural powers. Better energy levels from my experience.
- add dark leafy greens: my fave combo is mango and kale, kale is FULL of magnesium, this is going to calm your cells and actually heal your body as it is digested. 
- add veggies: bleh, it’s hard but they will make you feel better with all the added nutritional support
- add B supplement: this is going to help clear brain fog
- add healthy fats like avocado and olive oil: these are going to help you sustain stable energy levels
- add quinoa: protein source of complete nutrition 
- add water: get about a gallon a day of pure water, remineralized RO water or spring water.

Activities:
- Go outside even if it is cold and be with the elements, notice how the sun is warm, the wind flows through the trees, the birds sing, if you can put your bare feet into grass or soil, stretch out your limbs as if waking up from a deep rest.
- Do something creative, write a poem, draw a mandala, dance. Just do something to express what you are feeling on the inside.
- Chant/mantra: find a few words that help you get through harder moments: “I am love” “I am worthy” “I am capable” say whatever you need in that moment.
- Meditation: just sit with your feelings and body and mind and allow yourself a break from stimulation, yoga helps the sitting position not be so hard and heavy, a little yoga goes a long way, a little meditation goes a long way. 

No one can tell you what the next steps are, nursing school is for you to decide, only you know what is right.

I managed to get help got on medication, got therapy, and changed my life.  I still right depression but I'm no longer fighting it unarmed. 

Some things I learned:
1.  Medication is just part of the battle.  The medication helps stabilize you  so you can fight it.  It will not cure you.  To beat it you have to change the way your mind works. It's simple to say to change how yoiur mind works but it is very very very very hard thing to actually do.  I have been working on doing it for 22 years and it's still a battle but I'm getting good at it.
2. Something I learned from going to AA meetings.  Break your time up into smaller chunks.  If it's to hard to get through the week stop trying and go is on the day.  Tell yourself you made it though yesterday so you can make it through today. Tomorrow doesn't matter.  If a day is to long go by hours, minutes, or seconds.  Go as small as you need too.  
3. Strart lying to yourself set up a repeating saying in your head to conteract that voice in your head that is telling you that you are worthless. Start telling yourself ""I am worth while. I am beautiful, I am.... whatever. This is easier to do at the beginning of a down slide to stop it than to use it to dig yourself out once you on the bottom.  I don't care that you don't believe it. Just keep saying it. Keep repeating it.  The earlier you start it on a down slide the better your chance of stopping it.",2

depression,dkx9yc,f4si2uc,"Came across your post & it is a miracle that you're still here. You're truly blessed & I hope by sharing my experience with depression can help.

Having being diagnosed with major depressive disorder 10 years ago, I have learned ways that worked for me to manage the disorder. It still affects me today especially during Oct-Feb during the darker & colder months of the year but I've gotten better & better to manage it. At the earlier stages of my depression, I was on anti-depressants (mylan-paroxetine) coupled with CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for a couple years. Then I got off of the meds, tried cannabis, micro-dosing, alcohol. It all masked the suffering but never really made me feel better naturally. Developed gout due to my physical inactivity & poor diet, which led me to naturopathic ways to heal my gout (taking indomethacin & allopurinol was only a temporary solution). Surprisingly, by finding solutions to my gout, I discovered ways to alleviate some of the symptoms of depression. This is what worked for me & by no means it's medical advice. Through research of other people's experiences, documentaries on Netflix, reading books by doctors who practice naturopathic forms of medicine, I have found a temporary solution to manage my depression. 

1) Flush out my intestinal tracks (most disease begins within the gut)

    a. via colon cleanse or coffee enemas

        i. when I first administered the coffee enemas,  parasites & unrecognizable matter were  

    released. I do coffee enemas weekly. (research: Gerson therapy).

    b. drinking alkaline water ph 9.5, with high oxidation reduction potential (change your water, change your life)

        i. it assists in keeping your intestinal tracks healthy & lubricated & free of fecal matter

            a. Research Kangen water machine & watch ""Dr. Hiromi Shinya's"" clip on Youtube

 2) Changed my diet to more plant-based 

    a. fresh fruits & vegetables keep the body alkaline (disease cannot grow in an alkaline environment)

        i. As of 2019, jan-mar I ate a meat diet. Went on a vegetarian diet from apr-aug. Then ate meat again from     

        sep-oct. Noticed that my moods & depressive symptoms were more present during the meat eating         

        months. (watch ""Dr. Sebi"" clips on Youtube)

         ii. I have now switched back to a plant-based diet (read ""The China Study by Dr. Colin & Thomas Campbell)

    b. juicing organic fruit & vegetables

        i. assists in keeping the body alkaline, which I believe helps with my depression. when my body gets too

        acidic, depressive symptoms reappear. (watch ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" on Netflix)

3) Physical Activity, Exercise, Walks

    a. leave your residence & do something physical once a day, walking around the block counts (promotes ""feel good"" chemicals in your body)

    b. playing sports helps me with a support network

4) Meditation & Practice Gratitude

    a. guided / unguided meditations helps slow down the ""monkey mind"" & promotes deep breathing. Helps alleviate the chatter in the mind.

    b. meditation apps or youtube works for me

    c. write in a gratitude journal 3-5 things you're grateful for daily (first thing I do every morning)

5) Understand your Life Purpose

    a. read ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" by Dr. Brian Weiss (may help in discovering life's purpose, reason's why we're here, & how life works)

6) Travelling

    a. during the toughest months (Oct-Nov), I like to plan a vacation to a sunny destination.

7) Light Therapy

    a. considering buying a light therapy lamp as it assists with SAD (seasonal affective disorder).

8) Ayahuasca Retreats

    a. considering to do these type of retreats (watch ""The Last Shaman"" on Netflix )

In conclusion, I'm a strong believer that disease starts within the gut & what we consume and put in our body has a significant influence on our mental health. A flush of the intestinal tracks is necessary to give my body & mind a reset; it has made me feel better & my body has been responding well to this. Then I focus on keeping my intestines clean by drinking alkaline water & eating more of a plant-baed diet. I'm considering a ""spiritual / mental flush"" which supposedly can be done through Ayahuasca Retreat. I have not tried it, however, there are many positive testimonials on this via Youtube, Netflix, & some literature on this that favours alleviating depression. Journalizing has helped me keep track of what's worked & what hasn't. Hope this helps in discovering what works for you. There's a way to get better & I believe you will discover it. Much love my friend! ",2

depression,dkx9yc,f4kg3pv,"1) Okay... so, I do not think that you did survive a 200kph crash.  I am not calling you a liar in the sense there was no crash.... but the speed at which your internal organs crush against your rib cage is around 70kph.  I am guessing you glanced off the side, hence the number of spins.

Why do I make that distinction?  Why do I bother.... because depressed people (and manic people and people with similar problems) they like their own legends and lies.  First thing that I found helps me in my own depression is honesty with myself and others.  By creating extraorinary situations and inhabiting them, it seems to feed the mental problems, I do not know why.

2) Second thing that has helped me... and all my things, that help me, might not do a damn thing for you.  Depression manifests itself so differently in people and what works for one, does not work for the other.  Second thing that has helped me.... acceptance.  Accepting both the illness itself and the limitations it imposes on me.

I skim read your post.  It left me utterly breathless and without energy.  Crashes, scans, ECT, CBT, coounsellors, pills, wasting life, how do I do this, how do I do that, conquer!!!

You always seem to be doing something, to beat this!  No wonder you are highly strung.  

You need to accept that your depression is a part of you.  It will probably always be there.  To eliminate the depression you will have to eliminate yourself - which is what you tried to do.  I once had a friend say that to me... ""If I cannot beat this depression, then I would rather die"".  Really?  It is easier to end your life than accept yourself, warts and all?

The depression is not some ""other"" illness you can eliminate.  It is a part of you and your brain, sit down and slow down and start to accept that.  And if you cannot you will be locked into this endless mania of war and stress and trying to overcome something that, in my experience, is not overcomable.

3) Someone proposed weed and was shot down by another user (u/imuselessgarbage and u/Kuteket).  I use weed.  It can help to take the edge off of a very stressful day.  But it has to be low strength, it can make some people worse (especially if it turns out you are schizophrenic, I am not saying you are, but sometimes that stuff comes out later) and it can also make you more anxious if abused.  It can help, but has to be handled with care.

4) Right.... let's have a look at your questions....  I will answer for what is true for me...

**How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?**

I do not.  And I could not without medication or self-medication with stimulants.  If you have low energy, you have low energy.  It will pass.  Hole up, make yourself comfortable, make sure you are living a healthy life if you can manage it.  Do not beat yourself up if you cannot.  It will pass.  All things pass.

By not accepting it and fighting it.... you increase stress and the chances of having a breakdown and doing something like attempting suicide.

**How can I keep up or have more energy?**

See above.

**I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)**

Again I am answering for myself.... I spent a long time considering becoming a nurse.  It is a good fit for some of my skillset....  I rejected it.  Want to know why?  You feel like shit.  Have no energy.  Financially you are not paid enough and overworked.  You have been dragging your arse to work for a few months. Your house is a mess and you are struggling to cook and clean yourself.  Then one day, at work, someone dies in front of you.... Maybe you are a nurse in an elderly ward, so it was expected.  Maybe you are a trauma nurse or a paediatric nurse.... how will you deal with that?  Nurses also have to keep calm and make good professional decisions.  When I am depressed I make mistakes.  When I am depressed I can get emotional.

For me... nursing, ultimately, was a no.  Maybe for you it will be different.  But if you are just coming off the back of a suicide attempt and are still trying to get the monkey off your back and slay that dragon... maybe you are not in the right place to make a good decision on that, for now.

**What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression**

There are various things.  They can be boiled down to living like a Shoalin monk.  Eat well.  Get out of your flat once a day.  Listen to podcasts when you feel lonely, so that you hear another voice and distract your mind.  Exercise if you can. Etc.

But you also have to accept that whatever coping strategies you put in place.... one day there will be a depression that sweeps it all away.  A fucking tsunami that flattens you.  You have to know what depression is, you have to realise you do not always win.... and that is okay.  Sometimes crawling into bed, drawing the curtains and ignoring your phone, accepting the depression *IS WHAT IS NECESSARY*.  You did not lose... you are just strategically not fighting to preserve your mind and strength.

**Any secret self-help/feel good tips?**

You will find your own.

**How do I make more friends and build a better support network?**

That is a toughie.... there are no secrets there and it will be your experimenting that finds that answer for you.

**What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?**

Sounds like you have some support network.  Tell them you suffer from depression.  Do not hide it.  Be truthful.  Where is the shame in saying you have this thing? This goes back to the original thing I said...  What destroys darkness is light.  You start to lie to people.... you think they do not know?  That they cannot see?  You are only lying to yourself.  That helps the depression... ""Lie, they cannot know, all you need is a day and you will be back on your feet....  You do not want them to worry, do you?  Or think you are weak?  Maybe they will stop calling... because who wants to deal with a depressed mental person?... Etc"".  That voice, that impulse is the depression.  It is trying to isolate you and create conditions where it is in control.

Just be honest.... ""Where have you been these last few days u/shibatoucher?"".... ""Ah, sorry, I was a little depressed, well... a lot actually, been struggling"".  Some people will be awkward that you told them, will, maybe, avoid you as they do not know what to say.  Fuck them, that is their problem (and their right, actually).  Do not let it bother you.  You are you.  The good bits and the bad bits.  You got enough on your plate without worrying about what other people think...  

The way I reach stability (not happieness, it is unrealistic to want to be happy all the time, you want contentment and stability) is not with pills and potions and routines and tricks and tips.... it is by accepting myself, accepting this is a part of me, accepting that I will not always control it, when it is in control putting myself in a safe place and waiting it out, being kind to myself and realising that I have limitations because of this thing.

A lot of the stress you feel is because you have something that you think is not you, that you need to war against, that you need to defeat and if you do not defeat it, then that is not acceptable and evidence that you are a failure who is probably better off dying now.

Okay.... and you are struggling, you say?  Well, maybe if you could slow down and take stock of things... you might see that you are ramping up the stress and anxiety and the negativity by being in a state of war with yourself 24/7.  It is a small window you gave me here... and I may have read some things wrong... by even that small window is tiring to look through, fuck knows what it is like to live it.

Good luck, whether I have helped or not.... good luck, I want the best for you and no more suicide attempts.  Please.",4
depression,dkx9yc,f4kxvm9,"Wow! That is definitely a sign. Sorry for poor formatting but my tips. Nursing will definitely make your life more stressful. It's rate one of the most stressful positions out there. If you're not feeling passionate about it (and it's not just the depression) I highly recommend against it. As for your friends, tell them the truth but in a softer way to begin with. Just tell them you've been having a tough time and had to take some ""mental days"". Talk with a counselor for sure. Antidepressants if you could be helped by them. It's not weakness. Change your diet. Too many sugars and carbs zap your brain and energy (but don't do keto or extreme diets without talking to your doctor first. Go to depression/suicide help groups. It's good to talk about things and a great way to connect in the community. Find a social hobby and go out to groups (board or card games, sports, improv, etc.)",1

depression,dkx9yc,f4lp52w,"Read more. Seriously. The cause of your depression is unique but people have shared the same feeling that you're feeling for centuries, and have been writing about it. Settling your mind a bit could have the effect of increasing energy, calming your outlook.

I wish I knew more about what exactly you're struggling with, or what kick started this off, but filling your mind with words from great thinkers like Aristotle, Schopenhauer, and Sartre and schools of thought like Stoicism and Existentialism should have the affect of easing your mind - showing how ""normal"" this feeling is.

It doesn't even have to be old Philosophers you read about, but finding a book, even if it's a dreaded self-helpy kind of book, could really settle your mind and make sense of some things.

At this point, a lot of what you're feeling now is largely habitual - if you're brain is chemically imbalanced it's because it's been in a ""down"" state for 4 years, not because you were born this way or because you have some kind of disease, but because of your context and situation. You *can* break the cycle, despite everything in you not having the motivation to do so. 

Here's a quote from Arthur Schopenhaeur that I think illustrates the conundrum we as a species find ourselves in:

""The most general survey shows us that the two foes of human happiness are pain and boredom. We may go further, and say that in the degree in which we are fortunate enough to get away from the one, we approach the other. Life presents, in fact, a more or less violent oscillation between the two.""

It's a rather bleak take on life but I think he's hit on something. Living is weird. We don't know exactly why we're here and what we're supposed to do. We're obviously designed in a way to continue our species but with no clear goal beyond that. We have a system in our heads that we are somewhat a slave to, despite feeling like we can make choices and decide things. Really the only thing we can be sure of is that some things manifest themselves as a ""good"" and others as a ""bad"", but beyond that is unclear. At this point, for the privileged Western world at least, we're just finding things to do in between meals. Those things don't have to feel so bad.

depression,dkx9yc,f4lqqo9,"I'm hugging you so hard right now. I live with depression also. I resonate with you deeply on this issue. My coping methods are as follows:

When the dark moments sneak up on me and consume me, I reach out. Its taken time but online groups, a couple of legit friends who understand=these help me a lot. I'm going back to therapy soon.

I've been given all manner of substances for my depression. I use cannabis based CBD/THC ratios for sleeplessness, anxiety, restlessness. Vitamin D supplements are a wonder also. Definitely get some lab work do e for vitamin deficiency.

My next point: my type of auto immune issue plays a huge role. I monitor my health issues, have had to learn waaay better self care, and am careful with my food/social/mental consumptions. Getting checked for hidden health issues made a massive change for me. Along with diet and yoga.

depression,dkx9yc,f4luw2z,"Hey, just as a prior note: I’m not going to say that I’m sorry that you tried to do it (not that I don’t value you as a human or that I want you to die). It’s in the past, and because it was your decision, it’s for you to decide whether or not you’re sorry, for your decision, which you’ve already expressed. 

It really is, even in my, non-religious eyes, a miracle that you’re still alive and especially in such an undamaged condition. I’m happy that that’s the case! 

I also had depression and tried to drown myself a few years back, and I know exactly what the feeling of wanting to escape the pain is. I know the feeling of having no energy, no motivation, comparing your life to those of others, feeling horrible all of the time and feeling as though everyone and everything is against you. 

The fact that you’ve survived such an attempt, and your recognition of that, is clearly a sign that you’re worth something, and that you have some purpose. I should let you know, life may not get any easier, but you’re so much stronger now than you were. You can get through it, and I’m encouraged to hear that you’re taking continued steps to make sure that you don’t try to end your life again. 

In terms of alleviating depression and the answering of your questions, having the sheer willpower to do the things that you’re most scared or demotivated to do, is the only way to improve your life. Try to go for a run, watch a movie, meet up with someone from school or work, eat some cake, get a pet or do something productive, distractive and/or enjoyable.

First off. Driving your car into a median is fucked up. Im hoping this was a major eye opener and a full on realization that none of this shit is normal. THIS IS GOOD. don't normalize this behavior. I find the best medicine to all this is hyper self awareness. The more you are acutely aware of your suicidal thoughts, the more secure your ground is on working through this.



>How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?     


  Cope.  I found coping methods like heavy caffeine and nicotine with a mix of music is my therapy. Its not a cure, but damn it helps.


>-How can I keep up or have more energy?
    
Some funny shit... My best cure was when I tried Meth. ya ya I know, but meth did something to me... I wasn't depressed. I felt for the first time, normal. Like a normal functioning person. I hated the fact that Meth made me not depressed and motivated, hell Ive been Ive been nicer and more cheery. That's super messed up that I was a better person on meth than off. Now coming off meth was suffering. I had to get off meth because it was dehydrating me and made me sick after a few days. However Meth is just a cousin drug to adderal or conserta. I'd ask about conserta. See how that might react with you.  My bout with meth made me hyper aware about my state of mind and why i was getting depressed. As well as help discover my cope.

>-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)


It will keep you busy. But you'll be depressed going through nursing school as you are depressed now. Depression shouldn't stop you from doing something, it's just baggage you bring with you though 

>-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

Find a hobby. Something you can waste time on and really care about doing. Draw, paint, hell Ive taken up Mountain Biking.  I love mountain biking. spent a lot of money on myself for that bike. Best gift to myself I've ever purchased.

>-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?


Find your cope. My cope is caffeine with earbuds hitting an offroad trail. You'll want to find yours. Try everything until you hit an item that takes your mind off of reality. When I bike ride, I'm by myself. in the woods. just 100% lost to my own world. I don't want to die in that place. I want to keep peddling and see how far this deer trail takes me. I get so lost biking, but I don't have a desire to stop and end it.

>-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?


You don't. Unless you are socially extroverted, depression is such a personal issue that even fellow depression users have a hard time empathizing. You can make friends around a hobby or interest. Your motivation would be more focused on them and making them happy as well as give yourself a purpose to be around for your group. I have a small group. Just seeing them keeps me obligated to stay on this earth. I can't die. I have too much shit to do and obligations to meet.

>-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

You were out... or you had a car accident. Or just dodge the question with going through things. You don't have to say anything at all. Because I don't think many of them will understand. Plus nothing worse than all that empathetic caring that your mind won't be able to comprehend or be receptive to.

You deserve to have a healthy body and mind. It is so hard but so incredibly worth it.

All the advice about finding the right medication, exercise, meditation, and focusing on what makes you feel good is excellent advice.  In my experience, nothing is perfect, and accepting things for the way they are in each moment is important.  I have also found that keeping myself focused on positive activities that help me to feel productive and content really helps, even doing mundane things like chores.  Having a clean house or a good meal you made yourself gives a good sense of accomplishment.  Spending quality time with loved ones, exploring your feelings through art, reading meaningful books that make you ponder, getting lots of healthy physical touch from others, all of these things reinforce a sense of value and affirmation for me.  Lastly, being grateful for little things.  It's autumn here, and I love to look at the beautiful colors and feel the crisp humid wind.  I love being cozy under a heavy quilt.  I love thinking about the gifts I want to give to my loved ones for the holidays.  I try to find gratitude in these little things, focusing my thoughts on the sensory aspects that I feel like soft touch, good smells, beautiful colors I see, warmth, cool, the sound of wind, etc.  When I focus on my pleasure at these sensory experiences, my mind is drawn away from ruminating about my sense of failure or my fears or regrets about things in my life.  Instead, I focus on why I am loving my life right now, in this very moment, the beauty and the pleasure of the now.

depression,dkx9yc,f4n1yrj,"Glad you survived OP...keep hanging in there. Depression and anxiety are tough, and it’s a lifelong battle unfortunately, for many of us. It’s an extra burden some of us have to carry, and it doesn’t help that people who have never been through it don’t understand how challenging it can be to even do normal, daily activities that everyone else does with ease. That said...my advice would be to get a bit of sunlight and exercise every day. I realize that when motivation is a struggle that will not come easy, you won’t feel like doing it. Do it anyway. Sometimes the action has to precede the motivation. 

Work with your doctor to find solutions. If a medication isn’t helping, don’t be afraid to ask for something different. I have ADD, depression and anxiety, and have found that it’s necessary to treat all of them, and have had the best response to Viibryd, Vyvanse and PRN Xanax used very conservatively for anxiety attacks. Two of three of those medications are newer and expensive though, so it’s always a battle with insurance to get things approved, but if you’ve tried enough of the less expensive options they will usually allow it. There’s also a new drug called Trintellix that might be worth a shot for you, it works on like...all of the receptors. Very new, very costly, but might help you if nothing else has. If you’re having mixed episodes or any chance of bipolar though you may benefit more from a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. Go low and slow with those though, and stay at the lowest effective dose (even if it’s considered a tapering or child dose), as those meds come with more side effects usually, and the therapeutic doses for adults are too much for some people. Just be very open with your doctor about how you’re feeling so they can help you.

I also have a friend who made a wonderful turnaround after getting TMS. If it’s available in your area that might be worth a try, it’s a bit time consuming while you’re doing it but it worked wonders for her. They basically hit your brain with an MRI magnetic field. Ask your doctor if they think that may benefit you.

Also be aware that your concussion may exacerbate your symptoms for a while. Get plenty of sleep, and practice good self-care for a while, make sure you’re getting nutritious foods and staying hydrated. Might be worth a try to take a good multivitamin, sublingual methyl-B12, vitamin D, and some krill oil. Vitamin deficiencies also make depression and anxiety symptoms worse. 

Good luck OP!",1

I tried to get it back under control, and almost had it, when my back left tire got caught on the lip lf the road. The reported number was that the car flipped three times, hitting the ground thrice before flipping once more. It came to a rest on the passenger side, so I was suspended midair. I was dazed to say the least. It took a second, but I managed to hoist myself up using the steering wheel enough to unfasten my seatbelt. I fell to the driver door, but all the doors were either smashed or blocked. So I looked around for an escape and saw the rear windshield had been taken out by one of the impacts. After I made my escape I called 911 and was taken to the hospital. The only injuries I had was a slight concussion from hitting my head against the driver side window. 

Tl;Dr, I walked away from an incredible crash with a scrape. I had resolved myself to thinking that if I had died that night, I'd be okay with it.

In the end, I'm glad I didn't. I've been struggling every day for the last 10 months to make something of myself to prove that I didn't survive in vain.

depression,dkx9yc,f4n82xw,"The way I have been fighting my depression is through establishing personal principles which I will be fighting for the more I struggle with life.
Once established allow those principles to be sacred. Try to reflect upon them everyday.

One of my principles is the following:

""Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss. It is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live..."" 

Alexandre Dumas


It is undeniable that suffering and bliss are inseparable. Ofc I am extremely anxious and sometimes just want to die. I used to scream at myself ""WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE. DIE DIE DIE!"", hitting myself. And for all those years it wasn't getting any better until I faced my enraged pitiful miserable self with acceptance. 
It is the key. 
Make yourself clear about the fact that the miserable state you're in kind of has to happen. Don't deny this very moment, because as a consequence you will inherently deny any good. 
Let me repeat this: ""ANY GOOD""

Make yourself clear about this. 
And then your time has come to stand up for this revelation. Put this above anything else. 
Be that GANDALF look into the mirror and tell your inner demon that is your denial of the here and now:

""YOU SHALL NOT PASS"" 
THIS IS MY BRIDGE

I might not have much money. 
I might be broke and broken.
But as long as I am me (my own GANDALF),
Nothing will ever stop me.
You know why not?
Because if so, the next moment I will be up on my feet again having accepted my doubt, self-hate, and grown far beyond my imagination.

What might happen tomorrow?
Say your cat dies a cruel death (which happened to me last week). The pain was unbearable and I didn't even think once about GANDALF during my grievance. But my principles have grown from the seed of acceptance in my soul. Its roots have kept me close. My very own ""anchor"".

Thus, with strongly enforced (self-)acceptance ultimate self heal abilities also come to play.
Like my therapist used to say ""It will get better.""
She was right. 
It goes up and down again and again. 
You wont stay on the verge of insanity for too long. You will eventually grow tired.
There's ying so yang is just round the corner maybe taking some puffs in a coffee shop in Amsterdam.

Once this inherency is established there is another important principle to me.

There is more that Alexandre has written in is famous novel ""The Count Of Monte Christo"". 
The next sentence of the quote says the following:

""the sum of all human wisdom will be contained in these two words: Wait and Hope."" 

Once you have reached your inner agreement your next step is to accept the fact that time (based on your new found belief) can actually heal what has to heal. 

Always keep in mind.

Only what is accepted CAN BE HEALED AND at the same time only what is accepted HEALS. 

The cure is in the disease.

\> > How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

Working out is the best option. I was working out almost every day and when I went and really pushed myself and tired myself out, I would walk out of the gym feeling great. When I went there and sat around and barely did anything, I would still walk away feeling shitty. Last week I went on a vacation and haven't worked out since and yesterday I spent all day laying in bed. My brother came to visit and left and I barely talked to him. Reading this and going over it all in my head, I might need to head back to the gym ASAP. Making going the gym a routine certainly seems to help me.

\> > How can I keep up or have more energy?

This one is tough. Different things work for different people. It might be diet or getting a pet because you love animals or just one or two amazing friends or even just a shit load of coffee. All the adults seem to always be tired... except for my neighbors who seem to run for miles everyday, but there's no way I'm doing that.

\> > I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

Yes yes yes. Doing something you want to do is 100x better than just sitting there and wishing you were doing it. The only thing is are you able to go to school and not have it be a hindrance (mostly economically because it costs a lot, also time wise because school can be time consuming and science degrees are a bit more work). If you really want to o it though, it's 100% worth it.

\> > What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

Working out is one habit I mentioned before but theres more. I took a positive psychology class in college and the things I learned from it helped, but I always felt stupid doing it but they did work. The two main practices I took away were a gratitude journal and strength awareness. The gratitude journal is most effective when you do it daily. Try to write in a journal/diary/whatever at the end of the day and write one thing you liked about today. It could be anything from a nice bite of a burger, made a new friend, the weather was nice, watched a nice episode of TV, or less traffic. Literally anything that made you feel better. The second practice is strength awareness. You know how you beat yourself up over the littlest things? Like saying you too back to a waiter after they say enjoy your food? Why. It sucks but all of us do this. Now try to be aware of when you do something right. When you build IKEA furniture properly, tell yourself good job. When you communicate what you wanted to say well, tell yourself good job. Just make it the opposite of that little naggy voice in your head thats so fucking annoying. Both these practices are pretty similar but that's because propping yourself up when you're depressed is hard as shit.

\> > Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

Bruh, I wish. I just like animals so a lot of my reddit feed is filled with them but that's about all I got. Also definitely find a hobby. Mine is super simple with it being video games but I might need to change that up because I lcok myself up in a basement and talk to random kids online.

\> > How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

Bruh here too. Making friends as an adult is tough. The easiest way I found is hobbies like I mentioned above, but other than that, I'm stumped.

\> > What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

I'm not the greatest at lying but you could always say you got really sick and were driving to get some medicine because you thought you were fine and then you got tired and lost control and then totalled it. They're gonna ask about your car too when they don't see it so try to incorporate that into the lie. You don't have to give them all the details and once you tell them you went to the hospital, they won't really care about the rest of the story and will just wonder if you're okay.

Hope this helped and good luck friend.

I got to work, and couldn't face anyone because I would tear up thinking about my life every second or so. I decided to go back home. I got in my car, and called the National Suicide Hotline. The lady who picked up was barely talking to me, and was saying rehearsed stuff like ""I appreciate you calling."" I knew this, but still decided to talk to her. Few minutes into the phone call I started bawling like a kid, and talked about what was making me feel like dying. I talked untill I reached home, and kept talking to her in the parking lot. She wasn't contributing much, but damn it felt so much relief to cry, and get that shit off of my chest. The phone call was 45 minutes long. My life didn't turn around by that phone call, but I got to cry and tell someone about my problems which I would never have done with my friends.

depression,dkx9yc,f4p20gb,"First of all I want to give you a hug. Sounds like you were and still are in so much pain and I sympathize.

When I was in the depth of my depression and would sit for hours on my couch paralyzed and doing nothing, I would occasionally manage to get things done by designating a reward. Like I love cake. Even when I'm really sad and lost interest in other things I still enjoyed cake. Food is an easy source of comfort. I'd tell myself if I get out of the house and go grocery shopping, or if I get this school thing done, I can go buy a slice of cake. Even if I cried while eating said cake it was kind of nice.

I think school might be nice, it's a good way to meet people and build a new social circle. It's also a way to give your life more structure and clearer gosls. However, it might also be stressful and make things worse. Is there a way to do part time? If your financial situation and school allows you to, maybe start out part time and we show you feel? One upside to going back to school is that many universities provide mental health counseling, so you might gain more access to help.

I think you could be honest with your friends about what happened. No use to sugar coat it. Chances are they will be mortified, but those that care for you will then become more aware. When I was suicidal I finally broke down one day and told my boyfriend and my closest friend. She started texting me every other day or so asking me how I'm feeling. It's nice to know that someone cares even when things are really shitty. Medication and therapy helped me but a bit part of what made things feel better was knowing people love me and would still want to be around me when I was at my lowest when I assumed I was horrible to be around. It doesn't necessarily make the pain go away but it does help stabilize things.

I trained myself to tell myself that the negative things told to me by my brain are lies. ""I want to die"" ""no, that's your depression brain speaking, I want to live, I have things I want to do"", ""you suck and nobody finds you funny"" ""no, I have friends, that's proof that I don't suck"". Things like that.

If you could, getting a pet could be very helpful. I didn't get my own pet but I moved in with a roommate that has a dog. The dog has helped me so much. On days I was too unmotivated to do anything I'd force myself to walk her because she loves it. And after I come back from the walk things will feel better.

You’re a strong person and I encourage you to keep going. 
It’s taken me a long time to begin my journey in recovery and I’m still working on it, it truly takes commitment, patience and motivation within yourself. 
What’s helped me could help you, or it won’t, but I’ll suggest what has.
1. If you’re open to the idea, shrooms. Magic mushrooms can provide a more positive, open minded perspective on life. You might find yourself, find the beauty in things, feel lighter. But it also has its risks and I recommend doing research on it before trying anything. 
2. Accepting and adapting. I’ve observed, learned and thought a lot about life, questioned my own purpose and if there really is a point in any of this - while there may be no point, it’s really up to you to make what you want of it. It’s yours after all. You kind of have to adapt to the way society is set up, accept that some people and some things are always going to be the way they are and decide how you want to react and live to it. Only you can make the best of what you have. 
3. Find yourself. Explore hobbies, maybe you have a secret talent you have no idea about! I read somewhere that said something along the lines of finding 3 main hobbies - one that keeps you healthy (for ex: cooking or going to the gym), one that keeps you happy (travelling, gaming, art, etc) and one that makes you money (a job/career) I felt that was pretty good advice. 
4. Prioritize yourself, people understand that shit happens and you can be not okay. You can let your friends know that you’re going through a difficult time and would appreciate any understanding and patience, and that they’re not forgotten. Your mental health is important. You are not obligated to spend your energy or time with anyone and if they’re not understanding of your situation they can f*ck off. Life is too short to take on unnecessary stress and pressure from those who do not really contribute to your happiness/peace. Those who show understanding are worth keeping in your life. 
5. Use your time doing things you won’t regret. Try new foods, treat yourself, go away for a bit, attend workshops, be a tourist in your own city, give yourself a spa day. Be daring. You can’t die yet, there’s so much to fall in love with in this life.

So eventually I just had to stop listening to myself and letting myself think in those patterns. If I managed to have a good time, I relished it for what it was, and tried to avoid comparing it to how I used to be happy, or how I should be doing. Remind yourself constantly that anything you do can be a step in a right direction. When you finally shower and go outside for the first time in days, be proud that you did, and don’t think about how you should have already.

Do whatever you feel like you can. Don’t judge yourself for not being able to do things you can’t. Try to find a single thing that you can find even the smallest enjoyment in, and do that.

Okay, I'm 44 now, but I have suffered with depression so terribly in the past, and why I say my age is because at least it is becoming more recognised now. I would still suffer if it wasn't for the medication I am on.

It annoys me that we almost seem to be medieval when it comes to diseases of the brain, if the issue made depressed people's heads turn green then I'm sure something would be done about it.

Right, the first thing I'm going to tell you, as someone who's been to the depths of hell with this and back is - don't kill yourself. There is, but you're going to have to push for it, the right medication out there.

I will try to be your support network friend. I think a lot of depression as well comes from trying to make other people happy. I used to love art but was told by my parents I wouldn't get a job doing that, so I stopped and that made me very unhappy, Basically, I tried to do stuff to make everyone else happy, and also having a pre-disposition to depression made that even worse. 

But the main thing is with depression is this - your brain probably does not produce the amount of serotonin that it should do, and you need to take a drug to help it to, just as a diabetic takes insulin. EST is really quite risky, I'd get the medication route sorted out first, and then think about what would make you happy? 

Lots of love and we're all rooting for you x",1

depression,dkx9yc,f8mufbc,"I'm super new to Reddit and just found this sub so sorry this is an old post, but your story really resonated with me. This is also a temp. account because I wanted to be anonymous from friends that might know my regular one.

Anyways, 5 years ago I attempted suicide after a 4-5 year struggle with mental health. After a lot of shit that happened I decided it was too hard to go on, really I just wanted all the bad thoughts and pain to end. I stayed home from school one day and took a whole bottle (40-50 pills) of pain killers. Not just over the counter ones, hard ones that need a prescription. To top it off I took like 20 pills of melatonin, idk if this does anything but I wanted it to be quicker. I scribbled a little note for my family to find, turned on my favourite song, and closed my eyes. Surprisingly, 3 hours later I woke up, nobody even noticed. Somehow though my mom knew something was up and I confessed. She took me to the hospital, by body was twitching and I was having some fucked up symptoms from all the drugs in my body, I waited in emerg for like 5 hours before they even admitted me despite all of this. Once I saw the doctor and told them what I had taken they were shocked to find nothing was severely damaged. It was awhile ago and I was pretty hazy from the drugs, but I'm pretty sure they gave me fluids, observed me for another hour or so, asked if I was planning on doing it again, and discharged me. The nurses and doctors were shocked that after all I had taken they didn't find anything really wrong with me physically.

Same with how you felt, I figured it was a miracle and there must be some reason that it all didn't work. The first month after that was really hard. I didn't know how to act around the people that knew, I didn't know how to cope with it myself, but I knew that I had to get better. I dropped out of school for the semester, quit my job, moved in with my grandparents for a change of scenery and started seeing a therapist. It worked for a bit, but therapy has always been hard for me because I struggle with opening up and being vulnerable about my struggles (ironic because I'm putting it out there for anyone to see now). Eventually I went off my anti-depressants. I definitely don't recommend this as a way for dealing with mental health struggles, a lot of people definitely do need medication and that's absolutely okay, but it was something that worked for me. It has definitely still been one of the hardest things for me to live with, my issues are always there for me and I still struggle with suicidal ideation. But one of the biggest things that have helped is just accepting myself and all the shit that I've gone through as something that I can't change now and instead can be something to learn from. As for opening up to friends, never feel like you're obligated to tell them just because they are your friends. You can make up a lie or just say ""shit happened I don't want to talk about it"" and if they're your friends they'll accept that. I realize it's been a month since you posted this so I truly hope you've been feeling a bit better and have found some things that have helped, but what I tend to rely on is looking at small accomplishments that I've done to keep motivated. Maybe all I did was shower or make my bed or respond to text messages that I left unopened, but that's a start and something to be proud of. Motivation is hard, especially when you have no energy, but finding positives in your life and things that you know will make you happy and keeping those things close will help. Hanging out with friends, playing video games, having a nice meal, whatever makes you feel good in a moment is something to treasure, even if you feel like shit once the moment is over at least you have some nice things to focus on when the bad thoughts come back. It's cliche but exercise definitely helps with energy. It's hard when you're busy or if money is an issue, but taking the time even once a week to get your heart pumping is really helpful even if it's just a walk around the block. Also pets are super great for helping you feel grounded because they really love you unconditionally and that's something to remember. Overall, do things that you want to do and don't try to hold yourself back because of what other people might think or say. You have to be able to identify and cope with the underlying things that are causing you to feel like this and that will be a tough process, but if it ever feels like it's too hard, just look back and see how far you've come.

It's really admirable to see your motivation and drive to get better, and even if it might feel overwhelming and super fucking hard some days, you're insanely brave and strong to look back on this and take it as a lesson and reason to get better. Sending love and solidarity. Keep fighting.

depression,dkx9yc,f4l8usz,"Seconded on many of the things here... I think it's amazing that you've gotten this ""second chance"" in some sense, and it sounds like you're really trying hard to get into a better head-space, so kudos to you for that.

Personally I wouldn't worry too much about accounting for your absence to others - you have control over your own narrative, and you can tell people as much or as little as you want. That said, it might help if you opened up about the near-death experience to some trusted people, just so they're aware of how close you came and can offer you support in future. I think telling the story may also give you hope in some way? 

As for nursing, yes it's a tough path but if you feel that you're going nowhere in your job and would rather be challenged than just drift through your days, then why not give it a try? Try finding a course that offers some flexibility, so you can press pause if you get overwhelmed.

Motivation is hard, I still have days that just getting out of bed feels like the toughest thing but I really just try to push myself past that for the most part. Make plans that you have to keep or it would be hard or inconvenient to get out of for extra motivations if that might help. 

I went off my antidepressants about 6 months after my attempt. I felt like I was in a better place in terms of things I had in my life. I started doing things for myself, being healthier, holding the friends that cared about me close, and at that point was still seeing my therapist. That being said it was still a really careful process. While I was on medication I felt like nothing really was changing within my head, I was just more numb to it all. My doses also kept having to be increased because they just weren't really doing anything. I don't know if maybe a different medication would have helped instead or if some other type of therapy on top of that medication would have done anything, but I eventually just decided to go off. Personally, I think that medication isn't a bad thing, some people need it and that has nothing to do with them, just how their body works. But in my experience I didn't find the medication to be helping and I committed myself to the lifestyle changes that were helping me feel better. I also didn't stop cold turkey, I just started decreasing my dosage more and more until eventually I was off them for good. This was something that I discussed with my doctor and therapist, not something that I just did on my own which is also important. 

If you do decide to go off, make sure it's something that your doctor and therapists can get behind, and having a social support network will really help with the change too in terms of keeping you in check with how your body and mind is actually reacting to the change.",1

Maybe life is not all we thought it would be. I find it incredibly hard. But this it. This is all there is. You are here for 90 years, then you are gone forever. Even writing that makes me depressed.... But it should also do something else, focus your mind. No matter how shit this is, this is our shit and it is the only shit you will get. 

If things are getting on top of you.... Slow down. Make a nest. Inhabit it. Avoid alcohol. Go on Reddit. Watch a TV show you love. WhatsApp people. Stay in bed and stay safe. Buy a fucking car with a limited top speed (apologies for a weak attempt at flippancy).

And only one (that is how lucky you are) survives. And the team ask him.... ""What was going through your mind after you jumped?"".

He says words to this effect.... I suddenly realised that every problem in my life was solvable, except for the fact I had just jumped off that bridge. 

The fall takes about 10 seconds. 10 seconds that most people think... I want to live, but I cannot take this back.

In your darkest night... The sun will come. All things must pass. Sadness to happiness. Happiness back to sadness. Light to dark. Dark to light. If you cannot accept that then things will be harder than they need to be. You have to make things as easy as you can. Slow down. Dig in and stay safe by going easy on yourself.",0

depression,dkx9yc,f4mpf1p,"The amount of time I spend playing mindless video games is too much to count, so don't feel bad. I have to force myself to balance it out and moderate because I know it's for the better, but I struggled with it for a long time - like years. And it turns out that in the end, moderation actually makes the gaming better than it would've been if I would've played more. 30 minutes of reading, and a 30 minute run, and then an hour of gaming actually feels better than if I would've gamed for 2 hours. It feels inauthentic for a while, having to forcefully structure your time this way, but it'll eventually become second nature and feel right.

As far as reading goes, start out by reading [this speech](http://www.metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf) from author David Foster Wallace. The text originates from a commencement speech given by Wallace at Kenyon College in 2005. It's just thoughtful and real, a good place to start and should only take about 10 minutes to read.

I'm gonna get back to you when I find a book that I think you should read, I don't want to just throw out a recommendation without giving it more thought.",1
depression,dkx9yc,f4q9zyd,"So I'm having trouble finding just one book to recommend so instead I'll recommend to use reading, podcasting, movie watching like I do and that's to use them as a way to fill your mind with things bigger than you and your situation.

I gravitate to reading philosophy a lot of the time because it usually deals with ideas that are much bigger than me as an individual, even if it can relate to me on an individual at some level. Questions like what does it mean to be a human, how should one live, what is the Good with a capital G, how should one act, what is meaning and purpose, what is god or God, what is consciousness -- it's liberating and a breath of fresh air to have my mind filled with these big ideas as opposed to whatever is directly happening to me. 

It's not full on escapism, I don't neglect my situation, like my health or job or wife and kid, but it's a temporary escape to a different level of thought and that deals with topics much larger than any one person.

With that said, books like ""Philosophy Bites"" (they also have a podcast which is fantastic, I really enjoy the avenue a podcast offers) and ""Answers for Aristotle"" would be good starting points if Philosophy is an unfamiliar topic.

Good luck to you. It's easy for me to say given the position I'm in but I truly do believe that the good things in life feel much better than how bad the bad things feel  -- I hope you can get your head to a calmer place so you can enjoy those things.",1

Yeah, Venlafaxine (Effexor) somehow litterally broke my heart every late or missed dose and felt like I was dying when I came off it. Made me too dizzy to stay awake twice.

I was absolutely terrified of killing myself or just dying. But, I'm not the kind of person that expresses my anger through violence. I'm neary 100% certain that suicide is caused by expressing anger through violence. Consuming alchohol while angery could leave us without faculties for ling term thinking.

Regardless of what triggers the anger. Be it shame, guilt, despair, dissapointment. Life will last at least a long time if we don't see ourselves as the type of person who seeks to end it. The thought that I've felt worse before, and better before and I can feel different someday got me through that.

We are human. That means we can't know everything. We don't even know who loves us, or who is capable of demonstrating love to us in ways we can understand. I can hardly tell what love looks like in my 30's. I do know people love me with different degrees of ability to express it. 

I believe that is why forgiveness is so powerful. When you are able to forgive you don't need others or yoursef to be perfect. You can judge them and you as people doing their best with what they have. It's almost damaging to do otherwise.

Romance has complications that friendships don't. There are all kinds of games. When looking for a relationship, it's not just about ""I like this person"", there's also ""what can they bring into my life?"" That's why depression drives potential mates away.

I know they'd support me if I chose to slow down again and take more time for myself, but they've been overly critical about the whole thing in the context of others, that it's soured the thought of trying it myself. 

It shouldn't feel like it to seek help, and it didn't the first time when I did it, but this time it'd feel like a personal failure, a self-admitted defeat in a way. It just feels like after all this time living this way, I should be better at this. I should have figured this out by now.

depression,izn5op,g6lbfsh,"Hey friend. That's shitty, how you were treated.

I want to tell you however, my personal story, briefly.

I smoked weed for about 10 years. Ever since I was a young teenager. I enjoyed it quite a bit, the taste, the smell, the feeling of being high. 

I finally made the realisation that weed was not helping me grow as a person. I was lazy, even in my most passionate hobbies. Easily distracted. Uncommitted to things. I think it stems from the memory effects, and has a energy draining quality for me. 

It wasn't ruining my life by any means. But I am feeling more confident socially and personally now having not used it for a few months. I was tired of the mood swings. I was tired of not feeling right unless I got high.

I wasn't even using *that* much. A bong pack or two a day. 

I admit that the legal status and social stigma of being high added to the stress, for me. I also note that not everyone has the same effects from using it. I think it can have benefits sometimes. I don't regret using it.

I do think it was not helping my mental health, though. I am glad I have not used it for a few months. I have more energy and patience. 

I still have bad days occasionally, but I think my mental health is better.

You might want to try taking a break from it. It might help. Depending on how much you use it, you may go through up to a couple weeks of unpleasant thoughts as your mind and body recalibrate. You may find yourself wanting to smoke it months or years later. Maybe you will prefer to merely cut back on your use. 

I don't think weed is evil, it's different for everyone, but I think it can complicate mental health issues in some people, such as myself .

I have wondered if I myself were partly autistic also. Or bipolar, or borderline personality disorder. Or antisocial, or a host of other things. I don't really worry about that now. There are many other things you can do to improve your mental health. Try some of them. Meditation, affirmations, reading, there are more

And if you decide to subside or temper your marijuana use, there are two subreddits : r/leaves for quitting and r/petioles for moderating your use 

Take care and good luck

Edit, I wanted to add I've had bouts of depression and bad luck with therapists also.",1

I was then refered to go to see a psychiatrist by my doctor and after a quick internet review search on the guy, i found out at least 3 of his patients have ended up in a catatonic state/more suicidal than they were before, and that he's activitely told patients they dont need medication if they accept the bible

It was honestly mortifying to read, so I went back to my doctor and told her 'absolutely not' so now im waiting 2 months to see someone else.  


The system sucks yes, but id rather wait/go undiagnosed than have to see someone like that. Sorry you had to experience it, I can imagine it wouldve made me feel more crazy than I already do",3
depression,izn5op,g6mnw3r,"I dont understand how doctors dont get reprimanded for misdiagnosis' like that more often. Im not a doctor by any means, but I feel like an inflamed gallbladder would be a ""simple enough"" kinda diagnosis with many telltale signs. Again Im not a doctor and know mostly only basic functions of the body.

However I am a semi truck mechanic, and if a trucker comes in and says ""My truck pops and pulls super hard to the right when I hit the brakes"" I cant just say ""well dont hit the brakes and that wont happen"". I have to go through the diagnosis and tests of ""are the brake chambers working smoothly? Are the shoes worn or are they pulling off the plate? Are the drums cracked?"" And so on. I know it isnt a direct comparison and the human body is infinitely more complex than a truck, but if I sent that trucker back out with faulty brakes, he could hurt himself or others.

That first doctor sent you out with a faulty gallbladder that couldve burst causing numerous other illnesses and conditions and I dont understand it.",12
depression,izn5op,g6jvckt,It was my fear too and this doctor really fucked it all up.,50
depression,izn5op,g6l74mi,That's why it's important to get a second opinion. There's a way to tell someone their feelings are valid but it may not be a mental illness without just totally passing it off. If you feel like someone is dismissing you they might be. You may not know the answers but you know you.,3
depression,izn5op,g6mktdv,so i'm not alone in not seeing a therapist?,1
depression,izn5op,g6n4vna,"Please don't let the story from OP hold you back from getting help. I just had my first therapy session a few days ago and my therapist is a kind, calm and understanding person. She listened patiently to all the problems I told her and if she recognized that I'm stuck she asked all the right questions to keep me going again. 

She explained to me that the first three sessions are for making a diagnosis so she mainly just listens, writes things down and asks follow-up-questions. After that, the ""normal"" therapy is starting where she's trying to help me.  But she already gave me some good advice in the first session. 

I couldn't be happier about how this went and I'm so glad I made this step of making an appointment.",1
depression,izn5op,g6ldc3w,Ikr. I don’t know shit about psychology but like... maybe the drugs use is due to mental illness...,8
depression,izn5op,g6r4ojc,"Yo as fucking hard as it is please don't give up. There are good therapists/psychiatrists out there. Having a bad experience with one can honestly be traumatic as there is a lot of hope and trust being put on the line in that interaction. Seeing it betrayed or at least not being met with a thoughtful and intelligent response hurts, it hurts a lot. But that doesn't invalidate the real good a therapist who shares your perspective can do in helping meet your goals/live a fulfilling life. It took me almost 5 years of discouragement bouncing around the system before I found someone who I felt really got me. But now that I have I feel like I'm making actual progress for the first time in a really long while. Please don't give up seeking help forever friend, it is out there.",1
depression,izn5op,g6k1tvx,"I’m in Canada so it’s kinda funny 

It’s probably a good idea to not tell them about the cannabis, you’re right. I called my doctor and I’ve got an appointment set up, so I’m going to get another referral I hope",29
depression,izn5op,g6m5kr7,"I mean his reasoning for why cannabis use isnt very good was pretty fair, and it applied to me and I should quit anyways. But that’s not the issue I went for. I’ve been dealing with so many problems since my childhood and he just completely failed to acknowledge anything I tried to say. Anyways enough about that guy, I’m high. 

I am seeing a psychologist, I’ve seen him for 10 sessions and he’s a really cool guy and I see him 2-3 a month. Things just aren’t really working with him because I’m still just getting high all day and I can’t really make a change. I was expecting to get some medication or something and a diagnosis from the psychiatrist cuz that’s what he’s supposed to do. I’ll just ask my psychologist for a recommendation for my family doctor because she doesn’t want to give me anything without a diagnosis, that’s why I went to see the guy today. 

I dunno hopefully shit works out, I’m trying

Some of the shit he said did make sense tbf, cannabis does cause a lot of problems and I recognize them in myself.

I was really hoping he would prescribe me at least a basic medication, just to try, but I’ll ask my family doctor I guess.

I've had TOO MANY doctors misdiagnose/almost kill me.  A lot of standard medicine doctors trip shit bc patients use cannabis. If there's any way to see a licensed cannabis doctor in your state, I advise you start there. My doctor helped with my diagnoses and wellness.",51

My parents, who had 5 other children to take care of, had to use money that we didn’t have to get a copy of it to bring to that dinosaur of a doctor, and he didn’t even look at it. 

This misdiagnoses happened to me, it happened to OP, and it is happening too much. None of the rest of us would be able to keep our jobs if we failed so badly at them, but doctors do.

depression,izn5op,g6lwtss,"Yup he probably did mean that, just irritated me because I told him I've been depressed since I was a teen and am only seeking treatment now at 32. Wasn't looking for medication necessarily, just something more I guess.

He didn't outright call me lazy, but his tone after I mention being depressed turned super condescending for the rest of the appointment. I couldn't wait to get out of there, although a screwy part of me was weirdly relieved after having my feelings that others would look down on me for being a nobody validated.",1
depression,izn5op,g6l6bpj,"Marijuana is a drug and using it may lead to addiction. Obviously it's not the same category as cocaine or meth. It's much softer, similar to alcohol or nicotine. I have two friends who got addicted to weed. One of them was a brutal case - first he was depressed, then he he became suicidal and finally : he called for the ambulance and went to the psychiatric hospital. They mended him up. Both of my friends eventually decided to quit smoking and they're seeing a therapist now.

Sometimes, it's not just the weed that causes the issue. Sometimes, it's a deeper personal problem that you're trying to escape from and you've chosen  weed as the tool. It never works in the long run. Smoking weed is awesome but it just gives you relief. The problems will start creeping in sooner or later. Deal with them first and then go back to smoking.",7
depression,izn5op,g6lsg1s,My therapist actually supports marijuana for mental health problems. It can really help my anxiety and for a while I was afraid to tell her I smoked it as my primary care and my dentist both are very anti-pot and pretty much lectured me but my therapist was really cool about it. I never have had much luck with a psychiatrist but I can tell you that therapy and or counseling may be more personable and accommodating. I’ve had the same therapist nearly 8 years and just a revolving door of med students prescribing my meds without really caring.,16
depression,izn5op,g6mrzgc,"Im really sorry to hear that happened to you, but Im glad that youre here to tell the tale. Hindsight is always 20/20, yeah you couldve reported that doctor but reporting malpractice isnt exactly top of the list during that situation. By the time things have settled and life is back to normal, you ask if its even worth your time to report it. Stay strong, and anyone who comes across a doctor who wont listen or forces personal beliefs, write a review for that shit. Many doctors operate on word of mouth and references.",2
depression,izn5op,g6mynuz,"ah yes, CBT or as I like to call it ""Have you considered not thinking the thoughts you're thinking instead of thinking them?""",1
depression,izn5op,g6r1pga,"This, this a thousand times. Just because you had a shitty doctor misdiagnose you doesn't mean you should now be distrustful of all psychiatrists. It just means you need to find a good one who will take the whole picture into account. Any psychiatrist worth their salt should know that self medicating (very often with marijuana/alcohol) are comorbid with a number of mental health issues. If you feel you can't trust a psychiatrist find a different one. Do not lie to them, by omission or otherwise. Their purpose is to help you get to a place you feel happy and healthy, and if that includes marijuana use they should be okay with that so long as it's being used in a healthy fulfilling manner. Whatever that might look like based on your goals.

All that said finding a good psychiatrist you can trust is far easier said than done. Try not to be discouraged as good psychiatrists are out there and with persistence I'm certain you can find one you gel with.",2
depression,izn5op,g6m6rv4,"That’s true, marijuana can lead to addiction. It has very dichotomous effects on people. For some, it helps anxiety, for other (like me) it worsens it. The scientific community is still out on a verdict for depression. The effects exhibited in one particular person are unique to that person. So it’s not fair to generalise it as all bad or all good.  
I think what nyminute917 was trying to say was that it can help people, and you’ve just given an example of how it can worsen people’s suffering; both viable possibilities. However, it’s important to be sure of what you’re talking about. Because what you’re describing about your friends sounds like a trend I’ve noticed about people who criticise the drug but are oblivious about it’s true nature.  

I had depression and anxiety before I started taking marijuana and hid it well. When my issues became public so did my marijuana use. People, including a psychiatrist I saw, instantly jumped to the conclusion that it was marijuana.  People don’t want to acknowledge how it helped me a lot - not necessarily for my anxiety but for my depression. In their minds, it was always the big bad drug that caused all of this, they don’t want to see how I was already escalating before I tried marijuana and how that experimentation helped smooth things out for me. Of course I got sick of the negative effects of the drug and quit it, but then I was left to fend for myself against my depression and anxiety, which continued to worsen for a few more years. I found drinking was the worst for me, not cannabis.  
Cannabis was just a temporary fix for me and I think for everyone else who has ever used it. It never really deals with the real issues, but it can be a major help, not necessarily and always a contributor.  

Edit: And OP is just pointing out how this bias can be found in the mental health professionals whom we pay to diagnose the undercurrent problems instead of jumping to conclusions and blaming drug use.",0
depression,izn5op,g6lx6bd,I also use cannabis for depression and the fun eating disorders my autoimmune has created. Therapy and having an O.D. doctor rather then an M.D. doctor has made a MASSIVE difference in my health care. I was prescribed 1200mg of lithium by a careless psychiatrist. It was unnecessary and interacted with my asthma medication. Sporadically stopping my heart. I was 24yrs old. The reason for my mood disorder? Untreated celiac and a belly full of tumors weighing in at 5lbs. My body thought it was pregnant when it wasn't.  Life is miraculous now with helpful medical professionals.,8
depression,izn5op,g6nb50b,"I just wanna flip it for those reading and say I've been smoking weed for 20 years and it most definitely makes my anxiety worse at times. When this starts happening, I just stop smoking for a few weeks and I can go back to it. I find it can help when depression is bad and it helps a bit with my back pain. 

Whilst I'm a proponent of Cannabis, it doesn't work for everyone. So if you haven't ever smoked and are suffering with anxiety, don't think it's a magic cure, because it's not. Often anxiety can be caused by not dealing with problems in your life, and weed will bring these issues to the forefront of your mind. If you don't know how to deal with these thoughts, be prepared for some panicking.

I'm real glad it helps you out though.",3

depression,izn5op,g6olioo,Good question. I just recall one appointment a year or so ago (I would have been 21-22 and my state legalized it recreationally). They asked me to fill out some forms on my medical history because I guess I haven’t been in a while. There was a question of “Do you smoke/Engage with recreational drugs?”  And being the anxious bastard I am I immediately thought “what if I have to undergo a procedure and pot messes with anesthesia or something oh god I do not wanna die” so I mentioned I smoked pot a bit not daily or anything. I had been seeing the same dentist and hygienist since I was a child and I guess they felt they had the authority to lecture me,2

I think it was just me being worried about going on it but it was bearable and well worth it because once it fully kicked in (takes a few weeks usually), my anxiety was so much better. This was just my experience though.  I was still me but just less anxious. I hope you find something that works for you. A doctor can help you figure that out. Just remember though not all medication is the same and if you give a medication a chance and find it doesn’t work for you or is giving bad side effects then it doesn’t mean you can’t find something better.

If the medication treats symptoms and allows you to be consistent then I’d say it is better then the alternative. Also I thought a lot of antidepressants and well a lot of medication in general can cause weight gain but no all of them some can cause weight loss. Body weight exercises are great you can add some planks, lunges, squats while holding weights, different types of push-ups. Tricep dips, pick up objects and do bicep curls, maybe when you feel up to it try the gym once a week maybe you can walk or jog there. Maybe the gym has a free trial period. Getting outside is good being in the backyard gets you some sunlight also good for depression. For help gaining weight try drinking calories it’s easier you want to make sure you’re getting enough protein so consider a mass gainer protein supplement you can get online or at Walmart for solid calories and protein. I’m my experience exercise is great for depression and could be an Avenue to being healthier physically and mentally but remember it’s not all about getting big that takes time you want to be healthy so also consider adding in some cardio that also helped my anxiety.

depression,dxxwxn,f7xjeli,"Typically your company will go with a carrier. Such as Anthem OR Kaiser.  For instance my company uses a broker that goes with Anthem. All our plans are anthem based.  

However you may be able to call their customer service line (usually it's in a packet for any questions) and ask about Anthem OR ask about their best plans for mental health. 

I am sorry to hear about the relationship tension, that's a really difficult one to tackle.  Here's what I can say from my experience, and I don't know you nor am I a professional so take this with a cup of salt: Sometimes when I get depressed (closing off, isolating, no energy, no motivation, etc) my wife gets stressed out because even if she understands what's happening she doesn't know how to ""fix"" it.  The reality is it's something I have to change nobody can shake me out of a spiral, ultimately my psychiatrist tries to see if med changes can help and my psychologist tries to help me identify triggers and stressors and ways to handle them - because I can't process that far once I hit the rabbit hole.  Just a possibility. If you'd like to chat more feel free but don't feel obligated. I'll probably be up another hour or so.... Took the sleep Med.

EDIT: HEY! ALSO CALL YOUR NEAREST SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE (assuming your in the US) and tell them what's happening and say you'd like some resources because you're getting some limitations from your insurance. Those folks do care about people. Pretty sure they only make like 45k if they wanted to have higher paying jobs they could. My experience thus far is they chose the job to help people in need.  They're not miracle workers but maybe they can help you. And you know what? Call some therapists and ask for a cash discounted rate if you have to.

depression,dxxwxn,f7y2odv,"Thanks 😊 in my exhaustion I fell asleep but it’s really awesome to know there’s some nice people that’ll listen to me when I need it. Idk if this is going to work out but I’m kind of whatever about it. Found out that my boyfriend was basically cheating on me - not physically, but to me emotional cheating is much worse because he was talking to this girl he knows and was telling her he loves her and and how he wants to be with her and telling her all about his problems when he is so closed off to me due to his anxiety and I would not push him to talk about it because it ends up in an argument. And it’s worse to me because I can’t even get any kind of affection like that when I’m actually here, been here, getting him through so much, helping him through school and getting us by financially without asking for anything in return. Like honestly, I feel like he’s just over the relationship, but we’re in this shitty situation now because we live together and I just want him to gtfo but like I haven’t even been able to talk to him because as soon as I called him out he just fucking left all day and didn’t come back until i was going to bed and I just don’t have the energy for that. He refuses to talk to me when he’s upset and I just don’t even know what to do about it. So like, I can’t even have a conversation about breaking up and moving on or trying to repair whatever’s left. Oh well. Looking like a shitty week for me though. But I know I’ll get through it. I always do. Just want closure or something though. Don’t think that’s too much to ask for.",2
depression,dxxwxn,f7y9uhd,"That's a difficult situation to be in, it sounds like you need to have a serious talk with him one way or another.  And maybe try to frame the discussion in such a way to avoid a fight, while being honest about your needs and expectations.  
For example:

* Bad way: ""I know you were talking to X about really personal stuff and that's cheating on me"" (accusation)

* Better way: ""**I'm** feeling shut out and like you don't want to continue the relationship because X, Y, and Z.  Can you help me understand what your side of this is so **we** can decide how to better take care of each others needs, or decide how we'd like our relationship to go from here.""

There's other ways to word it but according to my therapist the key is:

* Respect YOUR needs but phrase it in a way it's a discussion (not a demand but clearly stating what you need)

* Refrain from accusations, arguments don't go anywhere as you've already said.  Focus on making it a discussion, keep things from escalating.  If he's not ready to talk tell him you respect it but you'd like to speak in the next ____ timeframe (days, weeks, etc) that way you're clearly stating your deadline so he can process and choose to come to you when he's comfortable 

* First state your needs and expectations, then give him time to state his. Or vice versa.

For FMLA, HR told me that a psychiatrist needs to certify that they are providing my ongoing care, even if it’s outpatient. Once approved for FMLA, by law my company cannot fire me for being on FMLA. There is a maximum amount of 12 weeks. Some companies may offer full paid leave, and others may offer a percentage of pay.

I hope this helps you. I know it’s hard to discuss with HR, but just remember you don’t have to share details about your condition - just that you would like to inquire about the process.

Then the one guy that lives in Cali came back (I'm in PA) for a week and wanted to hang out.  I ended up not seeing him because I screwed up days and was in a deep dark depression.  All I said was ""sorry we didn't hang out but I'm going through bad depression right now.  Definitely next time (he's wealthy and comes in several times a year to see family)"".  He stopped responding to me and I never heard from him again after texting almost daily for 2 years.",3

Hmmm I would like to point out that you are worth helping. You've said that you have social workers. Even though its is their jobs to help people, they have taken on that job because they see the value is your's and other people's lives. People who are just like you.

To be honest, your story is striking similar to one of my friends. She was raped several times, has a shitty family, and sever mental health problems. She tried to commit suicide multiple times. That was in high school. Now she is currently working on becoming a nurse in a psych ward. She wants to take the pain and suffering I'm her life and use it to understand, relate to and ultimately help people that are going tough times.

If she is able get better so are you. You have so much potential. You've said that you've been able to get straight As in the past. What that says to me is that you've had a passion for learning. The world needs people like you to tell their stories and make the world a better place.

So please dont kill yourself. You have so much growing left to do.

You could try searching ""3blue1brown"" on YouTube. Its is an amazing channel on math concepts. I love it and it made me love math. I'm also a total nerd.

But seriously dont kill yourself. Your social workers see your potential. You can make better friends eventually but you just need to get there first :)",57
depression,eophbs,feen9gz,"That is so hard man. You are so fucking strong and not many people have your strength. No one here can provide good advice on the family issues because they are very tough to deal with and they must be dealt with on a professional level. 


But for your other problems - don't worry too much about your weight. I know it can be annoying and you see yourself as ""fat"" but most of the time you are not. I used to think I was but now that I look back, I was so skinny and I looked stupid. Now I am trying hard to gain weight and I wish I could be fatter. This is 100% honesty I am not making it up. Fat=muscle. It is genuinely not the end of the world. Hitting the gym when you are fatter = lots of muscle. That is why people bulk up all the time.



Please seek all the professional help you can get. They are the professionals and will know what to do. If they offer you drugs, TAKE them. If you are truly in such a dark state, how can these drugs that will probably make you feel better, make you worse?





I recently completed my A-Levels (maths, further, chem, physics) and did very well. I don't mean to sound arrogant but I feel like I know some of the best ways to actually revise. If you ever need any help I will be so happy to help. I know it is not much but I just want to offer some sort of help. Ask anything, anytime and I promise I will respond ASAP. I can also help with any university applications if you are doing that.",100

depression,eophbs,fefxxef,"Dude, I'm not gonna do anything except say be more selfish. Seldom do people actually accomplish anything with the only intention being to ""be a good person"" or ""help people"". These should be consequential in the pursuit of our own happiness. 

I am currently 3 years into my third job, where I managed to ruin my professional career by always coming in late to work, and doing fuck all when I'm there. I am awaiting the inevitable decline of my life when I get fired, I get sued by my employers, and get kicked out by my parents for being a worthless leech. My weight also fluctuates to reflect my mental state, and right now I am overweight/obese (85kg). I've been diagnosed with hypertension since I was 24, and now can't exercise properly because I suspect I have a heart disease and my kidneys are failing. I've also been diagnosed with neuropathy due to high blood sugar/pre-diabetes. But through all this anxiety, I dread going to the doctor more because I don't have insurance, and I don't want to spend the remainder of my life in a dirty hospital room waiting for an unmotivated asshole in a white coat to kill me on the operating table.

While we may have different problems, I've had similar thoughts. Don't cringe when you say ""the good guy gets nothing"". A lot of wrong, idealistic shit is taught to us when we are children about what it means to be a good person. The main fuck-up there is that the propaganda targeted at rich liberal children to be more ""self-sacrificing"" and ""give themselves to others"" gets thrown around among less privileged circles. The monkeys and the sociopaths will be ok, but empaths and kids raised like adults will have the hardest time reconciling why success/happiness comes at the perceived expense of others, or the disruption of the structure that they have known their whole life. This world owes us nothing if we don't decide to take it for ourselves.

You are right in that being good and positive won't help you. What you need to do is to know what you want, and dedicate your whole life in pursuit of that. Happiness comes if it wills.",9

Who would you be if you didn't think these thoughts? Prob better right? Good enough reason to start not believing them. But it takes time. 

I can get into details on some techniques you can start doing. But I want this overall message to be about this....

You haven't even lived a quarter of your entire life. Some people have been depressed for 16 years (your entire life age) and come out of it strong, entrepreneurs, authors, comedians, writers. This is just a period of your life. It is not everything that exists, it just SEEMS that way. Just know that, and it will give you some ease. My entire life changed in just ONE year. I no longer think the same way I did a YEAR ago. Please allow yourself more time....there is a lesson to be learned here. Be patient with life. You have seen all bad happen so far, of course you believe that's all there is. But wait until you get into your adult life, explore other things, and as you grow you will change and have more insight....

depression,eophbs,feg13f8,"First off, goddamn, Im sorry you had such a rough childhood. Secondly, fuck family. That word has lost meaning the older I've gotten. No my family hasn't put me through what they did to you, but in the end they're just people. Family means something to some people, but very little to a lot of people. If they dont care about you then you shouldn't focus on them at all (mainly talking about your Aunt here).

I wish I had answers for you bud. My life is in shambles too, but one thing I did notice that you're able to do and Im not is: recognizing your achievements and potential. You mentioned being proud of losing weight and also your good grades. Focus on those things again. I know you have reasons for letting those things slip, but get them back at your own pace. You know you have the power to do so. Basically, all in all, your goal should be to rediscover your self-worth and love yourself. 

You said you're a lover of anime. How many characters have crazy stories like yours? A ton of them. I do think it sucks that many of them get over their struggles by friending someone that cares about them unconditionally but if you've seen enough anime, I know you've seen characters that fought their way up from a rough childhood to some position of power all on their own. Hell, their personality might be super positive too, not even giving any hints that they suffered 15-20 years of their life. That could be you!

My main thing is you're still so young, life changes a lot when you get older, and forge your own path. When you're not just stuck living in whatever life your family ir caretaker has created for you, and you can choose what to do, I dont know, it feels good.  

There is always gonna be pain and shitty things happening, that's just part of life for most of us. And realizing you'll never be famous or rich, and will have to work some standard job 5 days or more a week until you die is a sad reality most people have to face, or hide from.  

I wont lie and say things will be better this way or that, nobody knows how things will end up. And I know how painful and shitty life can be.  

There are almost always *some* options out there to get you out of the rut, you may not like them or may not be motivated to do it, but they exist.  

Join the military, forge your own path, see if things are better when you're an adult and in control of your destiny. (As an example)

What do you need to do? Study more to pass your test? Flashcards. This is something easy to do at stop lights, in traffic jams, while pooping. They fit in your pocket, glove box, whatever. A good flashcard should be usable by both sides. Meaning that you can study them no matter which way they are facing. Guessing flashing cards backwards is really helpful in strengthening the memory of things. Maybe you're not physically close to your friends. But you are in the grand age of technology. Video games? Video chat? FB games together? Words with Friends? Chess with friends?

I feel like people judge others experience by their age so when I started to feel down (after summer 2017) I felt I couldn’t rely on anyone considering I had friends but they were the “I’m here cuz they’re here” type I reached out to some people but they though it was a joke and haven’t took it seriously to this day. Basically I’ve been molested by my uncle when i was 8, I live in a 38 square meter apartment with 5 people including me and a big dog. My parents are mentally draining and my sister is aggressive, fights happen everyday (in which I try not to participate) police has come a couple of times. I’ve been overweight and got fit because I was dedicated but developed some eating disorder thoughts and habits which now I’m trying to work on and not obsess about what i eat and how much I exercise. Currently i workout most days unless I am sick or done like 2 hours of cycling. And eat really healthy foods just my portion sizes are big but if they were not I wouldn’t get satisfied (I’ve got a really big appetite). My grades are fine but I might not pass because of one subject in which I might fail so that’s my focus for this semester. I keep thinking I’m failing because everyday to school I have to wake up at 5:30 because it takes me an hour to get to school and back one hour so that’s 2 hours daily travelling. So typically I’m at home around 7 pm and I’m drained because I try to go for a walk to hit my step goal (10k) plus workout so before i do my homework and do the necessary studying it’s like midnight. Today I’m taking a day off because of digestion issues that’s why I have the time to write this I’ve always wanted to tell someone my story but i always felt nobody cares and it wouldn’t make sense to write it all out but I guess it makes me realise things. 

Anyway I’m getting off track just wanted to tell you I genuinely appreciate your post and I feel for you.

College is a great place to learn, I love to learn but it isn't my time. I think that we live a harder life because we are a little less fortunate. I said so but I hate to compare one life to another, but still, the fact is that it is quite a truth. I used to think that committing suicide would solve everything like: the worry about my loved ones who might commit suicide after myself or the worry that my pets not knowing that their favorite person committed suicide. Sometimes I thought I know too much about the world which wouldn't change for the better, and that's why I want to die. But I had a moment of realization that I have been living up to an expectation, and it wasn't mine, it was the majority, and because of the fear of being the minority, I forgot who I am. My whole life is filled with challenges because I wasn't one of the majority, I was myself. And so, I think again about my life, and I was able to tell myself to do something to get myself back before I want to disappear. I want to own my pain and my struggles. I haven't done any significant since I dropped out but I've been spending time with myself, to assure that I get my true self back not the imposter of myself.

If you didn't you would feel this way. Don't let mental health take you out of this game called life brother. Don't let that be the way people see you. I don't know what's it's like to go through the things you have. I don't have mental health problems, I don't have family problems, I don't have friend problems. I've had a pretty easy life. Ya maybe it's a bit pathetic still living with your parents at the age of 29 but I try not to look at it in that light. I don't like being the guy to say this but. Think of it like this, what about the tribes in Africa that have to scavenge for food so they don't starve. They don't have any modern conveniences or resources, yet they find a way to smile and enjoy life. I'm telling you bro it's the shit in your head making you feel like this way. You need a vacation somewhere where you can find that release but without the dieng part. I wouldn't know where to begin to tell you where that is. Maybe a Comicon or some public festival like that. You said you like anime. Maybe a local comic shop that caters to that genre. 

I was lost recently in life as well. Didn't know where I wanted to go, didn't know what I want to do, just generally was stuck in the mud. I was also an atheist. For about 5 years I was an atheist. I left Christianity with a bad taste in my mouth (I hope someone nails me on that joke) ((all puns intended, I know you can take me out back and shoot me later)). I found Heathenry about May of last year. It was and still and seems to be what I was looking for. The community, the faith, the way it made me feel. I had found my passion again. If you haven't been told before, look into Heathenry. It's the faith of the Norse and Viking people, if you didn't know. And you dont need to practice the faith if you don't want cuz of your current religious affiliations. But the values they hold and the aspect they look at life at is, to me, motivating. It gets me out of bed and ready for the upcoming day. It gets me through times of stress and times of strife. You mentioned you like learning. Odin is the Norse equivalent to Zeus. He is the father of all gods. Anyways not tryin to preach to ya just giving you a little background. Odin is also the god of knowledge and the stellar example of what the Norse people beloved a MAN should be. Smart, cunning, loving, stern, courageous, deliberate, loyal, strong, and most important to me, humble. I urge you to hang in there dude. 

Life isn't all that bad. I understand you have bad luck. But life is what you make it. Also those people you talk about aren't your friends even the ones you like. If they were real friends whether they're your best friend or not, they wouldn't care who they're around when they talk to you. The heathen community is very strong minded. Even if you're not interested in it, go find a heathen and talk to them. Get to know them. They'll be some of the most genuine people you'll ever meet.

He tried to commit when he was 17, my age now, but when the time came, he realized he had goals that he wanted to fight for.

Left at 18 for college and that was a struggle. I suffered from depression, felt out of place because I went to a school with a lot of people that had rich parents. I had no support I even was homeless one semester and had to medically withdraw from school for a semester because I couldn’t even function. I somehow managed to graduate even though it took me 5 years but I did it. Fast forward to now. I’m 34, and a social worker living a decent life with everything  I could ask for two vehicles, a nice home. I actually work with people with mental illness now. I still have no support as I don’t talk to my family that’s left. I’m still in therapy and I take meds for depression.

You're 16 and about to go to college? Most people go at 18 or not at all. Idk what the GCSEs are, but it shouldnt determine how smart you are. You determine how smart you are. You've been through hell and back, and it may get tougher, but you've made it this far. Why not try a few years when you're on your own and can go where nobody knows you. Remember where you came from and be better than that. Fuck everyone who has ever hurt you. Show them that you're better than them and what they did to you by succeeding and forgetting them. Work hard, and remember these days that seem like it could and should all end.  And focus that energy on being better than everyone else.

When you're able to release that from your life you will then be able to work on the other issues you have. There ain't no quick fix for depression and I doubt you'll solve all your issues before your birthday but I hope you do reconsider not committing suicide. You may believe no one cares but there is always someone that cares whether you see it or not.

I'm 45 now, it's been a long road getting here, but I can tell you that things really started getting better once I was in my 20's and I started to find a career and found I was good at it. But it took a while. I had a lot of dark times to be sure before that.

I’m having a hard time understanding your (I’m a dumb self centered American and can’t remember what Europe and other parts of the world call our equivalents our high school, collage, exams,  programs, ect) and the only reason I bring up your age is that if you are still living under someone’s authority - legally, financially, or otherwise a lot can change once you’re finally autonomous. Going back to the state of someone making my decisions for me is utterly terrifying. 
I don’t think I made my first really real friend til I was in my 20s, living 2000+ miles from where I grew up, and able to actually be who I was. I also think as you grow older, (I’m in my 30s, so I get to say this, haha) people really calm down about who they are, and stop trying to hide the fact the popularity / looks / money just doesn’t fucking matter, and start to look for people the get along with on a personal level (of course there’s always exceptions ).

I had a lot of trauma in my life too. I didn’t grow up normal, my family is still verbally abusive, on top of the wacko shit that’s happened to me. I mention this because for 17 years I was diagnosed and treated for depression, then they added anxiety, then panic disorder, then bi-polar, then schizophrenia. And today I was *finally* diagnosed with PTSD. All those past diagnoses were really common misdiagnosis of PTSD symptoms. So if you have access to a dr or therapist that you trust and have symptoms of PTSD it may be worth mentioning or asking about. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I could be way off base, and I’m not here to diagnose anyone. But if you haven’t used all services available to you to find a dr that does care, I highly suggest you do some research and try and take advantage of anything available. That is wayyy easier said than done. 

Just I think that just because you don’t have anyone close to you in your life now does not mean it’s going to stay that way!
And just because everything has been total shit so far, doesn’t mean that’s what your future will be too. 

It sounds like you really need some love and understanding. With what you’ve experienced you should be so proud of yourself just for just like standing up everyday. You sound like you’ve worked really hard despite your setbacks. But in the end grades are just letters, not a reflection of character.

depression,eophbs,fefnsff,"Please, don´t harm yourself in any way whatsoever, much less commit suicide! This is no way out, you may not believe in an Afterlife but, it there is one (and I do believe there is), it will only makes things far worse for you, believe me.

Your body is a living entity itself, and we are actually a colony of trillions of  microscopic beings who help our bodies function properly and it´s a gift from life you can only fully appreciate if you believe in certain esoteric teachings about the importance of each reincarnation but, since you don´t believe in any such things, I can only tell you that life fights for life, it´s only some sort of mental disturbance which leads someone to even consider ending one´s life.

Do search for professional help, you need it urgently, don't give up on yourself, if we don´t learn to love our own beings, we cannot expect others to love it either, and that only happens in rare situations.

Most people are self-centered, most people just think about their own needs first but if you learn to take care of your own psychological and emotional needs, you stand a chance of understanding how human nature works and you will realize human relations are too complex for us to engage in them with naive assumptions of black and white, pure good and pure evil, things being rather in the infinite shades of gray between these extremes.

Do not focus just on your suffering, try to look for those who need even more than you do, try to help animals, engage in bioethical movements, animal rights, help others with depression too, help those who suffer from solitude, hunger or abandonment, care for the environment, for social justice, for the fight against prejudice and bullying. Helping others may be your salvation and the way to find your inner strength to fight your own demons!

However, always remember that fighting depression is an endless process, it´s more about learning to be fluid, to dribble those feelings who will always try to push us down, to make us fall into despair and hopelessness. It´s a constant exercise of learning to want to live, even when everything around you tried to smash you, it's a gut feeling of wanting to breathe no matter what, of wanting to escape the talons of that which tries to take your will of living.",0

People that you see and think they never struggle, or never deal with bad stuff, do. They are programmed differently, and it's not a simple reply of; just think this way. 

Some are more existential than yourself, or at least as you currently present, and that is bleak and dismal, just like your stated perspective, but their mask is more suited for society.

Who knows, these next few months bring a change, mayhaps you will find how to change course and decide to say fuck that, I don't give this life authority over me and my actions. Then you make a new life. 

If your meds aren't working, be louder about that, there's very many out there, there's also genetic testing to find out what types will work. Or at least have a better chance of working.

I've struggled with depression since I can remember,  and I have one sister who committed suicide in 1989 and another who attempted in 2018. Another sister is extremely paranoid and is delusional.  My sister who attempted took a huge amount of 2 different pills and fell asleep on a heating pad, which produced a large 3rd degree burn on her entire lower back. She has severe brain damage and is still having skin grafts and donor skin surgeries to try to heal her back because nothing is working. Her kidneys are ruined. We had a pretty abusive childhood. Our dad fought in WWII and had severe PTSD, so I don't think he knew what he was doing to us. My mom ignored it and that was probably more hurtful than what my dad did,  honestly.  But this is the thing-- life is better when you get older.  Trust me. Stay away from drugs and alcohol,  find something you love to do and keep working with your Drs to feel better. You're in a mess of hormones right now, which Drs don't even begin to address-- don't get me started on that!--- so at least give yourself a few years after 18 to let your body get adjusted to all the hormonal crap that's going on.

depression,y9w5il,itb5j7h,"Hello! :)

Thanks so much for your answer and it actually already helps to know that I'm not alone (not that I wish this on anybody else). The first paragraph could have been written by myself. That's exactly how I feel too. It feels like everything I do is just a means to an end and I think with all that pressure it's no wonder meditation etc. is not working. Who can relaxe with all that pressure?

I think maybe as you said it's best for us not to research anymore, we already know everything, which is putting so much pressure on us. As you said, maybe it's best to focus on one thing, that could actually help us. There's so many books, so many strategies, but in the end we have to do what feels right for us. And I'm sure, deep down, we might know.

Also.. maybe that helps you too. I had a thought yesterday and it kinda really changed my view. I think deep down I have a belief that ""I'm broken, that I need to fix myself"". So I asked myself, is it true ""Am I really broken?"" And actually I came to the conclusion, no I'm not. Yes, I may have anxiety and yeah I'm scared to fall back into depression. But in the end.. that's a small part of me, but I'm not broken. And who would I be without that belief? I'd be free. There would be no pressure. No need to endless fix myself. That dosen't mean I shouldn't do anything. It's always good to grow. But I can grow slowly.

Consuming all this information, trying to understand everything, testing every strategy on ourselves, just underlines the belief of being broken.

What if we're already okay? Yes, we have difficulties in our life, but the difficulties aren't our life.

I wanna continue stuff like meditation, but I wanna try and do it without expectations or the thought of ""I need to master this! I need to fix myself!""

& hopefully at one point my whole body will understand, that there's nothing to fix, nothing to fear (anxiety). And till then I'm gonna try to be really nice to myself and not judge, if I can't do everything perfectly.

& thank you for giving me the feeling of not being alone with this. The people in my life are always supportive, but the can't understand how my life sometimes feels like. :)",1

depression,ampr9b,efnvl85,"Depression being caused by lack ot serotonin is a *theory* with little science to back it up. It's VERY important to realize this, share this, and to not accept a ""chemical imbalance"" as the sole, end-all cause for any case of depression.

Changes in brain chemistry can very well be the result of depression, not just the other way around. Exercise (*just for example*) is proven to increase ""feel-good"" chemicals in the brain. You have a lot more control over the serotonin in your brain than whether you have a birth defect or not.

I say this because accepting a ""serotonin deficiency"" or other ""chemical imbalance"" as the root cause of depression can make it much harder for an individual to get help because they're less likely to believe that they can be helped by therapy and, really, anything that's not ""meds"". When dealing with something as serious and mysterious as mental illness, it's important to not discount treatments that can be of help.",5

In my case, a lot of the stuff that sent me as deep as I am started because of a few events. Now, it’s less about those events and more about my life in general. So I’m starting to lean toward “maybe I do need these”.

depression,vtwzip,ifa11af,"aaaaand the rest:


Yo, I've had a lot on my plate. And so has he. He's carried us. I know he has. 

But everything he brings up as possible signs of mania (ha. as if) have very firm explanations. 

Example: years ago, had had a shitty mental day (and probably week.) We go to the grocery store late at night and there's a good song playing in the store. So, in a ""I'm tired of feeling like shit"" fake it til you make it, I start to boogie in the aisle in front of him. Not some big Glee dance number. Just sort of boogieing in place. 


That was one of his earliest examples of me cycling moods. 

Another example was me losing $4k (money my parents gave me-- which is not an excuse. I should have known I was too fucked up from grief and handed the money over to my husband to hold for me) daytrading over a couple of months. It wasn't spontaneous. It wasn't me chasing a high. It was something I was trying to do while still pretty fucked up by grief to try to bring in money by doing this (and honestly-- I put a lot of work into it, trying to be scheduled for early trading, reading up on stocks, organized notes. This wasn't me going to the casino and thinking ""these dice feel lucky."" Yes, I fucked up over 2ish, maybe 3 months. Additionally, I was doing my best to give my days some sort of structure, learn something new that could be profitable, and just not keep crying about how I'd give anything to go back in time. 

 Grief and money do not mix. But still-- he wants to use this as an example of mania. I don't gamble. I'm not hypersexual. I don't do shopping trips or random ass big purchases. *sigh*

Since he brought it up I've spent a few hours reading up on different forms of bipolar disorders, taken questionnaires, reading people's experiences. 

I will be pursuing some hopefully free therapy and maybe I can find someone experienced with weeding out major depressive disorder, from adhd, from the various bipolar disorders. I've been very careful to approach this in an open-minded manner, yet I also feel as though I might be seen as defensive when the list of symptoms for various forms of bipolar do not fit with my experience.


But I'm honestly starting to get a little pissed. I've spent the last 13 months of my life, actually, no wait, something like the last 28 months of my life *miserable* for very good goddamn reasons. And yeah, I've had depression my whole life, and a fucked up sleep schedule that rotates (I've only recently learned about n24), and about 6 years finally found *a lot of anwers* about why I am the way I am with adhd (still no diagnosis. no insurance. maybe the free therapist could help with that too.

This is nothing against people with bipolar disorders, or even being overly defensive with it. If I have it, I have it. I am still open to addressing it with a professional because while my husband cannot see inside my head or my 24/7 existence, similarly I cannot always observe the ways I act-- like irritation for example.

 When he initially brought it up years ago, I looked into it because I trust him and I wanted to give his opinion the benefit of the doubt. I looked into it a lot (adhd: love to deep dive and read everything on something new.) I really didn't identify with it at all. Yes, depression overlaps. Yes, adhd overlaps. I'm also an introvert, and sometimes a charged up introvert can be surprising. 

All in all, as much as I love my husband, he has different needs. He needs stability because of his childhood. I have always craved a more rootless existence. But he says that's running away. Or that eventually I need to grow up.  The world's kind of crappy and we can die whenever. I know I've made bad decisions and often live life financially by the skin of my pants (not spontaneous spending. Definitely was addicted to restaurants pre-covid though.) When he initiated the breakup/separation, I was surprised that he did it. I don't think I ever would have broken up with him. And I'm not mad at him. Not at all. I'm crazy proud of him. Breakups are awful. And he had every right to breakup with me over mental health issues. 


But since then-- a lot of my depression has lifted and I'm starting to feel hope again. I'd still like to be with him at some point in the future, but however we craft that romantic relationship (if we do) I *do not* want to be like it was before. I just want to burn down our old relationship, take a huge step back, both of us get therapy and grow and figure out what we want *now* versus something we might feel influenced into by 10 years together previously. 


All of that being said:

I did something really cool today. I wired in (complete with soldering and heat wrapping because I didn't have the money to spend an extra $30ish on adapters) a brand new (cheap) cd player to my car. I had to keep testing it and fixing stuff and I honestly did a fantastic job. And even though it's not as good as my old cd player (which crapped out. it's just kenwood sucks and that was the cheapest off the shelf radio I could find) it's still music. 

And I haven't had a lot of music in my life in a couple of years. I kind of want to tear up with how much it means to me, especially in the same car I've had since I was 18. The same car I spent so many hours in with my dog, carefree (and yes, sometimes depressed too.)

I went out today after getting it installed and was playing a bunch of 90s music and I was *happy*! I was singing. I did some seat boogies at one red light. But there was also a shadow over me. Because now, anytime I'm happy I hear what my husband would think: that this is the mania of a bipolar cycle. And it kind of crushes me a little. Because there's a good reason for me to be happy, just as there were very good, external reasons I was sad (beyond normal brain chemistry woes.)

And I get back to my friend's house and grab a tablet that I guess is signed in to my husband's gmail. And I click the google tab to search something but before I type anything, a huge list drops down and this is what it said:

*Bipolar need to escape*

*why does my spouse run away from home*

*bipolar spouse running away from home*

(some twitch searches)

*bipolar breakup cycle*

*bipolar women and bolting*

*bipolar wife keeps running away*

*bipolar spouse always moving to new cities*

*bipolar spouse always leaving town*

*bipolar and secretiveness*

(search for a sandwich shop, lol.)


I didn't go digging for this. I didn't go into his email. But damn. 

Maybe I have a form of bipolar disorder. I don't think I do based off of what I've read so far. But I was already planning on going to a therapist as soon as I found a free one since I'm broke. And I know he's reeling emotionally. But I am both sad and pissed. He has PTSD, adhd, probably CPTSD from his childhood, and depression. But he wants to paint everything with a bipolar brush because of his dad and uncle (and one rather toxic female in his extended friend circle.) And, it also feels a little bit like projection-- he went to his own free therapist for the first time this week (super proud of him for that too.) Why can't he focus on himself and his mental health issues?

It's not hyperbole to say I've had to focus nearly entirely on myself to claw my way out of the deepest depression I've **ever** experienced. And still, once I do start to feel some breathing room, bam! Any happiness I feel, I now have to automatically suspect is a manic phase even though I don't think my symptoms line up (except where depression and adhd overlap.)

I don't remember the exact quotation but there was a scene from the tv show *Supernatural* where one of the main characters has a one night stand with a waitress. And for whatever reason, he's pissed off in the morning and is trying to get rid of her quickly so he says some really nasty, insulting stuff to her-- like she was easy trailer trash with low self worth or something. And she had a real calm response. Something like: ""I know you don't really mean that, and I wouldn't believe you even if you did, but the worst part is that even knowing that, that occasionally some part of me will look back on this moment and feel that maybe you're right.""


:/ 

so...uh...yay happy manic enjoyment of 90's music after not having cars with radios for a long time?",1
depression,vtwzip,ifadlm4,"Well my life isn't that great by a lot of metrics, but also really great by other metrics. However, depression, anxiety, executive function disorder (freezing and not being able to do the interim steps between where you are and what you want the end goal to be-- even to stupid simple things like ordering a pizza), rejection sensitive dysphoria where criticisms by authority figures, even if I don't respect them, make me doubt myself but only in very specific work-related capacities. 

Those have definitely messed up my/our financial security. 

Insofar as the label, it's not so much that especially since maybe I'm unipolar (but I'm pretty sure that's just major depressive disorder with no mania.) 

It bothers me at this moment in time because:

1. The first time he mentioned it was when I was trying to shake myself out of a funk by doing a little dance to a fun song in a grocery store at night when no one was around but him and I. It felt absurd then but I looked into it and didn't give it a lot of credence. However it did make me think badly of him that he would see a tiny spark of joy and in his brain alarma of ""Mania! Mania! Mania!"" would be blaring. 

2. I realize there are a lot of comorbidities with mental health. For example, I have checked out books on autism (because I've always felt ""outside"" and I feel like while I have an excellent social mask, I do wonder sometimes why my feelings seem different from other people's), and have been reading about sleep disorders. Obviously no one wants any of these, but when I was discussing these with him-- I *thought* he was listening to me. If he wants to be so focused on what is going on in my fucked up brain instead of researching his own mental health issues, I would personally think just maybe he'd look into those? (sorry for snarky. I'm not snarky at you.) I did actually look at his search history for the past week and in terms of mental health search terms it's a *ton* of bipolar, a tiny bit of paranoia, some depression, generic ""mental health issues"", and some adhd. But when I say bipolar searches...maybe 60,80,100? just a lot. and the others 2-8 each. But nothing about what I had mentioned and that made me feel like my opinion, my lived in experiences that I am trying to stumble to explain (much like before I had the lightbulb moments with parts of ADHD being explained to me via articles) were ignored. That hurts and it makes me angry especially because I feel if I don't agree with him then that means I'm defensive.

3. He also told his therapist to evaluate him for bipolar disprder. Which, sure, go wild with the evaluations. But he meets the symptoms even less than I do. So then I wonder if it's some weird hangup from his dad and projection because he's scared of turning out like him? I don't know. But it sucks for both of us. 

and

4. I've never had suicidal ideation before this 2+ year time period. But, like I wrote-- many external reasons. I wasn't suicidal but it felt like if things didn't change then months or years from now (or rather, then) it could be a threat. I would say in the last 6 months the SI has gone down 90%. I don't think it's all gone. But after my husband broke up with me, as awful as that was. It took about two days for me to feel like ...okay-- I want to eventually get back together with him in a completely new relationship and this will give us both time to step back and work on ourselves. He is/was a wonderful husband. But there was often an element of feeling stifled even though he was rarely the influence of that. It was my own bad feelings of thinking the type of wife/person I should be. 

I'm worried about response getting too long. I'm going to post this and read the rest of your response. But I have to say, I'm impressed you read it all. it was stupid long. Thank you for reading it.",1
depression,vtwzip,ifago7a,"oh I'm so glad you know the scene I'm talking about. It was so powerful and really spoke to, I felt, the ways women can get damaged even when they know others are full of shit and just taking that shit out on them. 

There's obviously other factors. Being poor sucks. And my job precovid was very feast or famine, which I think I thrived on a little because I feel like it made me appreciate even small things that I could take for granted if it was feast all of the time. But it was never enough to feel comfortable paying for insurance with a high deductible and copay (and I'm pretty disorganized with my finances.) So it's only now, after he found a free therapist and I went looking and have some phone numbers to call for myself (plus, depression is a lot lighter right now so I actually have the agency to take those steps.)


for me-- depression comes and goes. I'm not saying I'm happy it's there but I rolled with it. It comes and it goes. But to face 2+ years with not just whatever my brain chemistry is but all this external stuff that was just gut punch after gut punch... to not have that understood even though I was crying and begging to leave this situation that I was rapidly deteriorating in. (He made the right decision in making us stay. It would have put us at risk and we could stay mostly isolated at my parents house and not have to worry about living expenses. but that doesn't mean that a heavy price wasn't paid. He paid a heavy price trying to keep me together. I paid a heavy price by being scared that maybe, because this depression was different, that I wasn't going to roll out of it. That this was going to be my life now. 

So now, now I have self-doubt. I feel like even over something like the happiness from a working cd player and driving around to high school and college music...even when I *know* that's normal...that it's been tarnished because someone else is being weirdly overexuberant with the idea of what mania is. 


It already sucks having a bad (maybe horrifying is a better word) bout of depression. I'm a little gunshy because now I wonder if, having once been that low, will it be easy to slip that low again? 

And it also sucks because I probably should be miserable. My husband of ten years broke up with me. And I love him, however he's right that the relationship was not healthy for either of us even if we were devoted, and enjoyed hanging out, and loved doing sweet things for each other. There's always been the stability vs. rootless existence thing between us. And that has ground me down. (in fairness, he has travelled with me and paid for a lot of stuff [as did I] and worked on our broken down car etc. but he was often miserable.)


We shouldn't be miserable to support the other person's preference of lifestyles even if I can agree that his is the smart, responsible, ""right"" way to go. But when I stay too long in one place I feel like part of me inside is shrivelling up. I won't be able to ""grow up"" until that stops happening. Maybe that can be ""cured"" with therapy. But it also feels like one of the few non-ugly parts of my weird psychology (not ugly because it causes me to see so much of the united states) and it makes me sad that it's like he wants to force a conversion.",1
depression,mqr8ny,gui88dr,"I feel this. My niece has horrible anxiety (I’ve struggled  horribly with depression and anxiety since I was 15), but my sister freely admits she doesn’t understand because she’s never had mental health issues. Part of me is unreasonably jealous of her.",4
depression,mqr8ny,gukarty,It truly is and it sucks being told that it just gets better!,3
depression,mqr8ny,guhnpwy,"My own brain spins around these topics as well. I spent some time trying to explain it to someone lately and the only way I could was by telling them that most people have thoughts of self-doubt or anxiety about a new situation: moving, a new job, a new relationship, etc. etc. However, most people do not walk around every day of their lives with negative self talk that stems from memories that they don't even really have.

I see you, OP. I understand the concepts that you mention and know first hand what it is like to try and explain thing to the people closest to you and somehow you just lack the words to be able to do so. A large part of why I decided to seek therapy is because I am looking for the tools to not only deal with all of this myself but I am seeking a way to be able to explain to others wtf goes on in my own head. 

What I have found so far is that it's triggering me in other ways...it reminds me of childhood where I was constantly criticised, made a mockery of, talked down to, physically harmed and then gaslighted as an adult when I confronted my parents who were the primary source of all of this bad stuff and was told ""You're remembering it in a way it never was. It wasn't that bad. Don't you have a sense of humor? Can't you develop a thicker skin and take friendly teasing?"" 

But still, I rise. I am working on understanding myself for perhaps the first time in my entire life. I am working to be a better person. I am working to give myself the grace and kindness that I try to afford others in life and say that it's okay that I am angry, it's okay that I am depressed, it's okay that I am constantly anxious and wait for the other shoe to drop. I know that I don't want these things and need assistance to deal with them so that is now what I am doing - obtaining help. Once I come out the other side, maybe I will be able to explain myself better to the people that I choose to explain myself to. Or, perhaps I still won't be able to and that has to be okay too because, it's who I am.",2

They don’t understand what it’s like to wake up in the morning paralyzed by all this without any outside factors even having a chance to interfere.  Like, on a scale of 1-10 their baseline mood is an 8 and this bad moment brought them down to a 5..... but I start my day at maybe a 5 at best so then once the outside world beats me up a little, I’m even lower.  

I agree with the other poster suggesting group therapy.  I’ve been having trouble finding a group that I think fits me, but it does seem like a good idea.

I always think how it’s so strange that I just have casual thoughts of deaths almost all the time lmao and it’s not even that I want to die... it’s just a big what if and how would I. Sucks bc I know I have a lot to live for but it would be so easy if I could just die right? I hate it tbh. I’m pretty sure I have multiple mental health conditions but it’s hard to act like that they don’t affect me. I also hate having to worry if my conditions are actually legitimate on some days. 

Anyways, yes. I think about death all the time. Sometimes it soothes me knowing how easily I could just end the suffering. However, I think it’s scary how I subconsciously think up scenarios of death during every day life, like driving, grocery shopping, etc..

depression,g99heb,fosswp8,"I've dealt with suicidal thought for the better part of my life. I reached a point where I truly felt as though I lost everything. Turned 30 not long ago, mental health suffering, tied into this unnatural emotional attachment to someone, drinking life-critical volumes of alcohol and eventually turned to hard drugs.  


I wanted to die, I spent days figuring it out, went on the prominent forums seeking information and advice. I'm a felon so a gun was difficult to obtain. I woke up one day, few hours of sleep like usual, coming down off all the hard shit I was doing, and just lost the desire. I began thinking of how much I wanted to tell someone in particular I was doing it, how every other method of suicide was subject to failure and if I did this, I'd possibly be found. Thought about eventually getting a gun, sending them a message of it and that this is the end, take care and I'm sorry for everything. How much I actually cared for this person and honestly regretted everything I said and did, because they weren't responsible for why I was doing this, I just had too many issues and transposed on them.  


I was so ashamed. Of everything I had done, how I made them feel and how I truly wanted them to be happy, I never meant to do all the things I did and hurt them because I was hurt and unable to cope with unreciprocated feelings. I didn't want to die an immature homeless junkie, I didn't want to put that on anyone ever. I'm not religious and have little belief in anything other than complete nothingness post-death, I've never feared death, only failure. But it wasn't my place to do this, not to a young girl I irrationally fixated on and developed irrational emotion for. It wasn't her fault, it was mine. Even if there's nothing but dark nothingness after it's all over, no concern or worry, I refused to affect a living being because of my unbearable desire to not be around. I'd rather suffer, every day of every minute, than die knowing this is my legacy, and how I affected the world because of my misery.  


Of course I still want to die in the back of my mind. I don't know how to cope with this loss and I can't just turn around from the lowest point in my life and expect to make something of life. I have to face this misery and knowing I may never realize the life I truly desired for the end of my days. I don't know how many days I'll feel like actually not wanting to exist. But I owe it to myself, and to others to try and make something of it. I can't die like this, I can't die in all this regret and knowing I never gave it my best and let everyone down. As much as I want to cease the conscious self that continues to torment me with every single damn regret and mistake I've ever fucking made, as much as I want to paint the wall with all of those stupid choices I made in spite of the opportunity and chances provided to me, I can't do it. It's not time, not yet. I don't know what there is, but if I found reason in the deepest depths of drug-fueled misery and complete emotional volatility beyond understanding, I gotta find out what the hell happened and why I didn't go through with it. If I have to live my life in misery for the sake of others and in the shadow of the mistakes I've made, so be it. I can deal with my own misery, I can hold my hand to the flame until there's nothing but bone, but I can't deal with the thought of others in misery because of my own. I only hope that in time, things will change, and true desire to live will come to be. If not, I accept that, I accept my mistakes and will do my best to make something of life until it's time to go. I only hope that if I have to endure not much more than life of misery and regret, those who I care about will realize the best of everything they can, and impact the world in a positive way. When my time does come, I hope it's fair enough, and I'll feel everything is okay enough to leave. Nothingness is fine, one life is more than enough to experience.",3

I felt very seen about being “casually” suicidal after I read this and it was very comforting to know it isn’t abnormal and that many people feel the same. I very much diminished how suicidal I was because I never felt the overwhelming urge to do so all the time. I thought maybe I don’t have a problem like everyone else, maybe I’m being dramatic or something because I don’t *always* REALLY want to die. 

I hope it does something for you as well",3

The only advice I get is that I should visit a therapist and it's not their problem and I should stop acting suicidal. But I'm super anxious about death and it holds me back so often in life. But on the other hand I'm so tired of everything and all the evil ness that kinda rules the whole world. But then I'm having fun and a good time and I am happy, but only for a limited time. Then everything's bad again.

It isn’t even that I’m feeling like I’m not worthy of being here so much as I’m just sick of what’s happening and whether or not I can take the pain, I’m not sure I feel like it...but I’m still here.  Likely to remain so.  My brain involuntarily chooses to ruminate on death and the potential outcomes of it.

To be honest, I am disappointed with myself if I consider some kind of revenge or “I’ll show you!” as an option.  That really isn’t a good enough reason, but I guess it’s what the French might call “ennui.”  I’m just frustrated and I am seeing no solution to this equation that has become my life.  I neither have a good enough reason, nor do I have a suitable alternative.  I have no plan, no intention, but I my mind definitely flirts with the idea because it seems like a surefire conclusion to a period of such unceasing torment.  Honestly I consciously know it isn’t, but it seems like it.

I appreciate commiserating with you all on this topic.  I hear all these false narratives for what unsuicidal people think of suicidal people, but they always think it’s to stop the pain of life or something, or an acute issue.  Rarely is there anyone who seems to depict a scenario in their mind where someone just doesn’t feel they are moving forward and they just don’t care anymore.  I don’t feel any need to do it, but I am pissed that I seem to just keep going while things remain the same or get a bit worse.  Truthfully I’m not scared at all, not even slightly, but I’m disturbed by how pointlessly final it might be when I can never say what will happen tomorrow.",2

depression,g99heb,fqdwyb4,"I don’t want to die, I just want to stop existing... or to have never existed. Almost every night I go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up. I always do. The mornings vary. Sometimes it starts out ok, sometimes I wake up wondering why I had to open my eyes again. I might do something fun, or not. I might get along with my family, or have tension or fights. By the end of the night though I’m just hoping I don’t wake up tomorrow.

It stops me from doing what might make me happy, because what’s the point, I don’t want to be here to see the end result anyway. Plus, I’m 50, so my value in many people’s eyes is depleted. I don’t feel old, but to them I look old, so they don’t even give me a chance... they just toss me in the elder box & move on. 

I’ve changed my scenery, more than once, and it never helps. It always just seems like another mistake in a long line of mistakes. 

I have friends, but I don’t want to burden them with these feelings. They are amazing people & there is nothing they can say to make me feel better or live better, so what’s the point of dragging them down. Therapists are all either looking to throw a pill at it, or just ask questions & take notes for seemingly no reason. So I ask again, what’s the point?",2

depression,g99heb,fotyso1,"100% truth for me too. Plus, something inside me is somehow telling me that I don't want to die yet bc things may get better, I may get my miracle after all, I may end up in a better place anytime from today to 5 yrs from now. Also, I think my curiosity keeps me going too. I've tried to kill myself at least 7-8 times, maybe more. I always end up still here. But idk what my purpose for being alive is. There's so many ppl out there that die that want to live, and so many ppl who actually deserve to live over me. I have no talents at all, can't play an instrument, can't sing, can't dance, can't draw, can't paint, nothing artistic, can't teach anyone anything, can't keep friends, can't make friends, I feel the 3 ppl in my life don't even want to be in my life, I feel uncared for, unloved, the one person (my hubby) who made me happy doesn't even want me & if he saw what I looked like now, he'd def not want me, I'm 35 y/o & I have absolutely nothing to show for it... I'm just a fat, ugly, loser, waste of space, not worthy of being happy, not worthy of having a good life, & just so unimportant that I don't matter. 

I just NEED this pain inside of me to end. I cry everyday, & the only time that's good, is when I'm asleep, bc the dreams are better than reality. I hate myself so much. I hate my life. I regret 90% of my choices that I've made, I'm too nice for my own good so I'm easily taken advantage of by everyone. I'm a target with dumbass written on my forehead. It's like ppl can tell I'm weak & vulnerable, & so desperate to have someone to talk to or be friends with, that they pretend to like me, get what they need out of me, promise to pay me back & leave me hanging, then I'm stupid enough to let it happen again. So I have to isolate myself & stay inside to hide from ppl so I don't get used, hurt, taken advantage of, lied to, have empty promises made, etc. 

I used to be so good looking, I had confidence, I was tougher & would never let anyone do this to me, I could read ppl A LOT better, & now idk who I even am anymore. I can't look it the mirror without being disgusted by what I see, I hate to take my clothes off & see the extra 65lbs I've put on that I can't do anything about bc I can't exercise the way I want, I can't work, & I'm just a waste of a person. I beg & plead for death everyday. Yet here I am, still alive, still miserable, still EXTREMELY depressed, suffering from anxiety, PTSD, & hiding away from the world & people who can hurt me. I don't enjoy anything at all anymore except sleeping bc my dreams, even if they're bad, are still better than how I feel when I'm awake. I will never love myself, forgive myself, or ever be the person I once was. 

I'm already so low, & sick of not having any money, that if Backpage or something like that was still around, I'd consider letting myself just be used for desperate men, if they wanted to be with my fat, ugly, ass. But it'd most likely back fire and I'd have to pay them.",8

I don’t know your story or how old you are, and realize you said above that U don’t want to go to therapy, but if you haven’t seen someone specifically for this yet it’s important to, especially if you’re young.

depression,g99heb,fov8w62,"My definition of chronically suicidal: I don't want to die but I think about death a lot (like 70% of the time). My suicidal ideation can become overwhelming when a negative event occurs that causes me to become emotionally overwhelmed. When I am emotionally overwhelmed that is when my suicidal thoughts take over my mind (100%) and it's difficult to see the light unless I attempt. 

(My apologies in advance if that's too detailed.) 

Yes! There is medication that can help folks with mental illness; however there is no pill that ""cures"" suicidal ideation. Right now, the meds that are available for folks with any mental illness are the same meds they have been using since like...the 19th-20th century, just slightly modified and rebranded. (Just stating an interesting fact. I'm not negating the use of meds because they work for a good handful of folks.) 

Anyway, I suggest that you watch the documentary Bedlam on PBS. It's free to watch online. It talks about the American mental health system and it's very eye-opening.

I’m lucky to have parents that support me in getting better because without them I wouldn’t be able to afford the therapy I receive now….which is not in Canada. I communicate over the phone with my therapist who’s in the USA and she has done more for me than the entire mental health system here. Mental health care in Canada is basically “damage control” meaning it was easier to medicate people to the point of being a zombie.  Here physiatrist only see you for a max average of 1 appointment, in which they prescribe you meds and never talk to you again. It takes 6 months just to even hear from a doctor, at which point they can choose to refuse to treat someone like me. “People with borderline personality disorder are to unreliable  with going to therapy, it’s not worth most doctors time.” What that really means is the therapy here isn’t effective so people stop going rather then waste their time and money when they aren’t actually being treated.

depression,1mfks6h,n6i1xkq,"Ok, you should see a doctor and therapist. Medication can help. In the meantime, things that helped me a lot (I suffered from severe depression and stood by the train tracks, not to travel):

1) start slowly with your changes and don’t expect a miracle over night

2) daily exercise for 20 to 60 minutes. I sometimes ran outside and started crying mid run. It’s normal and ok. It was a big part of my recovery. I didn’t like cardio, but it helped me more than lifting weights, I don’t know why. Helped with sleep, too.

3) I stopped feeding that inner liar that kept spilling depressing bullshit about life. This includes victim mindset and catastrophic thinking. What he says might feel like the truth, but it’s only because you’re used to his voice. It’s not truth, it’s habit and familiarity. Tell him to duck off. Get a bit angry, don’t let him bully you. This took quite some time, but it was the root cause of my depression.

4) do something that’s meaningful to you. Whatever it is (please don’t turn out to be a serial killer)

5) stop your addictions, whatever they are, e.g. social media, laying in bed all day, binge watching, screen time

Easier said than done, but possible. And get help by a doctor or therapist, if you can. Medicine can help.

3. Accepting failure. You will fail and that is normal. We can't be perfect all of the time and that's okay.
4. Therapy. If you can't organize your life and thoughts yourself, seek a therapist to help guide you and give you more tools in your tool bag to help yourself.

Lastly, change doesn't need to happen overnight. Everyone's life journey is different. People around you may seem like they're ahead and doing amazing, but you need to stop comparing yourself to them. Everyone has their own skeletons in their closet that they don't show others.

I have lived with treatment resistant depression for over 20 years. Right now, I am experiencing the least amount of depression and anxiety I can remember. That progress has come from several years of trauma therapy, which has made a meaningful difference in my life as a whole.

It is also important to remember that taking medication is not a bad thing. In many cases, medication is only needed temporarily. The most important part is staying safe and following the guidance of a doctor you trust.

Depression looks different for everyone. It can be triggered by many different things. Do not overlook the physiological side of it. During the early days of the pandemic, I was experiencing extreme anxiety and deep depression. On top of that, I started having strange physical symptoms that made no sense at the time.

Some of the symptoms were visible, like hives. Some were measurable, like a very high heart rate. Others were hard to describe. My eyes felt like they were growing their own hair. It constantly felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat. I had no impulse control. I was always overheated and sweating more than I ever had before.

Eventually, I found out I had developed an autoimmune disorder called Graves disease. My immune system was attacking my thyroid, which caused hyperthyroidism. The thyroid controls a wide range of hormones and body functions, so when it is out of balance, almost everything else feels off too.
My autoimmune disease intensified my experience with depression and anxiety, It was very bad and changed my life forever... 


Grounding Exercises
Grounding helps interrupt spiraling thoughts and brings your attention to the present moment through your senses. This can be especially helpful during depressive episodes when you feel disconnected or lost in your head. It helps remind your brain that you are here and safe. Grounding through sight, sound, touch, and smell reconnects you with your body and surroundings.

Somatic Awareness
Focusing on body sensations brings awareness out of your mind and into your physical experience. Depression often dulls the connection to your body or creates a sense of heaviness and fog. Somatic awareness can help you gently reconnect to your internal state and rebuild trust with your body’s signals.

Breathwork
Breathing exercises regulate your nervous system and can quickly shift you out of a mental freeze or emotional collapse. Depression often comes with shallow or slow breathing patterns that reinforce low energy and fatigue. Conscious breathing stimulates the vagus nerve and creates calm, clarity, and a felt sense of safety in the body.

Movement and Sensory Integration
Physical movement boosts circulation, increases endorphins, and helps shake off emotional heaviness. Depression can create a sense of paralysis or stillness. Gentle movement like walking, stretching, or shaking signals to your brain that you are alive and capable. It can loosen emotional tension stored in the body and reconnect you to vitality.

Creative Embodiment
Engaging in creative or expressive activities like dance or drawing gives form to the feelings that words often cannot capture. Depression can make emotions feel stuck or unreachable. Using the body to express what is happening internally helps you process emotions and reconnect to your sense of identity and expression.

Sensory Anchors
Using sensory tools like touch, temperature, or smell provides immediate physical feedback that you are here and okay. Depression can cause emotional numbness or dissociation. Sensory anchors stimulate your brain and body connection, waking up your awareness without needing intellectual effort.

Voice and Sound
Sound creates internal vibration that can calm your nervous system and help you feel present. Humming or singing naturally stimulates the vagus nerve and helps regulate emotions. Depression can make it hard to speak or connect. Using your voice reminds you of your existence and can soften emotional weight held in the throat and chest.",1

This is the comment of someone who is patently fearful of talking about mental health. Try to be calm. Try to show that you are confident that this will all work itself out. 

Yes, this may be a lie, but you don't know that yet. You need them to be confident that you are doing the right thing, that you are on the right path, and that you are working hard to achieve your goals. They seem unwary of instability, so you should show them how this is just a bump. Don't let on that this may be the hardest thing you've ever done. This will trigger their ""dramatic"" dismissals. 

I wish you health and happiness. And if that isn't immediate achievable, I wish you stability. Peace.",7

Said that my problem was refusing to talk to him about it, and that I didn’t like being honest. Said I learned all of these behaviors from my mother.

Worse they think you are just going through a phase and will tell EVERYONE (extended family) about it as if it's a cute thing you are going through.  

I'm sorry to say this but you gotta find someone that has dealt with or understand mental health to believe you or who can genuinely help you.

If i had so much money I didn't have to work again, I would be relieved and joyful at times, but I wouldn't necessarily be happy.

Also, i could have a new/or atleast newer car, which would make me happier as i wouldn't be anxious about my car potentially breaking down at any moment and not having the money to repair it (a current dilemma). And will always be able to afford to put food on the table.

With those things covered, that prevents like 60% of my daily anxieties of life, and allows me to focus my time on figuring out what i want to do in life and what my purpose is.

depression,vvne42,ifkspwv,Not a medical professional at all but I would definitely recommend going to a doctor and asking for a scan. Any kind of brain/head injury could cause all kinds of problems and if you're noticing significant changes to mood or fatigue etc then that might be a sign of something wrong.,1
depression,vvne42,ifldrlt,Thanks for the suggestion - I’ve already been to A&E and had it diagnosed last week. Didn’t require a scan. They just said plenty of rest & water will help speed up recovery but it could take days or weeks. Will see how I get over the next couple weeks as I start returning to normal routine. If still no improvement I may have to do as you say.,2

depression,d3645a,ezzrq7a,This sounds so frustrating. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this.,4
depression,d3645a,f00du5s,"I hear you! 

I've been seeing a psychiatrist and every time I leave I feel worse. Yesterday I decided I'm not going back to her after my next visit and I'm just glad I was able to find another one. Luckily my GP has been good but my psychiatrist has just asked me the same questions ('Are you still cutting?', 'Same or worse as before', 'Have you needed or do you think you need medical attention for your cuts', 'Do you currently have a suicide plan in place') and then when she's done with that it's time to talk about medication. Every single time. I've just had enough. 

I just wanted to say that I understand your frustrations. The health care system is not working for everyone but I'm really impressed that you keep trying and are at least making it work for you as much as it can. Keep fighting for yourself!",4
depression,d3645a,f00g9r3,"Yes. Talking to psychiatrists only made my condition and my mood worse. I felt like they didn't take me seriously, things they said to me were profundly insulting and demeaning. Worse than that, I'm constantly regurgitating those conversations in my mind, it steals me of time and energy and makes me angry.

I've been thinking this for a while, but I don't know how therapy is even ever supposed to work. I don't need talk, I need action, I need to change the circumstances of my life. When it comes to action, in the real world, you are on your own, always. I hate therapy, and I think the whole field of mental health should be rebuilt from the ground up.",3
depression,d3645a,f00us09,"I feel the same way too. I’ve tried it with two different psychiatrist so far. I feel like they are so fake. I couldn’t bring myself to go to second visits. 

The first one talked to me like less than an hour, just some typical questions and answers and sympathy and shits, and then prescribed me some antidepressant. I don’t feel like I was genuinely understood and it kind of made me felt bad. But I took the meds anyway as I tot it would maybe help. It did.. but for only awhile. I took them for 6 months, then I stopped. 

I went to see another psychiatrist, which was actually recommended by my clinic doctor but the waiting time is very long. Like I had to book an appointment three months ahead. So if I really wanted someone to talk to, I can’t. My depression goes up and down. And by the time it was the day of my appointment, I was in an  “okay” period. We talked about 2-3 hours, kept asking me about my past and my parents (I was really upset with them when I was younger, but not anymore now), I teared up a little (as I always would if I would talk about my really “sad” childhood), and so she kept digging and tot that was my root cause. Which I highly doubt. I seriously don’t blame my parents anymore, I grew up, I understood what they did and I forgave them. But she gave me an assignment anyway, to write a letter to my parents expressing what I felt. In the end, I never did write that letter because I don’t know what to write??? But anyway, I never went to the second visit. Because I thought I was doing better. And I felt like the lady was being too invasive?? I don’t know, I just don’t have that trust feeling with her. But who would trust anyone who they have met like once right??? 

I don’t know how this psychiatrist thing work anymore. On one hand, I hope it works, on the other hand I feel like they are doing this because this is their job and I pay for their time. So they had to be nice to me and talk things with me. Or maybe just sell whatever meds they think I need. I have so much distrust man. But anyway, not looking for the third one anymore. Gave up. 

Anyway, felt better for a few months, and now I’m back in this hellhole again. I don’t feel like working, exercising, or going out of the house. I get upset with my bf who is always on the road. I feel lonely. And I try to provoke him into an argument then tell him the world would be so much better if I just died. He would just say he needs to go to sleep and good night. And never read the rest of my messages. Then I feel so shitty afterwards. And feel so lonely. I know this will pass, but man, this exact moment is so painful to go through.",3

depression,d3645a,f00srk4,"No, actually. My GP is also a psychiatrist which is why he has been helpful. He didn't prescribe medication because the psychiatrist that I saw specializes in post partum so she knows better about medication and breastfeeding. I've never felt like I could talk to the psychiatrist very much. She's always been robotic ticking away things on a list but never commenting on my answers or digging further. So I'm not in fact complaining about being referred, I'm complaining because the supposed expert hasn't actually helped me. Don't you think after 4 months she should ask me more about what I'm thinking? Give me coping strategies? Help me set goals outside of swallowing a pill every day?   

In terms of seeing a GP, at least where I'm from, you need a referral for a psychiatrist FROM the GP (or go to emergency) so I absolutely applaud OP for fighting for themselves.",1

depression,vqupcg,ierz3fx,"Hey friend, relationships are a challenge and it seems like your starting to get more in tune with your emotions and are self-reflecting alot. I'm glad your looking internally, I think the anger may come from just you feeling used. Used by everything/everyone and maybe that high sex drive was your attempt to cope with the emotional pain you were going through and it suddenly disappeared because you were transgressing on yourself. My suggestion would be ... be patient with yourself and the person you want, be open with that person and try to work together. Relationships aren't easy and you seem young, around my age so the experience you have is probably limited. Be patient with yourself and protect your energy, don't allow strangers to constantly come back and forth build that inner sanctity. Easier said then done but if you want to make things work then I'm rooting for you. It won't be easy but you seem determined and willing to fight for the person you love. Remember you acknowledged that you both have baggage, patience is your best friend peel back those layers and thank you for being vulnerable. I wish you the best.",1

depression,wtupwi,iogixe7,"I read a comment on Reddit once that might help give some insight. This person mentioned how they used to have a job they really liked because it was incredibly satisfying, however the stress level was just too much and terrible for their health that they had to leave. Afterwards, they found a job that was nowhere near satisfying but the stress level was so low that it helped their health a lot. They reasoned it with the fact that even though it isn't a job they care much for, at least they have the option of finding satisfaction elsewhere in life while maintaining a low stress level career.

While letting go of a job may be really stressful, keeping ones that decline your health are probably even worse. And while you'll never know the outcome of your decisions until they really happen, it might be better being able to explore those options than staying in an environment where you know this isn't the place you want to be in. 

I completely understand where you are coming from, I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I know a lot of this is like.. easier said than done and may even feel like you KNOW this is the right choice but it's hard to do- all of that is valid. Just know I feel for you, your struggles are valid, and I really hope that whatever I had to offer is helpful to you.

This can also qualify with depression. It sounds like you desperately need some time off. It sounds like you dread every single waking hour which is awful and I feel for you I truly do.

On the days that I was off work, my wife would go to work and I’d be home for the day and I’d spend every waking moment playing games until she got back. She’d come back home and I’d be sitting naked at my desk with absolutely nothing done. Wouldn’t eat, shower, empty the cats litter box... nothing.

It sucked.

Eventually this depression ended up being the catalyst to a cascade of other things and were no longer together.

I’m in a better place now. Sadly, I needed some radical life changes to get my mind in a better place. Filed for bankruptcy, been evicted twice.

depression,lzvav6,gq5m84v,"I've been so angry/empty lately that I don't even want to game with my friends. I'm just seething all the time about my position in life currently. 

That being said; I have found a few things that have kept me chasing the days... 

A lot of my depression seems to stem from self-esteem issues, and feeling buried in work. I decided recently to challenge myself to try cooking my favorite foods from restaurants, at home. Thanks covid... I started making by making homemade Chinese takeout, and it was fucking awesome! It made me realize two things... One, not only how easy it was, but Two, how happy/impressed it made people I shared some with. This led down a rabbit hole of foods, which evolved to making healthier versions for my fat ass. Yesterday, I had cauliflower ""hotwings"", and I've never enjoyed a cruciferous veggie so much. And as a disclaimer, I don't have motivation to do this everyday obviously, so I plan all week, and knock one or two awesome meals out on the weekend. That also let's me food prep some stuff for the next week, which seems to alleviate part of my second big depressor; being buried in work.

Having meals planned, even for half the week (one meal per day), also lets me spend a few minutes per day being more productive. It lets me do laundry on Monday, vacuum Tuesday, and do dishes Wednesday. By spreading out smaller, less time consuming tasks, I have actually been able to stay focused and get more crap done. If my week goes well like this, I enter Friday/Saturday/Sunday with very little basic chores to do, and more time for myself and projects that I WANT to do. Or, just plain ol' guilt-free gaming with the crew. 

It doesn't work every week, by any means, but maybe you can formulate your own stress-reliever schedule based on your needs. I hope you reclaim your passion in life soon!",2
depression,lzvav6,gq5xs14,"It worked for me for most of the roughly 15 years I've been noticeably depressed, but at this point I think it's largely ceased to help.

I'm currently playing either Baldur's Gate 3 and Path of Exile, but they can only hold onto my attention for like about 2 hours before I feel restless.

I've gotten so bad lately that I'm not even sad or having suicidal ideation, I'm just numb. I try to force myself to do things I used to enjoy, like video games, but it's hard. 

I had a decent period with Cyberpunk 2077 and I've put 7 hours+ into Yakuza 0, but I had to force myself to get into both games at first.

Do you have a therapist or a GP you can talk to about this? Get some support to a daily schedule so you're kept busy and you aren't alone? I realise that's not an option for everyone, but I think it's very difficult to attempt keeping myself moving when I have no fight left in me.

Do you have a pet or a neighbour's pet that you could take for daily walks? My dog is my only actual motivation for even getting up in the morning and going to bed at night, so maybe that could work for you as well?

If it's a type of anhedonia that you're going through, I think the only way to break out of it is fighting back. Not that that has worked for me at all so far, but just attempting something different might have a chance at success.",1

It was devastating because, early on, he would blow me off for the game and (struggling with depression myself), I took it personally. He ignored his dog, his chores, everything. Fortunately, we recognized it as avoidance behavior eventually.  


It took boundary setting by me and helping him build a strong support system to really start to come out of it. Now he plays about an hour a day.  


I never had a gaming addiction, but I have a YouTube channel on mental health where I do vlogs and celebrity interviews. I was thinking about making an episode with him about this topic because not many people touch on it. Would you (or anyone else on here) be open to talking about this so I can tailor the content?

I know it is quite an unhealthy coping mechanism . I myself have serious mental health issues but sometimes I try to cling to healthy things . I feel good that u already have a therapist because I am struggling to have one. Although your therapist must be knowing you really well and must have already suggested you some healthy coping mechanisms but sometimes when you feel a little better than what you usually feel, u can try out some healthy coping mechanisms that I am trying to cling to these days. These are: 

\~ Reading books, painting, drawing, trying a new activity, writing good stuff in your journal , playing with your pet, listening to nice music, aroma therapy, going out on walks, exercising, taking in fresh natural air, spending time with nature, making online friends, take a soothing bath, watch funny things on the internet ( but not too much ) , dance alone with your fav music , get into a comfy place , have your fav healthy food etc.

I know it is so easy to suggest all this and just as hard to actually be able to do it. But just remember all of us who commented for u and who  will be always there when u need a friend. Moreover we all believe in you and you should too. Try your best to cling on !

Whereas if you find some hobby which includes more skill which you can build and where you see your progress and there is always something new you can learn, can be much more rewarding.

depression,lzvav6,gt3e644,"Hey man.

Came across your post and I could relate.  I just got off a 1-week gaming binge playing Apex Legends the whole day, every day, from waking up to going to bed.  I started the binge because the pain became overwhelming and I had to distract myself from thinking about my problems.  My problem mainly stems from the fact that I'm unable to discover my purpose: some great project/idea to commit my life to.

I've accepted gaming binges as a part of the difficult period of life I'm going through now (I'm 23m, not sure how old you are).

I understand how impossible it feels to try to think about your problems and find solutions to them.  Believe me.  The psychological pain is so great I think I would rather self-flagellation.

But you must do it.

Here's what I do.  I rent a desk at a co-working office.  I go there with just my journal and my pen.  I sit down at my desk and force myself to think and write for at least 3 hours.  Those 3 hours are absolutely brutal.  Suicidal thoughts dominate most of it.  But at some point during a typical 3-hour session, my mind drifts to thinking about potential solutions to my problems.

This has helped me a lot.  I have not yet resolved my problems but, simply making this effort of putting myself through the pain of trying to work through them, has given me a lot of confidence in a time when my self-esteem is in tatters.

This may sound cliche but it's true - the only way to address the pain is to face up to it.  Spend several hours thinking about potential solutions to your problems, no matter how painful it is, without distracting yourself with video games or YouTube or whatever.

You can of course keep playing video games (I'm certain I'll binge on Apex again some time in the future), nothing wrong with playing to help take some pressure off bad thoughts, but I believe that depression can only be solved if the person actively works on their problems, every day",1

The place I live is like a care home, all of my neighbours have some kind of mental health issue - eating disorders, paranoia, schizophrenia, you name it. There's staff every day except after 10pm.

Every single day I am reminded of why I isolate myself and every day I am reminded of how fucking lonely I am. But I can't break the cycle even if I wanted to. I *know* I'd be better with people around me to share a laugh with, but I also don't have the energy to be social at all.

I **know** that I need socialization and I **know** I need friends, because the lack of socialization and generally people in my life has been worsening my depression.

If I wasn't both socially awkward and constantly doubting myself, I might have the courage to ask people to interact with me more and the loneliness wouldn't be so hard, y'know?

You still have the potential of a great life ahead of you and the potential for it to fill with many friendships and relationships if you let it. The fact that your family loves you is wonderful, too. Some people don't even have that. 

As for the blogger, were you at all close to her growing up? I know this is going to sound counter intuitive, but maybe you could reach out to her and let her know you are going through the same things. Also, be kind to her and let her know that what she was brave; turn that jealousy into positivity. Maybe if she opened up to you and you could talk about it, it could make you feel better. Even though you are at such different places in your life, you are still equals.  

I still know where you are coming from, though, and I hope you feel better about it soon! :(

depression,2u2de1,co4irlb,"no one is immune from depression. It doesnt discriminate, dont feel crap. Try and be empathetic. Depression can have absolutely nothing to do with how good someones life can seem externally. Internal hell is really that. Its torture, no external perfection of life can prevent it. No matter how many friends or loved ones someone has, people can still feel completely and utterly alone and lost in the universe.

Dont feel bad, dont feel jealous, they can be in just as much (if not more) pain than the rest of us. Dont think about if people will or wont care if you are gone. We are all struggling in this world together. Loneliness and despair can be invisible and doesnt necessarily make logical sense. Dont ever underestimate someone elses pain, because of outside appearances.

Having said that, I want to say you are not Nothing. You are yourself, there is only one person in this universe inside your head and inside your body. You are not nothing, you are you. IF you want to talk about yourself, tell me about yourself, PM me. You are not nothing, you have your own thoughts, feelings, views, experiences. Depression can hit the highest and lowest of us.

depression,2u2de1,co4uekl,"Hey there Aoinaoko,

I can relate to both you and her. There were different times in my life when I was in your position, and times when I was in hers. The types of depression were a little different. 

I remember going through a time of self-loathing. Lots of thoughts of suicide and being completely desensitized to..... well... everything. Especially the good. I'll never forget playing some icebreaker game with ""friends"" and being told to describe ourselves in one word. In a split second (*snaps finger*) the word ""pathetic"" popped into my head. I thought ""pathetic piece of shit"", but then I reconsidered when I argued that most people notice a piece of shit on the ground and try to avoid it. I ended up saying something dumb and generic like ""funny"". I would walk through school looking around at people, hoping they would just make some eye contact, but absolutely certain that they wouldn't. When I stepped into each class I would start with stuff like ""Yup, no one acknowledged your existence"", ""You could probably just die"", and ""Confirmed: no one cares/you're already invisible"". Those were dark times. I get it.

I really fought through things and after a couple of years really found happiness. It was genuine, and it attracted tons of people. Because of going through such an intense bout of depression for such a long time, I knew that it was easy to cover up, and you never knew who was depressed. All I wanted back then was for people to acknowledge I existed, so I would try to make eye contact, smile, nod, and greet people just to let them know they existed. I let people know that I used to be depressed so that they would know that things got better. Those, among other things, eventually led me to becoming one of the most popular people in college. I was a top student, heavily involved, invited to too many things I had time for, desired by both genders and all ethnicities, and have since moved onto very nice post-grad plans. Literally thousands of people knew me. Yet, no one did.

Round 2/Post grad: I am alone. I made life choices that I felt were good for me, yet they hurt other people. I felt like I wasn't always being true to myself, and in the attempt to do so I made huge huge mistakes. I have learned so much, but I was this ""highly ethical/moral person"" who had broken the trust of a lot of friends/peers through my mistakes. I was a leader in my community, and I lost the trust and respect of some many people I held close to my heart. Though I'm open about my mistakes and am working to make amends, there is a crippling feeling that I've been hung out to dry and completely abandoned. It's hard to have ""thousands of friends"" and be ""super popular"", but realize that no one is reaaally there for you in the hardest of times and when you make severe mistakes. Even when you open up about it, peoples responses seem automated and disingenuous. No one really follows up and asks you how things are in a couple weeks. When you're popular, you quickly realize that it's one thing to be known. It's totally different to be truly cared for. 

I'm trying to cut out of the public spotlight and popularity to just find a couple people who truly care for me. It's depressing because.... well... they're hard to find now. My depression now isn't about self-hate or feeling like I don't exist. It's simply that I don't have the will to get up. I have no motivation or desire to fulfill life dreams. Happiness seems so bleak and overrated. There's and intense lens of cynicism to relationships and purpose in life, and life feels so.... empty. So much seems for naught, and it's hard to believe that people will ever truly care after losing everything. 

Yet..... I know I'm wrong. I was wrong when I was in middle/high school, and I know I'm wrong now. That's the big difference. I know this won't last, just how I know yours won't last either. We do have to be proactive (Yay us for posting here! It's a start!), but it will get better. Just.... when it does.... make sure you really stick to and nurture those relationships with people who care for you. It's a regret I have now, that I hope you won't have to live with years down the road. 

Ok...... way too long. *Huuuuuuuuuugs*

That doesn't mean it's not one that deserves attention, but I feel like a lot of people use words for serious mental illness to explain them just going through a though time.

I have an overall feeling like I just don't want to do anything, work, school, socialising, boring daily life tasks, etc. This feeling is also coupled with a heavy feeling in my chest all day.  But I do these things anyway because I know I have to. If I don't work I'll be homeless. Plus I do love my job. With school, I want to finish and surprisingly enough I have all As at the moment. Even though my life from the outside looks pretty good, I feel empty and think about suicide often, though I don't have a current intention to do anything about it. I have tried before, failed and told myself I would never try again. Noatter how bad it got.

By day, I'm a geophysicist, I've run half-marathons, I 'have' hobbies (which I don't do anymore) and I'm on anti-depressants. I find that because I'm clearly a high functioning depressed person, people don't take it seriously and consider me to just be 'unhappy.' Most days I just want to lie in bed and say, 'Fuck it,' but I live in Canada on my own (my family is overseas) and so I have no choice but to drag myself to work and force myself to face the day. I think that makes it worse in a way.

I read that high functioning depressives are more likely to commit suicide because they're so atypical in their responses to depression, i.e. it doesn't seem like such a bad case.

I'm kind of gutted that I'm falling back into it right now. I quit my job that I considered to be the ultimate source of my depression (started over two years ago, long hours meant I had less free time to myself and for my hobbies and my stress levels massively increased).

I feel like there's nobody to talk to because it seems like they just want to ""fix"" me. My husband gets mad and asks what I have to be sad about.  I would talk to my mom but she has enough to worry about,  she's listened for years and I don't want to burden her with this anymore.  I try to hide it from my 14 yr old son but he knows.  I worry that he suffers a bit too because he asked one time why he was sad all the time. I don't want him to feel like that, I know how hard it is.  
My son and my mom are the main reason I'm still here, some days it's just too hard. But I can't leave either one of them, my mom has me and my brothers but she and I are definitely the closest. I couldn't bear to leave my son alone with my husband, he's a good man but he just doesn't understand a lot, he's in his own world that centers on his mom.

The fact that I turn up washed & in clean clothes seems to indicate that I'm fine - they don't realise that it's taken the best part of 3 days to do this.

depression,504py2,d7194pq,"I understand. I've had anxiety for forever, which has led to (increasingly frequent since graduating) depression streaks. However, my anxiety also gave me perfectionism (or rather, the idea of people thinking I'm lazy, dumb, etc, makes me anxious) and so on the outside it would be quite hard to tell what I've been doing through.

I didn't realize I had depression issues until after graduation because in school my success was enforced by anxiety; people might think less of me if I fail this class. My parents will think less of me if I drop out. My professor will think less of me if I walk in halfway through class, so I can't be late.

That's how I got one of the most valuable degrees in the world. But now that I'm past this part of my life, there is no clear direction for me so depression is taking over.

I hate my life and my job. But now instead of anxiety pushing me to improve my life by doing well in school, anxiety is holding me back-- I can't quit another job, I've only been at this one for a few months. I can't go to grad school, I will make less money.

To top it all off, I feel drained and lazy the moment I get home from work, so I can't pursue my passions on my own time. I have all these dreams, and the skills to reach them, but not the mental state that I need. And hence, depression.

Antidepressants have helped, to some extent. I no longer constantly fantasize about suicide. I even feel okay most of the time.

depression,504py2,d71p6hc,"I feel guilty sometimes bitching about my depression, especially relative to other people. I've never missed a day of work because of it, lay all day in bed, had a panic attack, neglected chores, etc. I'm working on bettering myself by picking up new hobbies, meeting new people, and improving my fitness. There's nothing I haven't been able to accomplish because of it, I don't think. 

But I also have intrusive thoughts about suicide and self-harm in response to minor set-backs, and something in the back of my head that constantly tells me I'm worthless. Nobody I haven't told outright about this has any idea. I don't even bother hiding my scars, but people don't pay attention or care anyway. ",10

depression,504py2,db8l6me,"fartingaround, depressed people can get a significant other because of their attitude. I have depression, and I fight it, I am not depressing to be around because I work at it, and very hard. So very hard. I am married to a wonderful husband, and when I ask him about it, all he says is that he loves me, and sees that I work at it, and that I deserve to be loved just like anybody else. He sees how it robs me of strength, time, energy, and joy, knows he can't really understand how I live with this and still smile.

the hardest part about depression is learning to live with it so you can manage to still live a life. I can smile, joke, laugh, play, and enjoy life, I can do all this, but my illness prevents me from doing this all the time. or some days it can completely debilitate me. rendering me so useless that watching youtube videos all day is all i can do to keep me from killing myself. no one sees this part of me though, and its not that I actively hide it, but when I seek people to be around them, I myself, don't want to be talking about how horrible I feel, I want it to end, and need them to help me distract me from myself. It works most of the time. When I do talk about it, I do my best to not be in a miserable state, because I find that people tend to stop active listening, and start to pity. Pity doesn't help. Being conscience of it does.

I hope that helped. I know I went off a little, but feel free to ask questions.

I'm so glad you're getting on better now! 
We're not cured but we're able to live a meaningful life which lifts us up instead of keeps us inside all day.



I can't say this for everyone but I've had a small revelation recently that if it wasn't for mental health issues affecting me for almost 10 years (smaller part of half of my life), then I wouldn't be as grateful for as much as I am now.

I love seeing the beauty in small things, yeah while I'm in a real depressive rut I can't see the beauty in anything but when I do see it I appreciate it so much more.
If I do something that is impressive by anyone's standards, it's 5x more impressive by my own standards because I know how hard it is for me, and aren't my own standards the most important to live up to?



 

Very cliche and easier said than done but it's really nice when you focus on the positives with high functioning or even barely functioning depression, because there are some positives and you should be really proud of them. 



It's really easy to see a person with a physical disability succeed at something that is hard for them (e.g the Paralympic Games), but it's really hard for people to see mentally ill people doing well, when doing well for them is what healthy people do anyway. So it's more important than anything for us to get validation from ourselves... because you'll rarely find it from anyone else just because of how hard it is for them to see what you've done in light of your illness(es).

Sounds kind of weird for me to do that actually... 

I proper cling to people though, I kind of obsess over one person and tell them everything, currently its my boyfriend and he's honestly one of the most caring and lovely people I've ever met but I can't help but think whenever I say ""I'm feeling down today"" he sighs inside and knows he's about to go through the whole: why whats wrong, whats happened to make you feel like this, people don't think that and you know that, no I don't mind I want you to talk to me about it. 
Of course theres no reason for me to think this other than I tell him these things a lot and the fact that I'm a lazy dysfunctional burden to the people that love me- fantastic!!!!

Its so difficult because our family and friends might think we're being off but because there are little to no outward signs of depression due to being high functioning or even just functioning, nobody diagnoses you until you reach a tipping point and realise you're not healthy... Its also so hard for ourselves to realise something is wrong because the common symptoms; isolation, lack of appetite, work performance suffering, crying etc are something you're not experiencing. 


The best thing to do is stick around, I'm glad you are! Any happiness I experience after my lowest points is something I like to think of as a reward or something for sticking around, I've never made plans to kill myself but I've felt suicidal before. I often like to think back to a point where I felt suicidal and think of all the cool stuff thats happened since then, even if its just getting into a new tv show and think 'well I'm glad I stuck around for that', seems a bit silly writing down but it helps a hell of a lot. Especially because since then I haven't had any huge life events/had any big job developments, it might help you especially if you haven't tried already. Its hard to be motivated when you see no future and you're preoccupied with it but who cares about the future when you can get enjoyment out of a good film or a funny joke or a beautiful painting that you wouldn't have experienced if circumstances were different.

Therapy was good for me, it's definitely helped me evaluate my thoughts and feelings more, in a lot of situations I can recognise when I have a ""hot thought"" as they called it... It's a thought about a situation or anything that provokes the most powerful emotion in you, then once you recognise it you can start to challenge it or think about it more rationally... This was the thing that helped me the most. For example if a stranger seems uncomfortable around me I might think 'they think I'm so awkward and weird' and sometimes this would lead me to a bad mood and to isolate myself, but with the stuff I learned from cbt I can recognise certain thinking errors and emotions and challenge them.

This sounds really loser-ish but pets help me a great deal, you don't have to speak to them but they'll love you whatever you're going through and always want to be around you, sounds sad and pathetic as fuck but my cat cheers me up because she always wants to be around me and that makes me feel valued even if it's just by a cat

I'm glad you're opening up slowly, it can feel too scary to tell someone everything straight away, plus they might start to understand your problems a bit more if they aren't already familiar with depression, it can be really confusing for the lucky people. My mom said that she doesn't know what to say to people when they're depressed because she doesn't know what they're going through

depression,504py2,dbbjip6,"I'll declare I'm no doctor, but I do know some stuff, since I've dealt with this all my life. I had an awesome doctor who helped me a lot before he retired, he refereed me to a woman specialist. It's not really common knowledge to doctors, especially men.

Having an irregular period can cause your hormones to be completely messed up, and not proper diet, and exercise will solve the issue at all. (I've tried that for years to no avail) For some women I've been told that going onto the pill really works for them to regulate their cycle and keep their hormones in check, and in a few cases eliminating depression all together. 

But take note that your irregular period doesn't make you a screwed up person, and you can get help, try finding a specialist, and I've found that talking to a woman specialist really helps. (not being sexist guys, but women can talk to women about woman thing easier, just like men can talk to men about men things)

Anyone would be.  But you have to give it a shot, because antidepressants have helped many.  If for some reason it's not effective, don't worry. You have tons of other options.  Yes, it is going to require a massive amount of patience, but with time, you will see some results.


>A chest cold sounds so much worse than a head cold, 

I seem to be getting better.  I had to cancel my tutoring sessions with my students which sucks because it's the beginning of the year and it doesn't look to good on my part.  I could lose some clients.  Hopefully I will get better tomorrow.

depression,504py2,dbfmms1,"I have tried three types of birth control pill and for me personally they all ended badly, most hormonal drug treatments don't work well for me. My current doctor is trying me on an ultra low dose of a new antidepressant, and it is really working for me so far. 

I have witnessed two women though that said that going on the pill worked for them, and my last doctor says that it's typical but not guaranteed to work. which is why i suggested it. 

Unfortunately what works for depression is very individual. And it is usually a combination of things that work. But I'll tell you my coping methods of how I've coped with it for the last ten years and maybe something will help. I'll give some story to give context.

When I was a young adult I tried birth control pills three different varieties. none worked, and caused me to become very suicidal. to this day my family knows of only one real attempt, while there was more like 7. 3 of them landed me in the hospital, 2 more of them should have landed me in the hospital, and 2 more where I was so out of it I wasn't aware of what I was doing. 

My doctor then prescribed me meds which did little. After that I left my boyfriend, and left the lifestyle we had grown together for nearly two years, it wasn't healthy. Changing your environment can make the world of difference that you need. To do that change I started to cook for myself, learned about health and nutrition. these things helped a lot.  It wasn't till I started going to college that I really broke free from depression's grip, I had direction, a goal, something to focus on that made me feel productive, worthy, and something to live for. 

This is where I learned how to live in the moment, because I learned that I CAN feel things other than pain and suffering. But it is for moments, like being with a friend, someone letting you go ahead of them in line, little tiny victories, checking one thing off my monster list of things to do. Learning to live in the moment is the first step, because then you can make that little tiny moment of not pain, of not suffering grow into a few minutes, into an hour, into a day. 

I also learned to be accurate with my thoughts. Instead of saying ""everything is terrible"" I learned to say ""this moment is terrible"" and the terrible moments pass. 

Through these things I learned to live with, then get rid of depression. I fell in love with the most wonderful man in my life, and I will brag about him to anyone who will listen. and then I got a new job with a new boss, and then the train wreck of depression hit me in the face all over again. I saw it come at me from miles away and yet I didn't get out of the way. jobs were hard to come by at the time and job hunting was difficult for me, so I let it hit me, for money's sake.

I quit, I couldn't take another day of it. I found a new job, found new confidence, and was kicking depression to the curb for a second time in my life. That time it was environment that caused it. so I got a new environment. The new job was just busy work though. 

This time my coping methods grew. Now I read other people's posts on depression, it helps me not feel alone. If there's one person I can relate to and give some piece of advice, I can feel better about myself. Another thing I do is what I like to call ""visible busy work"" I clean my home, do the laundry, but rarely a deep cleaning, only what I can see and focus on. Or I'll make a fancy dinner. I can see it I can eat it, and I can share it. I also enjoy learning, so I research, and research and research. I do it for fun. I like to learn about dogs, and nutrition. I wish I was the student type person or I would be in school 
to be an animal nutritionist. 

But my recent bout of depression has a new buddy with it, panic attacks. these are new and all I can manage to do with them is to watch youtube until they become less intense. these are scary. with depression i just shut down, and wait till the moment passes. then when i've gathered enough strength I start on the things I mentioned. But with panic attacks I just move around the house, super tense, and with extremely intense thoughts on suicide. I get scared. the ONLY thing i have found to really work is to make phone calls. I don't care where or to who. Suicide hotlines, or family, or the BC medical line. I just call anyone who will answer their phone. but that only works when i've calmed down enough to even do that. 

I hope that one of my methods helps. there's more, so much more but this is already so long. I'm more than happy to listen.
as for actual treatments, I've had therapy on and off for ten years, medications for 2 and I'm just going back onto meds now.
I've done a lot of homework, and have realized that I do a form of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. You might want to look into that. the research on that is showing real progress.

depression,7i2eb7,dqvojs5,"Having parents set in there ways... heck.. having parents that are narcissist... or simply ignore there children have one thing in common.

Anything you do to harm yourself will only reinforce their belief that something other than themselves is responsible.

I used to think that maybe if I hurt myself, it would *teach* my parents a lesson. Only when I grew up did I realize their narcissistic and igrnorant attitudes would have only been made worse, and that their utter failure as parents to realize their child was asking for help and they turned their back, would not be part of their reality. There would be no guilt. Only blame. Blame on you, blame on video games, violence on tv, your friend. 

I don’t have any advice... I just happened on this sub because I’m back in a dark place in my own life. But I can only say this. Don’t you dare think hurting yourself will do anything to change your parents attitude.

I know you said your anxiety is stopping you from reaching out, mine did to (and still does to a point). But if posting on an Internet forum is your only outlet to reflect, seek advice, or just to vent until your 18, then let it be.

Only thing I can suggest is keep yourself busy. Part time job after school will help you on your way out the door. Heck, it might even help with your anxiety. Try to keep your grades up, got to college. You’ll find your world changes when you are surrounded by like minded people.

Eventually, I just went to see a psychiatrist/therapist on my own. He helped, and put me on medication that definitely helped (but not cured) my conditions.

For months i tried to call my GP each day and always hung up just as i called because theres no point. As well as your perception with depression thats nobody wants to help, im worthless and someone needs it more than me.

Honestly? You need to force yourself to get outside help. From school or preferably your GP, im unsure on the confidentiality clauses in your area or who youll seek,so it may be important to find it out to ensure you dont accidentally end up in a worse place than before.

And I'm a mature person when it comes to things like being accepting of others, open to arguments, debates, and hearing all sides.

The biggest challenge is hiding those worries from her, they will do her no good, telling her that her depression is destroying you as well may seem as a way to release your frustration, and a way to trigger her to change, but try to avoid it.

They feel lonely and without hope, if there is a very specific reason you can work on it, trying to help them see that what they see as a massive burden to their happiness is not that mayor, if it is beyond your control.

About feeling alone and miserable, all you can do is make them feel love unconditionally, but that is hard when it is not true, the reality for me, and I guess many others, is that no matter how much you love someone, if they don't want to live, and it will never change, I will have to go my own way, I still have hope, idk when I will give up.

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxa03i0,"Awwww, damn. Yes. As with anything people cannot see or experience themselves such as invisible illnesses and disabilities, they struggle to imagine it and to empathize. For regular people, anxiety is a temporary and fleeting emotion, at a much lower intensity than we experience it, for much more significant cause than for us...it's an alien concept. It does not compute. They try, but...often fall short. 

I have phobias, one of which is public speaking and naturally led to *very* public breakdowns and panic attacks...over and over and over. I never once finished a presentation without crying. Ever. It's awful, and beyond mortifying. Did teachers and professors care? With the exception of two, no (and they were Psychology professors, so likely had a hunch). 

The general public has no idea what a phobia is. A phobia isn't merely something that *scares* you or makes you *uncomfortable,* it's something that causes panic and terror that is completely irrational both in relation to the level of actual danger, and in relation to the degree of the panic and terror. It feels like I am heading to my own execution, like I am literally going to die, although rationally I know that's extremely, extremely unlikely (at least in the case of public speaking) and I would rather do something truly dangerous instead of speak in front of a group...because in my head, skydiving or whatever is *less* terrifying. I will do anything to avoid my triggers. 

Everything shakes - voice, hands, knees - I'm lightheaded and dizzy, sick to my stomach and nauseated to the point of vomiting for days ahead of time in anticipation of encountering the trigger. Excessive sweating, rapid and audible pulse, I can't breathe, there's not enough air, I can feel my heart beating under my skin, I can't help but cry, sobbing, I have to get *out*, I'm so scared I can't even form a coherent thought. 

*That's* a phobia.

I outright failed a lot of presentations, got some pity Cs which I appreciated - it wasn't *good,* but I did *try,* god damn it. I *tried.*

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxa3t3t,Most people know next to nothing about mental health and disorders. They just talk about it because it’s popular and they want to be seen as caring people.

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxanhwi,"As someone with mental illness who becomes a shit-tier human during flare ups, I think we need more awareness of the fact that mental illness can make people really shitty sometimes. People who are hurting tend to lash out. Not every depressed person is eating ice cream in bed, some of them are going to work and being dicks to everyone around them.

It sucks, but it's true. And once we accept that that's a very, very common presentation of mental illness, it makes it a lot easier to recognize what's happening and get those people the support and treatment they need.

Im not saying it's okay to be an asshole, or that you don't need to take responsibility for your assholish behavior. I'm just saying that if society was more open to accepting that that sort of behavior is a sign of mental illness, more people could be treated and there'd be fewer assholes overall.",25

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxagjh0,"RIGHT. Everyone at my job is very open minded, I’ve never heard of anybody say anything about mental health that rubbed me the wrong way. Yet the other day I had a coworker ask me why I wanted to skip my lunch break and instead leave an hour early, when I had just told her I had woken up anxious and had been all day. She didn’t put the two and two together, that maybe the reason I would like to leave ASAP is because I’ve been having an internal freak out since I woke up at 6 that morning. She then proceeded to ask me to not leave early (by one hour) because she felt “it wasn’t fair”. It’s funny because from my perspective it took everything I had in me to not call out that day, so leaving an hour early seemed like a no brainer for someone who had been having an all day anxiety attack. The disconnect is incredible.",19

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxajvb9,"Ugh, my last job, I sooooo felt this.

They were all: we can't do this without you, you all are vital to our business! And proceeded to yell at us and treat us poorly but then got confused when people started quitting. Because they didn't actually know how to do our jobs, they got super frustrated because they couldn't get someone to actually stay and learn, so they decided to give the 3 of us left the other 3 positions they couldn't hire for. My extra full time position that they didn't discuss with me was answering the phones and doing customer service. I started there to be A/P.  We manufactured chips, so of course people called to complain/emailed to complain. As I have been reading in this sub, many of you are like me in that we don't like phone conversations. And I especially can't do that position because I am VERY sensitive to others emotions and I tend to take them on. I WAS MISERABLE and I told them that pretty quickly. I said this is just something I am not capable of doing indefinitely so please, I don't mind helping out, but I can't do this forever. I have anxiety and depression, and this isn't good for me."" I was told, naw, this is how it was going to be because the owner said so. Also everyone else is doing fine with their new position. Yeah, cuz they be neurotypical, y'all! After about a week, my boss said ""see, don't you think you are improving? You just needed practice!"" He was so chipper. I burst his little bubble when I started crying and saying how miserable I was. He was shocked that I had reacted this way and acted like this was the first time I had ever mentioned it. Before I left, I just started giving them ZERO emotions and they did not like that at all. It's been over a year now at my new place, and I can't tell you how freeing it was to find someone who doesn't get angry and yell, and knows how to run their business without you. When I did my exit interview I was so angry I was bawling but I told them EXACTLY what I thought of them and it was SOOOOOOO nice.   


Also, before me, my boyfriend struggled to understand anxiety and depression. He had a friend commit suicide, and he just didn't get it. Then about 2 & 4 years ago he started having weird symptoms (involuntary muscle twitching, tingling and numbness in his legs) and a dr said oh, sounds like ALS. He was really nervous about it, but did the testing for it and it came back negative. We were told it was BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome - just involuntary muscle twitching made worse by certain things like stress & caffeine). He was fine for about 2 years (he cut back on Coke to help, and he was no longer in the stressful work environment he was in at the time) and then it started happening again. He forgot about the BFS when some other dr said MS. Then he spiraled....he was panicked that his brain was just going to deteriorate and we had just bought a house and how could we pay for it if he couldn't do his job - it was just a nightmare situation for him. There isn't a specific set of tests he can do like ALS, so it took a lot longer to rule it out. While waiting for that, he was having panic attacks at night, hyperventilating, and saying his skin felt like it was on fire and he couldn't sleep. He is a very rational person, so I gave him some rational information to calm him during these times. It very much helped him (would not help me) and after it was confirmed no MS, he turned to me and apologized. He said ""I had no idea that's what anxiety is like"" and I told him yeah, but that's my brain every single day about stupid/mundane shit. And he said he was sorry and that he really understood now. He still has struggles with understanding how depression works, but is much more open to it. People struggle to understand until it actually affects them.",12

The company atmosphere is great, but I’ve never felt comfortable telling my superiors about the anxiety or telling them it’s the reason I need to take time off. I just feel like there’s too much stigma still, or that they’d look at that as a weakness as it pertains to my job. I’ve had full blown panic attacks while doing presentations at internal sales conventions to the point where I can’t even remember what I was saying but somehow got through it.

While the intention is good, the problem comes when they do nothing to back it up i.e. provide resources (not just workshops or pamphlets), but paid mental health days and things like that. I think another issue is how people truly do not understand how deeply mental health actually runs. I feel that people think of mental health as just anxiety or depression, with very surface-level impacts on life. Like people think anxiety is just being nervous about something, while many of us on here know there is much more to it (headaches, tremors, disassociating, insomnia, and much more). The same goes for depression and any other mental illness. It's really upsetting when people actually feel comfortable talking about their mental health and everyone turns away from them due to it making them uncomfortable.

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxc4m8f,"I think it's a symptom of society at large romanticising and largely normalising mental health issues. By that, I mean that ""depression"" has become synonymous with ""feeling a wee bit sad"" and ""anxiety"" with ""I'm a bit nervous/worried"". Such issues are largely easy to address by simply talking to someone, or stepping away from your desk for a bit to do something fun. It's an easy way for the company to virtue signal with very little work needed to address the stigmas and attitudes of their managers / leaders.

It's a similar platitude as the ones you might get from friends and family - ""Feel free to talk to me any time!"". When the reality is that true depression/anxiety is a different beast altogether that can quickly turn you into a vestigal, draining lump, and there are going to be very few people who are honestly prepared to deal with someone in that state. I've lost friends when I was a lot younger over this, and I honestly don't blame them. But I'm more mature now, and know that I need to deal with things on my own sometimes.

Side note - My favourite example of the ""company virtue signalling"" that OP talked about was in my previous workplace, where they had a section of a company meeting dedicated to the importance of managing your stress levels at work. The very same week, they had contractors in, *during working hours,*  to install desks for the employees of a company that we had just acquired who would be starting in a month. Cue several days of loud banging and crashing. Beggars fucking belief; if they really, truly, cared about peoples stress levels, why wouldn't they do that out of hours?",4

They tend to think of anxiety as stress or nervousness that disappears with positive thoughts and activity and when confronted with the reality and physicality of it they can't comprehend it. Or, they think of it as a lack of resilience and a liability.

Everyone gets anxious from time to time, people confuse the feeling of being anxious to having anxiety and really don't know the difference.

I personally don't hide my anxiety from people but I won't openly disclose  it to certain people due to the discrimination I've faced in the past from disclosure.",95
Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxawoxq,I wish I had had a better understanding of depression and anxiety when I was younger. I just thought everyone else was better at dealing with the world and spent 18 years not getting proper treatment. Looking back I can't believe that I thought the things I was doing were normal.,46
Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxblmsw,"I think one of the other problems is that many people's idea of depression or anxiety (for example), are based around a singular state of being. The reality is that these things exist on a spectrum. To one person, anxiety may mean constant panic attacks, to another it may mean a persistent feeling of being unsettled in their stomach, for example. Both cases could be described as anxiety, and neither case invalidates the others, but that word in itself doesn't really do much to show the degree to which the person is suffering from it when we hear it and use it when talking to others, for example. As a result, I think a lot of people don't understand that there are going to be different extents of anxiety (and other mental health issues), and that they can also manifest in different ways, as is the complex nature of the human brain.

I completely agree with you about people not knowing what to do with prolonged issues. In my experience, people very easily do well dealing with issues that have some sort of resolution, but when faced with something that won't necessarily get better right away with their help, they start to struggle with what to do. discussing these things openly is so important to help destigmatise and help people know what to do to support those who are struggling.",34

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxduwf3,"Omg I feel you so much on public speaking. It's the worst. It's  terrible leading up to it no matter what you do to prepare yourself. I one time tried to keep from crying and ended up laughing(?) in an uncomfortable and pretty much uncontrollable way. Like it was very awkward and I wasn't being coherent with my word because of trembling, dizziness, and this basically cry laughing. Afterwards I ran out of the room and couldn't stop the panic attack spiral. It's so embarrassing. I couldn't face anyone for a long time afterwards and didn't feel okay for weeks. 


I am finally in a better place with my anxiety but I do take meds. Public speaking has gotten better (but not easy) over time. I had a job that required me to be in front of a classroom teaching a group of adult students training for my field. I did it for 3 ish years and with that repetition was able to get a little better with handling it.


I had an employer once hold a staff meeting where they played my recorded work calls for everyone to listen to and critique. Everyone had input on how I answered the phone, what I said, how I said it. This was not a call center or anything but a dental office. I cried the whole time and wanted to leave the room so badly. I was blind-sided and felt singled out. Then I had a meeting with just my bosses who told me that I was being very unprofessional and I need to participate. I tried explaining my anxiety but they seemed to think I was being immature and dramatic and said they would be doing it again at the next staff meeting. It sent me into a spiral. I could barely make myself so to work and I called in a few times due to panic. I eventually left a job that I used to love because of my mental health.",3

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gytsjax,"Is your job related to mine? haha

Basically the same happened to me, went to HR about it because at a meeting (a meeting solely focused on me I might add) the supervisor told me something along the lines of ""because of your anxiety attack, the staff was focusing on you instead of their job"" with the manager there hearing it and not even flinching at what she just said. Of course when the HR confronted them they were like ""I dOn't rEmEmbEr thAt"" and only got a slap on the wrist and ""mental health training"", even though I also reported her on much worse shit she has done while the manager was just being a bystander. 

Honestly try to gather physical evidence as much as you can next time, companies care only to cover their asses and if you have recordings or copies of emails of shitty stuff the management said or done, it can be used against them. I made up my mind that next time if there's a meeting regarding my health or anything on my next job, I will request to record because I don't want to go through anything what I've experienced ever again.

I could practice until I was blue in the face, know my material backwards and forwards, it didn't matter. I practiced for seven hours straight for a ten minute presentation once, *desperate* to get through it because it was worth so much of my grade...nope.

Deep breathing, focusing on one person, looking at their foreheads or above their heads or imagining them in their underwear or trying to pretend they aren't even there...none of that works. I had to take a public speaking class as part of my major in college. The professor felt sorry for me and offered remedial private lessons after class. It did not help. Nothing helped. It was hopeless. 

My boss is a therapist; I was explaining one-on-one to him one day how it makes me feel and just doing that, just *thinking* about it, put me right in that place - shaking, crying, sweating, wringing my hands trying to talk to him. *Mortifying.* Ugh.

Re: affecting your life, unfortunately, my second phobia is a driving phobia. Same deal. I am nearly 27, I never did get my license. I did put in the practice, almost two thousand hours of it over four years. It never ever improved even the slightest bit. Throwing up in anticipation of driving throughout the week, unable to think of anything else, muscle cramps in my back, neck, legs and shoulders within minutes of getting behind the wheel, gross overreactions to things (like thinking someone pulling into my lane was going to hit me and swerving or hitting the gas out of fear), panic attacks, shaking, etc. I did professional lessons, like a dozen. I did everything I was supposed to, practicing in empty parking lots and on roads at 3 am. Nothing helped at all. I am a nervous driver to the point of being an extremely dangerous driver. Completely overreacting to things, thinking people merging into my lane will hit me, just terrified, you know? Lots of near accidents. I also have brain damage which is the root of my anxiety, etc and have trouble with spatial awareness and judging distances, reaction time, multitasking, paying attention to multiple things, the memory required...

I quit after four years, gave up and cut that source of stress out of my life and have been happier ever since. It was not worth it. Not driving is my service to humanity. I pay my parents and friends to take me where I need to go, take Uber or Lyft or public transportation. But my mother has recently been pressuring me to get my license in order to move out - I saved up enough for a down payment on a condo specifically because those condos are directly by the light rail and my work is literally two seconds from lightrail too so that's the bulk of my travel covered, but if driving is a prerequisite...that's another matter. I started antidepressants a few months ago and the prospect is slightly *less* paralyzingly terrifying than before, but ..still terrifying.",13

When I'm anxious, a loud, unexpected sound will send me into an uncontrollable rage and I'll have to shut myself in a quiet room so I don't rip the heads off of everyone around me. I'm a woman, so luckily, people generally do see this as a sign that something is going on with me and try to have patience, but for guys, it's just like ""angry men will be angry men"" or ""maybe you should try anger management"" rather than ""this looks like untreated anxiety.""",14

Their point was that instead of accommodating those who are mentally ill when they can't keep up with the standards set by neurotypical people, our culture punishes them because all everyone else sees is a decrease in productivity and profits rather than a fellow human being who is struggling to get through the day.

Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxeo3fb,"Someone with depression might have an episode and go on a tirade about the negativity accumulated, telling that they want to die, that the future is hopeless, there's nothing to live for etc. In my opinion that's a toxic trait directly derived from depression that many people tend to not want to deal with unless someone is knowledgeable in this stuff (be there for them, assure them, even get them to hospital if they need it). It's not abusive unless the person in question starts to threaten and use manipulation tactics to control others for their own benefit eg. ""If you break up with me I will kill myself""",1
Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxeskw6,"Eh, I disagree with you on that one. Regularly venting to someone that they’re suicidal is definitely abusive. It’s traumatic to have that kind of responsibility put on another person. Talking about it once, the first time, to someone that they are *very* close to could be okay (definitely *not* to causal friends), and then seek professional help so the therapist can bear the burden of that would be appropriate.

A therapist had the tools to handle that kind of crisis.

But regularly venting about suicide to someone other than a therapist? That’s abusive. It’s traumatic for the other person and not okay. No one is obligated to endure that kind of trauma.",1
Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxfveps,"Regularly venting to someone definitely can be overwhelming and traumatic for the other person, I agree. I was more talking about when a loved one has a depressive episode and their negative thoughts took over and basically what they would do was cry for help to someone they trust on that moment of crisis. 

I think it depends on the individual who does the regular venting, I knew someone who was doing this but had no intention of improving their mental health, although it's very difficult to know exactly if they're doing it maliciously (which is a form of abuse/emotional manipulation) or they genuinely have manic/depressive episodes (bipolar people for example can appear outlandish when manic). Mental illness is not really black and white and I think it all comes to how much you know the person and their disorder, but my point mostly is that if they display toxic traits time to time due to their condition, I do believe they need to be heard out and decide what's the best thing can be done to make things better.

A therapist definitely should be involved in cases like these but sadly not everyone has access. My friend was put in a 2 month waiting list while she wanted to speak with a professional asap but since she wasn't actively suicidal, they didn't deemed it urgent enough. Therapy is great and I would recommend anyone doing it, especially if the therapist is very knowledgeable in your disorder.",2
Anxiety,n6ze4c,gxgmnyv,"I don’t disagree with what you just said. I read something somewhere that suggested when you need to emotionally dump, it’s a good idea to ask the friend, “Hey, I need to vent to someone, do you feel up to hearing me?”

I think getting consent is pretty important. If the listener is dealing with too much of their own stuff or just isn’t in a place emotionally to be able to handle someone else’s emotional dumping, then it can feel pretty violating.

I’ve taken that to heart and have noticed that my best friend is such a good listener and is so agreeable that she’s the person I tend to go to when I need to vent.

Is that fair to her? Not if that’s all I ever do with her, and not if I don’t check in with her first. If I’m a good friend, I’m going to care about her emotional well-being, too.

So I ask for consent before I vent, and I also intentionally make sure I’m available for her when she’s going through crisis. I also intentionally make sure that we have time together that is purely uplifting. That way, I don’t inadvertently just use her as my trauma trash can.

I think there are some folks out there who feel entitled to use a favorite person as a trauma trash can and feel victimized if the friend puts up boundaries for their own mental well-being.",3

Anxiety,1kb9zi1,mqoua3f,"My panic disorder began with a series of severe rolling panic attacks that lasted 2 weeks straight. It took a HUGE toll on my body and nervous system, and I have had severe daily psychosomatic symptoms every day since. When this began, I could barely eat or sleep, I went to the ER several times, was given emergency meds that didn't stop it, and eventually I begged my family to take me back to the ER so I could be institutionalized. 


It was all new, and my family had never dealt with something like this before. My mom and partner have dealt with mental illness in their lives, but my dad had not. He just couldn't wrap his head around the idea that anxiety could actually cause physical symptoms. 


He very heavily implied that it was all in my head and I was imagining my symptoms. I was never making it up, and was in a state of severe distress and was trying to get help. He struggled to believe me until he was told during a few of my doctors visits that everything I have going on is very much really happening in my body.


It is far from the worst thing I could have been told, but it's stuck with me since. I have it ingrained in my nervous system that I can be having an emergency and have the people around me tell me I'm exaggerating or I'm imagining it. I can be in such a state of distress and I can be looked at like ""great, she's at it again."" I have a difficult time talking about my anxiety despite it being such a dominant force in my life because I just assume that nobody will understand.",1

Anxiety,dry3el,f6mcung,"Hey, i know from experience (speech class) that it can be nerve racking speaking in front of that many people. Go in with a positive attitude and practice the speech as much as you feel comfortable with.

Anxiety,dry3el,f6ny8mj,"You got this! If you really know the subject matter and have a ton of experience, it will be easier than you think. The first time I taught a college class. I thought I’d draw a blank and not know what to say. Turns out, they knew nothing and I knew a ton, and could talk for ages. Sounds like you have first hand experience for your talk and that means you will have plenty to say. Make an outline for what you want to say, and anecdotes to go along with the bullet points.   If there is a question session after and no one is asking questions, have some questions of your own written down that you can ask individuals, it will help generate some discussion. Like make eye contact with someone and say “how about you in the purple shirt... was there a time you felt anxious and wasn’t sure what to do?” I’m just making up an example.",2

Anxiety,dry3el,f6o61ah,Your amazing! Thank you for helping remove and shed light on the negative stigmas around mental health.,2
Anxiety,dry3el,f6o6txh,"Hey man, as a professional public speaker...


This is gonna be some easy stuff. Because you're not talking about ancient Rome, or persuasive use of pathos, or eye diseases common to Labradors.

You're talking about shit you are intimately familiar with. You're a subject matter expert. 

And, unlike if you were a subject matter expert in Labrador Retriever cataracts, you KNOW the material intimately because you've experienced it.

You got this. It's not public speaking so much as it's talking to 1) at least one person in the room who's struggling but can't or won't talk about it yet, I fucking GUARANTEE IT, and 2) a LOT of other people who are trying to help those still struggling.


What you have to say, however nervous, however halting, is 100% going to better the life of one or more of their clients...and one or more of the people tuning in tomorrow. 

I've had people contact me 5 years later to say just that. 

You got this. The fact that you even find yourself in this position means you have a lot to offer. I bet it won't be the last time.

Good luck.",2
Anxiety,dry3el,f6ojk5s,🙏,2
Anxiety,dry3el,f6opcwo,True. Unless I'm completely breaking down I won't show anything except being quieter than usual (and I'm already a quiet person). There are subtler tells when I'm anxious but nothing that people would catch if they didn't already know.,3
Anxiety,dry3el,f6mnnuq,"but not actually tho,  break a leg meaning the saying in which you actually mean, “I hope you do good” rather than “actually break your leg” because we are not terrible people.

Anxiety,dry3el,f6pnagu,"I'm the same about not talking but don't I zone out. I'm entirely aware of everything but find it difficult to actually do things like bring myself to speak. It just sucks that it's hard for people to notice unless they know what to watch out for, and I always feel weird trying to explain things to people.",1
Anxiety,dry3el,f6mqnwn,"no, i am my own person",1
Anxiety,dry3el,f6pqaar,"Yea. And it’s not like I completely zone out. I’m aware of what’s going on 95% in my head and 5% to the rest of the world. It’s just hard and weird to explain, like you said",1

i try to be coot",3
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr65f55,I’m in a really weird place right now where my anxiety is actually better than it’s been in years because I don’t have the stressors in my life that I usually do. It’s weird to be in a place of feeling pretty good when most of my peer have never felt worse mentally,140
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr65cde,"I constantly have “crash days” where something seemingly small just causes my anxiety to crack and I have a breakdown. And then I feel guilty because I know other people, friends and coworkers included, are going through way harder times and dealing with worse shit. It’s a vicious cycle. I keep trying to take breaks to reset but it’s hard when you can’t go anywhere or actually step away when needed.",66
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr66j1a,"I never had any kind of anxiety before this lockdown.  I had what i would consider a pretty bad anxiety attack over the weekend a couple weeks back.

So to the people who deal with this every day holy shit you have my full support now because fuck anxiety.",28
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr64bgz,"I’ve always had some level of anxiety pre covid. Some days I feel like I can connect with others online in terms of how we are feeling and other days thing just don’t feel real at all - and causes me to disconnect to what’s going on around me

Almost like my anxiety has reached a boiling point and automatically causes me to dissociate and space out",23
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr67f3z,"I relate to this super hard! I haven't seen any friends for a few months and only talking to them through text I feel like I'm misreading everything they say and don't say. Some of my friends are barely responding to me when I try to reach out to them, and I can't tell if it's because they don't have the energy to talk or if it's because they just don't want to talk to me personally. So I can't tell if I should reach out more or less. And when I get asked how I'm doing I don't feel like I can be honest because I don't want to bum anyone out and because I don't feel like I have the right to complain. Also because I feel lonelier and more alienated from people every day the longer I don't see anyone and don't even see the point of trying to articulate how confused, sad and scared this whole thing is making me because I don't know how to put it into words, and the people who do ask me make me feel like I'm overreacting when I try to tell them anyways. Pretty crappy year to try to overcome anxiety, other mental health issues and work on having better relationships. I even feel whiny typing this out here but yeah, you're not alone :p",16
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr647st,"Honestly at first it helped my anxiety a lot just knowing that the whole world had no idea what was going on day to day... it was like ""finally, everyone feels how I feel every single day"".

Now is different though. I am an essential employee so I have been working while my husband is home with the kids. That is stressing me and triggering a lot of anxiety.",13
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr69s9v,People who are getting dressed and working out consistently WHO R U,9
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr670bp,"Yes, because there’s a difference between having anxiety from covid and having it worsen problems you already had",5
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr67rmt,Yeah I totally know how you’re feeling! I go from really okay days to really bad days. I overthink everything! It got to the point where I almost called my boss in tears because I thought he was personally attacking me for something when he likely was not. It’s really difficult when you don’t have that daily face-to-face time where you can better gauge what people are doing. I pride myself on quickly being able to read a situation in person but when I can’t see or talk to anyone it makes my brain explode lol sorry that you’re feeling super anxious! I’m with you! I would just say that a lot of it is probably not real and everything is ok.,5
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr68dhh,I think a lot of us feel like this to begin with. So this is severely exasperating that feeling of “am I that terrible?” And “am I being annoying?”. It’s very hard.,4
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr66y28,"Yes, not to mention the fact that I had a bad breakup during COVID and had to travel solo back to my home country. Feel like I'm on planet Mars.",4

Anxiety,gms6fi,fr68miq,My substance use has skyrocketed .,3
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr6k72s,"same, i have just accepted that people wont reciprocate the way i do, so i really just dont message any of them or rarely message any of my friends, i just wait til they come to me, if they dont see value in me then i might as well  not try so hard to be ""a good friend""  (what i perceive as a good friend, at least).",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr783hu,"Yeah, I think this time is kinda crazy for everyone. I have days where I’m good, and I’m totally understanding of everyone’s issues. Then, I have days where I’m not ok, and I’m crashing. It goes in waves. I know a lot of people are also riding this wave and struggling with how to deal with the ups and downs of anxiety right now. Especially being an essential worker or even constantly at home, those are easy triggers for anxiety.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7ani1,"I'm in the same place, honestly. You're not alone.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7ap4r,"Many people, myself included, do not like to ""meet"" virtually. I don't even like phone calls. Some people's anxiety over phone calls is insurmountable. I can do then a bit but prefer not to. I will not do video anything except as required by work. They may even get anxiety over texts. I do. Keep that in mind when people aren't responding. It's almost certainly not you. And that's before we even get to their depression/anxiety/mental issues.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7ersv,"I was actually doing better and then covid fucked that up. I went back to school this semester and was getting my life back together. Now I’m downing in anxiety with no job and no school, and there is no end in sight",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7k97k,"I can't speak for anyone but myself. But I haven't  really felt like reaching out to many people. I feel bad about it, and I make an effort, at times... but I really don't feel like doing much. I was anxious before covid, now it's laced with depression.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr8en16,"I had some depression and anxiety before this, but was still functional. In lockdown it has turned into not-eating, not-sleeping, crying for hours, panic attacks at work. And apparently everyone is feeling it, but I look around and I dont see it.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr6xksk,"Yeah for sure. The difference is that we are clinically anxious, depressed, etc. Everyone else may be worried or sad or have some level of angst, but it’s not clinical in nature.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr72bn8,"If anything, I'm secretly happy that they're suffering.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr72bvs,"I find it really hard to deal with ""newly depressed/anxious"" people as a veteran depressed and anxious person. 

Some days you want to spread encouragements and support and some days I just can't. I don't know why exactly, but one thing is that it's hard to feel compassion for those people when they were just not understanding at all when you were going through your thing",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7arb2,I feel even more invalidated and I feel like I have no place to speak about my depression and anxiety because when I do I’m told “omg Same” by peers who have never struggled with these things pre-COVID. It’s all just so weird.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7bt7b,"I feel better.... probably because I am an introvert and prefer being home. My therapist asked how I am handling things several times and I can say it does feel a bit weird to say ""great"". Maybe I'm just weird though.

Edit: I usually read the post and if it's something I prob want to reply to, I do, and then read the comments. I feel SOOOO much better knowing I am not the only one who feels this way!! 😁",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7dati,I hope so. It does take time. It’s so nice knowing I am not alone in this.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7oj1j,"I can relate to that in a way. I may be taking a more unhealthy approach than you though. I have come to realize that this ""new normal"" people are talking about, is my regular normal, and it honestly hurts me emotionally. I have honestly been given more stressors, because now I am not working, homeschooling my child, I am the only female in the house, also, my part time job is out of work, originally because no one wanted to come to Seattle, now it just continues that way, so I'm furloughed. And the list goes on and on. Now I am seeing things about how everyone has anxiety now, and I just can't help but to say, wow.. now suddenly everyone knows what it feels like. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Because it doesn't.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7pvm0,My fiancee dumped me right when all this happened every day is a struggle for me. I feel cold and void.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7qij2,"Strange times for us no doubt. Without everything that usually stresses me out such as school, I feel less anxious and physically better. On the other hand, my level of motivation couldn't be lower and the downward trend of my school grades continues.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7qs33,Sort of? I’m in that weird period where my pills are finally working and I’ve noticed I feel a lot less stressed/depressed than my friends and family. It’s been hitting my friends pretty hard. Personal matters have arisen and I try to help with their emotions because I’ve been through the cycles.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr92w0y,"Yh. I really struggle maintaining friendships. Especially in the past couple of years. Because I’ve always been the one who suffered in silence and was a barrel of laughs in person. 

When I couldn’t maintain the facade anymore, people got freaked out by it. I feel like people feel annoyed by me. People continue to react to my humorous Facebook posts, but the serious ones get ignored because they make people feel awkward. I get that. Like. I don’t want to be all “woe is me”. I’d have probably rolled my eyes at myself before I became myself. But here we are and it sucks

I have one friend who checks in daily without fail and genuinely cares. In a way he keeps me going because the thought of him blaming or second guessing himself for the rest of his life if I ended things is inconceivable. He loves life and he deserves to.

I have another friend who tries to reach out regularly despite me blanking his messages etc. He never takes it personally. He’s good people. One day I’ll make sure he knows he’s appreciated. 

But human interaction generally is hard and with the limited energy I have. I can’t do it",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr9hayf,"What is weird for me is that I was originally doing pretty well.  I also felt like, having anxiety my whole life has prepared me for staying home.  Then about 2-3 weeks ago, I woke up just full-on anxious.  My mind did that thing where it just swirls and goes through all these scenarios.  I started freaking out over every little thing my body did that might be different than usual.  I was short of breath, I started to freak out more.  And I have not been able to shake this since that morning I woke up.  Everyday since has been a mental battle and now physical because my body is feeling the tension.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fs5teyz,I am glad to hear it. I am doing better as well and am back at work.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr6hwap,"I feel very much the same. On the upside it’s allowed me to do the things I enjoy, hobbies and the like, as well as try some new things. I try to recognize that I am allowed to enjoy these reduced pressures, and hopefully keep this mindset going past the end of this craziness.",34
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr72e0f,"Dude, me too. This shit is like a walk in the park compared to most of my life.",10
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr71l07,"Yeah.  All though there are still some things that worsen my anxiety at times, I don't have all of the daily stressors I had before, and it's great.",9
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr741y3,"I can really relate to this. A lot of my friends are doing pretty poorly, as they never had to develop the coping skills needed to deal with extended stress, anxiety, etc.

I did struggle a bit with agoraphobia though, and that's starting to kind of creep back in because I'm just home all the time and it feels safe and I'm starting to worry about going out anymore and what it'll be like once I have to again.

Oh well, we'll see I guess.",8
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr80cug,"I'm doing pretty well too, and I still go to work every day so that hasn't changed for me. I had a phone psych appointment a month ago, and my doctor said that most of his patients were doing surprisingly well with all of this. He said he thinks we kind of had the advantage of being used to living with anxiety so this wasn't as big of a change as it has been for a lot of others.",3
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7ic02,"That was so me too! I was never more content with my place than I was when in lockdown with my kids. Back to work and I'm losing my shot again... Lol wtf brain!?

Other friends of mine who suffer from anxiety/depression were not coping however. Many nights were filled with covid related dreams.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr8wyv3,"Same. With everyone pretty much keeping distance, it has helped tremendously with my social anxiety, which in turn helps my overall anxiety, and gives me a better feeling almost daily.",1

Anxiety,gms6fi,fr69hmh,"I’m so sorry the people you have been sharing with treated you like you were overreacting. I think I had a similar experience this week when I tried to share my sadness about some news I got. I told several people, and some of them never even responded and the ones who did were dismissive. It’s such a crappy feeling when 1) it’s hard to open up in the first place and 2) you’re already questioning whether you have a right to complain when people all over the world are dying. I may not know your specific situation, but I just want to say that you have a right to feel however you feel. Even if it isn’t the absolute worst thing in the world, a bad situation still sucks. You still deserve to be listened to and taken seriously. If other people don’t get that, you can at least give yourself that respect. I hope things get better for you (and all of us) soon.",9
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr6hcqz,"I understand you. You’re not being whiny. <3 I’m sorry that some people are making you feel worse when you try to articulate how you’re really feeling. I was just talking with a friend about texting people and trying to connect - we both agreed that it’s kind of awkward because if you’re staying home, things are pretty much staying the same. So there’s not as much to talk about. Also everyone is going through their own stuff and might not have the energy to respond like you said. I would keep trying to be honest about your feelings though and keep reaching out instead of isolating. Maybe try scheduling a phone call with a friend rather than texting. It’s so nice to hear a friendly voice!",3
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr73zfq,I didn't know how to put my thoughts and feelings into words but you totally spoke my mind  on how I am feeling right now! Its a huge struggle navigating social situations right now since there are no indicators other then their words and its causing a lot of stress...,2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7lc9c,I feel that 100%.  This was a shitty year to start getting my shit together.,2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr6ipgn,Going back triggered my anxiety so bad I had to go on new meds. I also had to take leave. Now I feel guilty because I had to take leave. My boss is under so much pressure.

Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7veft,"Me here =) Exercises and established routine are surprisingly good at handling anxiety, for me at least - sure, I feel myself as insecure shit at times, but at least I always have a goal and some degree of control over my life, which is stuff I can cling to at worst of times.",3
Anxiety,gms6fi,frbi7ab,It’s just the only thing I have left.,1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7wrpg,"As someone who often ends up both on giving and receiving end of that: it's less about rudeness/condescension and more about, well, simply having closer connections and interests with some people. I do value all my friends to some extent, but there are ones that made a huge impact of my life or just have a lot of interesting things to discuss with me, so naturally when I barely have 1 hour a day to chat with someone, I'll prioritize them in particular. In simple words, it has less to do with you sucking or whatever else (I bet that you're a cool folk!), and more to do with different people clicking together in different ways. 

I guess in a way, it's kinda like love - you can't force it on someone with kindness/niceness, but if you have a decent personality, there are people who will already love you as it is. Similar with friendships, where best course of action is not to obsess over people who don't connect with you much, but remain decent and outgoing enough to get sucked into social circle by inertia.",2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7ov5v,"I feel this way too. I have friends who try to FaceTime out of the blue and I just ignore it because I just don’t have the energy to talk. I had one friend call me out and I just didn’t know how to respond so we haven’t talked since. She was kind of giving me anxiety, yelling at me when I wouldn’t respond even before covid.

Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7cfbi,"I wonder if I have some level of agoraphobia based on how being home has made me feel.  I think I was always on edge worried about how I was perceived.  At home, I can chill in what makes me comfortable and not feel so self conscious.",2

Anxiety,gms6fi,fr75a1z,"I’m also dealing with the exact same thing. I started a higher dose of Wellbutrin on May 8th, and had to go to work May 11th. I had an anxiety attack in the car ride to work. I ended up taking this week off to hopefully let the meds work.",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr7p4o1,"I've hated the phone and facetime forever - other than with my SO. I truly believe that I'm not a good friend either, and I feel guilt about it at times, but I also don't mind being alone because it can be so draining being in friendships. I had one friend that wanted to call me every day on our way home from work and I tried to explain I'm just not a phone person but she would say ""oh I'm always reaching out to you and it isn't reciprocated, you're a bad friend"" etc and I just kind of accepted that. I get lonely sometimes and I want to be invited places sometimes but in general I just don't make the effort and I can't blame them for not reaching out to me when I don't do it either",1
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr79dfh,I know exactly how you feel. My doc added abilify to my meds. I am doing well so far but I feel very groggy in the morning. They adjusted the dose today and I am hoping that does the trick and I can return in a week. Customers were acting crazy when we opened. No masks demanding as ever and our  full staff wasn’t back. I was working alone for the last 2 hours of the day. My anxiety was so bad I could barely drive home. I almost hit a car during a panic attack driving home from work last Monday. That’s when I knew it was time. I hope your meds work and we both can get back to work.,2
Anxiety,gms6fi,fr8iz1s,I find friendships draining too and I think that’s why I have never built any strong friendships with people. The friends that I lose are the types who get energy from friendships and they always want to talk and go out and they just drain my energy completely. I guess that’s just being an introvert but sometimes I have the ability to be an extrovert but I end up regret anything I did that seemed attention seeking.,1

Anxiety,1mke1dd,n7it1sn,"Yep. 

I know all social media, even Reddit, is horrific for my multiple mental health disorders, but whenever I delete the apps from my phone, I feel isolated.

Anxiety,1mke1dd,n7kekca,"i deleted my old 200k+ karma reddit account a couple years ago because reddit basically put me in the psych ward. i forgot what real people were actually like. some people are so brave behind a screen, so bold to say the most insensitive and vile shit one could possibly fathom.

it was partially on me too, though. i put myself in toxic spaces, drama subreddits and whatnot. certain subreddits (that i will not name in order to prevent anyone going down the same rabbithole i did) gave me a crippling fear of being recorded in public and ultimately rendered me unable to leave the house.

when i came back to reddit, i joined hobby subs, and cute and supportive subs about puppies and rainbows, and im new to the anxiety subreddit, but everyone has been so kind and empathetic, so truly human. my experience with reddit has been astronomically better this time around.

ill probably never touch facebook again aside from posting every 6 months to let my family know im still alive. i see more AI slop on facebook than i do on all other SM platforms combined. i just think its important to use SM for the right reasons- its a tool, not a lifestyle. kind of like how you cant replace food with vitamins and supplements, you cant replace real social interaction with social media.",1
Anxiety,1mke1dd,n7keuta,"It is, but social media is huge, we cannot control it the way we want to. However, i do believe we can use it the way we want to. For me fb, insta are a waste of time. On Twitter people are always fighting.  I mainly use tiktok and reddit. TikTok is for funny videos and relatable content.  For Reddit, I only follow and participate in subs that contribute to my life or add value. I also keep away from debates because it can get heated and unnecessary. I think keeping a strict feed helps a lot.",1
Anxiety,1mke1dd,n8euf4u,"Facebook and other social media are filled with all sorts of random stuff, sometimes even rage-bait. If you’ve got friends who like sharing political posts or constant news updates, it can really mess with your mental health. That’s why I made a separate Facebook account with zero friends, just so I can focus on the topics I’m actually interested in. It’s not perfect, but at least I’m not getting anxious from scrolling through toxic posts and shared news from people I know. I don’t visit Facebook as often as I used to, but it’s still handy for checking Marketplace, company promos, and events that still rely on the platform.

For me, Reddit works way better. I only see posts from the communities I follow, instead of random junk like on Facebook and other platforms.",1

Anxiety,1hyayfs,m6g3oiw,"I'm very happy you are seeking out help (not being forced). I have anxiety but it's manageable with meds and exercises (cardio, breathing, anything that gets me moving). My mother however, has spent her whole life giving into her control issues and anxieties. No meds (unfortunately she has NPD - yes, diagnosed by MD's, and bi-polar which basically stops her from taking meds because ""she's fine, everyone else is not fine""). I've had strained relationship with her my whole life (that anxiety can lead to abuse). Have a life time of eggshells to walk on. Heck I could pave  city streets with them.

But it doesn't stop me from feeling bad for her. She winds herself up so tight that she is much more vulnerable to scammers, those with cruel intent, etc. etc. She has been miserable for most of her life, alienated pretty much everyone and clings to her paranoia like it's gospel. But more than anything, she clings to her refusal to get help.

Contrast - a friend of hers has anxiety and bi-polar but got help. She has a lot more tools at the ready. She has learned to let go, live and let live (all the cliches), but believe me, she has to use those tools often to do so. She said those tools are like a workout for your brain - use it or lose it.

So my point is, the right help can be invaluable to you. I wish you the best and if this go doesn't help, keep looking for ways (another clinic/doctor) to make your life less stressed and anxiety filled.",4

Once I grew up and ""caught myself"" then understood that I was falling into similar patterns, playing the martyr/victim at the slightest criticism, I started taking the steps to change. Lots of good therapy and Al-Anon helped me (my brother coped by drinking). I started deliberately choosing sane and thoughtful role models.

I recognize that deterrence can be detrimental but abuse situations are extraordinarily common here and people frequently overlook them because of a mindless trust in authority.

Anxiety,1mlfb4j,n7q8mxe,"Believe me the symptoms of anxiety can be very physical. There might even be a physical cause, but not necessarily cardiovascular. Thyroid, blood sugar, hormonal imbalances, etcetera can cause such symptoms, but what if you've been to the doctors and had them all checked out? You can still have physical symptoms. First make sure you're covering the basics, like a healthful diet and exercise. If your anxiety is triggered by circumstances or thoughts, therapy should be next on your list. If you're still having symptoms, medications may be called for. But regardless don't lose hope; you can get help and get better.",2
Anxiety,1mlfb4j,n7qgwdv,"The physical symptoms can be really tough. It leaves me unable to function when it's bad. My advice, if you haven't consulted a doctor yet, would be to see if they could prescribe you something mild for sleeping. Even a .5mg or 1mg (fairly small doses) of Klonopin for a few weeks would probably do wonders for your sleep. But be very careful with taking any benzos for too long, as Im sure you know. For me, when I'm feeling like you are, sleep becomes the focal point. If you're not getting some decent rest the symptoms can start spiraling. 


Edit: I saw below you're not metabolizing some medications. Have you ever talked with your doctor about benzodiazapines (sp)? They can have some side effects, but at lower doses can be safe and very effective.


I've been on a few different SSRIs over the years with favorable to mixed results. I have never had a medication pull me out of a doom spiral like a two month prescription of Klonopin.",2

My body absolutely refuses to metabolize any form of medication to treat psychosis, emotional issues or stuff for insomnia.


Originally, I wast bothered because every medicine I've been on years prior sent me spiraling into more mental/emotional chaos.


Now I feel hopeless and feel like i was born at a disadvantage and it also adds to the overwhelming feeling j feel a lot.


(Sorry to bring this up randomly I just can't believe that this is genuinely my fate and I can't help but talk about it.)

I've been trying to to into therapy again since  haven't been in therapy for YEARS but I worry it won't help me.

I've been battling suicidal thoughts lately so I can at least understand that this is also another issue. I just keep putting it off and I genuinely don't know why. Last time I tried to get into therapy they sent me an email saying they wouldnt accept me since they didn't know how to help me. And my genetics don't allow for me to metabolize basically any medications to treat emotional/psychological health. I di visit a doctor to see what was going on and we did a gense site test and that's how I found out but I kinda already knew beforehand. Every other medication I took either gave me more issues or almost killed me lol...that doesn't mean that I can't try therapy again of course I think I'm just terrified of commitment because I worry that nothing will ever go the way I need it to. 


Thanks again for your advice and support. It means so much to me. I appreciate it very much and im very thankful.",1
Anxiety,1mlfb4j,n7qsaqj,"Thanks for the comment! I'm sorry that you relate to this anxiety really truly just sucks.


And my doctor showed me my results the majority was all in either yellow or red she did mention that taking a low dosage of something in the yellow could maybe work possibly. I can't remember what any of the names of any of the meds but I'll try and mention the benzodiazapine and see what I can do.


I have found that sometimes edibles do the trick in helping me fall asleep...but it's a gamble at times. It either knocks me out cold or makes sleeping a harder task. So I can't fully rely on it too much but maybe dosages should be taken into consideration too before I try and sleep. Not saying I vouch for or support this method obviously, I primarily just take them because it does help me with my mental and emotional issues.

Anxiety,1mlfb4j,n7rsfcv,"Thank you, for the reply! Edibles can be great and can really take the edge off, but as you mentioned, somewhat unpredictable.


 If your doctor thinks a low dose of a benzodiazopine is something that could help, I know it got me through a very rough period. Currently I'm on a fairly low dose of zoloft and have a prescription of .5mg of klonopin to take when needed.

Anxiety,1mxmhhp,na5znji,"It does make sense. I can only imagine how difficult this is and how awful you must be feeling right now. But things will change and we must convince ourselves if we can’t believe it. You are not defined by your current situation or anxieties and it’s important to remember that, you’re more than what you are dealing with therefore things will change. I can’t tell you that your bfs parents are going to be nicer but I can tell you that your boyfriend can make his own decisions. And if all the catastrophizing you are going through happens, big IF, then you will survive and you will still be the person who’s gone through a lot and survived in the past. I don’t have much advice as this sounds like a situation that just has to pass, but please be kind to yourself and don’t let those bad voices win. always love yourself. For the anxiety it’s important that you take personal time away from this so you can breathe, whether in your hobbies, a walk, or even a bath. As long as you have alone time to process and decompress. Best wishes and stay strong.",3
Anxiety,1mxmhhp,na60649,"Your worth doesn’t come from the opinions of other people. I know it’s easier said than done, but try to remember that regardless of what happens with your boyfriend or his parents, you have worth. You can get back to where you were and you can even see higher levels of satisfaction. Just try to focus on yourself and what will make you happy, without paying too much mind to what others want from you. 

If you feel like cleaning up will give you a win, then try to clean a bit. Even if you can’t tackle everything, life is incremental. It’s okay to pause.",3
Anxiety,1mxmhhp,na6tb4p,"Last week, I wrote my last message to my therapist because I was going to end it all. Something really triggering happened to me, leading to very vivid ptsd flashbacks to a really scary time in my life. Everything seemed so big and scary and permanent. I knew I had so much to live for but I just didn't think that I could make it another day. 

I didn't end up sending the note. I called a crisis line instead. The person on the other end didn't fix things for me but she said to hold on and just try to do one thing to feel better every day, even if that one little thing is drinking a sip of water. So I held on over the weekend. I called my therapist on Monday and told her that I had written her a note and that it was sitting in my drafts. We made a safety plan and I held on some more. It's been 4 days since then. Things got better. I'm laughing again. My problems are not gone but my emotions about them aren't so big anymore. And I keep thinking back to something my therapist said to me: ""Don't shame yourself for the way the younger version of you is trying to protect you when things get hard."" I think that may be what's going on with you - maybe there's a younger version of you trying to protect you in the best way it knows how - with crying, tensing the body, etc. 

I don't know if any of what I'm saying will be helpful to you. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though things feel so impossible, so big and so permanent in the moment, it won't feel that way forever. Whatever reactions your body is having right now - crying, anxiety, spiraling, etc. - that's all totally valid and totally okay. Heck, I was crying for days in my bed last week that there was mold growing on my dishes. I'm not proud to admit that, but it was what my body needed to do to move through an incredibly challenging moment. So do what you need to do to get through this - maybe a brain dump on a piece of paper and then ripping it to pieces, go into an empty field and scream, whatever it is. All of it is valid and okay.

The bullshit office I’ve been at for 2 months (that isn’t treating me for what I have and won’t return calls or emails) paid no regard to my actual diagnosis but the doc at UC put me back on the meds I was on for a year and a half before the insurance fuckery went down and I ended up at the shit place.

You're not doing anything wrong by seeking inpatient psychiatric care.

 If the reason you're saying it's unethical is because you're suggesting an unalive attempt or taking some other dramatic action in order to get admitted - there is no need for any of that.  If you go to the emergency room and tell them that you're having trouble and don't feel safe waiting all that time, and explain that you feel you need inpatient care, they will get you placed in inpatient care, it's as simple as that.

I also don't know what you mean by ""forget about it if you're American.""  We have tons of wonderful inpatient psych facilities in the states, and they address everything you need to ensure you receive the best treatment going forward.

Anxiety,1fx2dpu,lqlpp55,"Also, before I had insurance (I have medicaid now, so everything is covered - halle-fucking-lujah), I was never denied treatment for unpaid medical bills.  I feel like medical care accessibility in the US gets a worse rep than it actually deserves.  I had no money and no insurance, and I was always sick, whether it was mental or physical (I have chronic illnesses on top of psychological disorders), so my medical bills just piled up and went into collections.  I had trouble with being able to get private doctors appointments, but the hospital never, ever denied me treatment!  Even if I needed to be admitted for days, they still gave me the same quality of care as any other patient.  The hardest part of not having insurance was affording prescriptions, but we have a lot of companies, like goodRX, that give HUGE discounts on scripts, so that was always a lifesaver.  Even with no insurance, you can manage to access healthcare when it is necessary, they're not as mean as they're made out to be!

PS - my medical debt has all been forgiven, now! 🥲  That's another program we have in the US to compensate for not having free universal health care!  I literally got a call one day from a lady who asked me, ""Are you ever going to pay these medical bills?""  I was like ""Honestly ... probably not.  Why, am I in trouble?""  She said, ""Oh, no, sweetie - we were notified that you're on medicaid now, so we just needed confirmation that you're unable to pay your debt, so that we could go ahead and just forgive it.  You'll get a form in the mail, just go ahead and sign it and send it back and that debt will be gone!""  I was so happy, I would've been doing back flips if I had that kind of physical prowess!

""Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""",2

How we nourish our mind and body is so important when it comes to understanding how we will react to the world we operate in. 
I don’t think it’s about accepting that you can’t do this or that anymore. Rather, it’s that you’re realizing that you shouldn’t and that is more important. I feel like some are blessed with the function of anxiety to alert them when something isn’t right and needs changing; while others will continue to move through life with no warning of the harm they are putting themselves through.
Anxiety has taken so much away from my life within the past few years; but it has also blessed me with a new perspective and given me so much as well.
At first I believe we think anxiety is this monster lurking to steal, kill and destroy us but once you realize it’s the scared, innocent and worried child you begin to realize it needs love and compassion. Anxiety has taught me to love myself and appreciate my own wants and needs. Neglecting what we need is not healing and anxiety is just a child crying for help.

It turns out that the decades of failed depression and anxiety treatment was because those were only secondary symptoms to living with my actual neurologic disorder being misdiagnosed and untreated. 

I feel very strongly after this experience that our mental health treatment system (U.S.) is severely flawed. It attempts only to stop symptoms from happening and doesn't seem to make any attempt to find the real root of those symptoms. Depression and anxiety specifically are top symptoms for a majority of other mental health disorders when they aren't treated, so screenings that help determine what else might be causing generalized depression and anxiety should really be the place that we're starting.

I'll just add to that... while being diagnosed and on a medication that helps did pretty much eliminate the generalized depression and anxiety I was experiencing, it doesn't actually stop me from having ADHD or struggling with it. It wasn't a magic fix, and because I'm in the later half of my life it definitely doesn't make certain goals I might have had any easier to achieve. If I had been diagnosed in my twenties I might feel differently, and maybe having been diagnosed as a kid would have led to a drastic change in trajectory, but it's difficult now to unpack and change well established habits and coping mechanisms, and it doesn't change that my brain still won't fit a traditional schooling system very well. 

So while I do think there's value in continuing to look for solutions, I still feel that my mental health experience limits my true potential.

I was in the same boat... Made it to VP of an ad agency and my mental health was in shambles. Took a step back, did some self reflection on what realistic expectations and goals are for ME (instead of people pleasing others) then went after it. I still struggle here and there but I do daily affirmations every morning to set the tone and remind myself everyday on what I'm ok doing and not doing. It's been two years now and I feel like a completely different person now.

I tell myself that the pay cut I took was my ""peace of mind tax"" and it has been worth every penny.

Sounds like you had a similar journey, glad you did and hope you're finding a similar peace. Going through those struggles provide a good baseline when we start slipping into comparing ourselves to others and thinking we need to do ""more"" again. Nah we're good.",1

Before this I used to write and record ideas in like 3 hours (just sketches, but they would be a basis for full songs). Even when I used to go out partying 4 out 7 days a week, come home drunk and high, I'd be able to get music written and recorded. Go to bed for 3-4 hours then go to work, go out at night again, ad nauseam (literally). But now I'm on methadone and have anxiety and I can't complete anything. I can get pretty far writing ideas but then I tell myself ""I'll finish this tomorrow"" and then I just don't. I DO write ideas down in a journal when they do come.

I'd get a dx and change my plans to accommodate and try to still attain my dreams/plan, then repeat and repeat and repeat. I finally had to just change my dreams and mindset. 

Basically become less ableist to myself and others. It's okay to admit I can't do anything and everything just because I ""set my mind to it"" or back in the day ""pray hard enough"" to be able to do things. For example, I'm infertile, my old dream of giving birth to my very own baby is not a dream I will be able to achieve just because I put my mind to it or pray for it. I had to learn to be okay and be realistic without becoming a pessimist lol. 

So, my dreams just changed and I'm happier than I've ever been because I was able to change a lot of thought processes and patterns of behavior. Still got a ways to go but I'm in a much better mindset and just more happy in trying to be content than in trying to ""reach my full potential"" or ""purpose"".

Anxiety,1myt6ws,naeexem,"It can *definitely* be reversed. But take it gradually — don't rush into doing exercise or you risk (a) injury and (b) putting yourself off because it's hard :-)

Just try to build some simple activity into your day — walking to the shops every day (if that's realistic) provides a good ""goal"" for being active.  
  
Then, once you're happy with doing a certain level of exercise, maybe look into signing up to a fitness centre — preferably one with a swimming pool, as swimming is a great ""low impact"" exercise.  But don't sign up if you don't think you'll go — the ""guilt"" of not going can be quite demotivating, as can paying for something you're not using.

It’s a struggle for me. I’ve also done all the trial and errors with drugs and hated ssri’s. There is always a price to pay. It’s like you might not be anxious but you trade it for being a zombie or having sexual dysfunction. 

I’m currently on Wellbutrin which doesn’t have sexual side effects but doesn’t necessarily help with anxiety. It doesn’t make it worse but some say it does. 

Honestly, I’ve learned the less the better. Yes, we have a chemical imbalance but introducing all these things to your body really messes with your brain chemistry.

Anxiety,1lewg3s,myk5pjc,"I have PTSD, GAD, ARFID, and am recently in remission from BPD (i don't meet the diagnostic criteria anymore but I still experience symptoms from time to time). I had to drop out of school and have a super low-key job and was also hospitalized a few times because I just could not figure out how to manage my mental health. It's been 4 years since my last hospitalization and I'm back in school full-time and working as well. 

What I'll say is that finding my path to managing my mental health hasn't been easy and took me at least 3 years to fully figure out. It was a lot of trial and error and I'm still learning. Here is what works for me currently: 

\- Trintillex 20mg and Trazodone 100mg, Vitamin D, Seroquel 25mg PRN 

\- daily yoga, and music/art for safe emotional expression 

\- weekly therapy (sometimes more) and dietitian appointments every 3 weeks 

\- weighted blanket, heated blanket, noise-cancelling headphones, etc. for sensory needs and PTSD symptoms

What I've learned is that my go-to coping skills are always changing because my life is always changing. Sometimes I need more support and sometimes I need more alone time. Therapy has been a slow burn - I have a really good relationship with my therapist now only because I stuck with it and built it up over the past 5 years. I really appreciate the work we've both done together in the last few years because it makes the sessions now exactly what I need them to be. 

I feel like I've really found my ""rhythm"" for how to live with my mental illnesses and still thrive. I'm patient with myself and I recognize that life with mental illness is hard but that it doesn't have to be all-consuming. It was a LOT of work to get here - lots of frustration and lots of trial and error. Sometimes my usual coping tools stop working and I have to build up a new combination of skills that work. That's just part of the mental illness package and I deal with it by connecting with others who have similar experiences. It's hard but not impossible.",1

Anxiety,1m6kiju,n4kb9di,"Are you seeing a therapist at all? I think that would be a good start on navigating your triggers as well as finding the best way to be there for your friend even when you're struggling. 
That being said, I don't think it's a bad thing to set boundaries. I've found that honesty is the best policy with the TRUE friends. They may be upset at first but they will understand and not hold your mental health against you.

I saw something recently that said something like 12 mins talking to someone who cares about you can turn things around. My bestie and I both have depression and anxiety issues, nothing too severe but they can still make things difficult, so we like to ask each other ""do you have 12 mins?"" If we really can't handle the extra mental load that day, then we can say no and its no big deal. So maybe talk to your friend about something like that, where you can kind of ask for help in a way that doesn't make it feel obligatory and the other person will understand it has nothing to do with them.",1
Anxiety,1m6kiju,n4kdeq7,"I just started seeing a new therapist, yes! It's a bit tricky because I'm moving to another state soon (although temporarily) so I'll have to find someone else during that time. But you're right, it would be good to mention it to a therapist and see how I can navigate it better. 

That's a really great idea, I'd never heard of that! 12 minutes is a small period of time, but it would be a great way to have a boundary and still be able to help each other. Her issues are definitely of the more severe type, especially with the depression, but getting into a routine like that might help. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into that!",2
Anxiety,1m6kiju,n4l70s6,"If you like your current therapist, maybe see if they do virtual or telephone visits! I love my therapist, so would really hate having to find a new one myself! 

12 mins may not be enough some days, but I think it's a good starting point and a way to start implementing some boundaries! Maybe some days you can give 12 mins, maybe some days its zero, some days it could be as long as they need. Trial and error, I say :)",1

Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mi8ecya,"I!m sure you're not an excuse of a person. But I understand anxiety might make you afraid you are. If you got a new job and are in a new country, that's a big step out of your comfort zone, so it makes sense it's triggering. Anxiety hates all changes, even positive ones. At least for some time. 

Do you engage in lots of anxiety related behavior such as repeated checking, reassurance seeking, avoiding triggers or trying to distract yourself from feeling anxiety? I'm asking if you have been doing any of that on regular basis.",1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mi9c6tm,Yes I do 😳…. Constantly,1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mi9k10a,"Okay, so it makes sense then. Do you understand how anxiety works in terms of how it's from having low tolerance of uncertainty?",1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mierwr8,"A bit , I feel like forced to accept that life is uncertain but that doesn’t change anything or work for me. It just makes life not tolerable and I want to just not life at times",1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,miez1sb," I recently explained to someone how to address it, so I can just copy it here. Maybe you'll find it useful:

Anxiety is from having low tolerance of uncertainty. That causes small possibilities of something going wrong spiral into bigger worrying. And it then creates the need for reassurance. By engaging in reassurance, you further lower your tolerance of uncertainty, creating the need for more reassurance and causing anxiety if you don't do it, exactly like addiction. Besides reassurance seeking, avoiding triggers also lowers this tolerance. And even trying to rationalize it in your head is bad for it. The point is doing anything to ease your worrying about it is bad. It might make you feel better in the moment, but it makes the problem worse long term, like when an alcoholic has a drink.

The solution is to stop with all of this and instead just sit with the fear. The point is to become comfortable with uncertainty. And you achieve that by staying in uncertainty on purpose. So you need to identify your anxiety related behavior and then make effort not to engage in it. Some is usually very obvious. Some less so. You should go about everything as if this problem wasn't a factor.

And also use the radical acceptance technique. Meaning whenever you're worried how something bad might happen or something bad might be true, accept how it might indeed happen or indeed be true. And add how it's fine that way. Even if you don't believe that. In this kind of ""whatever"" tone in your head. And always end thinking about it on that note. Besides that just sit with it.",1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mif0r1q,So asking ppl online for advice is reassurance ? Telling myself I’m ok with everything going bad makes me just give up and depressed and not care at all . And just making everything worse because it’s going to be bad anyway . I get really extreme . But for me that’s just how i process things. I just find it hard to be inn the middle . It seems contradictory,1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mif40fs,"Yes, that is bad. It results in your brain soon bringing that worry up again for further reassurance. Resulting it in never stopping that way. 

And I don't mean you should give up exactly. It's more about feeling fine even if the bad things happen. Doing this leads to you eventually feeling a lot better and happier. But I understand it's scary.",1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,mif5bs7,I should clarify that asking to find out some new information or tips is fine. Reassurance is if you are asking repeatedly about the same thing. For example if you would have health anxiety and you ask if your symptom could mean something serious. And then you ask later again about the same thing. And possibly again and again with no end. That's a typical example of reassurance seeking behavior.,1
Anxiety,1jd8eo2,miluc8o,Ok thank you. But what if I just haven’t searched had enough in the end I will find something wrong and a solution for it? This happens to lot of people on Reddit … or like being misdiagnosed … or dismissed . It’s had to reconcile with this fear because I haven’t checked every single thing under the sun . Or tried every single modality yet until I find what works,1

But I'm wondering if I talk to him and I'm blunt if it will help but the easiest way I believe is to go to a new doc that's in the same practice that's closer  to my home ( we moved ) and is experienced with Panic disorders and Anxiety Disorders and Dspression.,1

Anxiety,1l5xjpl,mwnsich,"I don't really have much advice to offer, but only because it sounds like you're doing all the right things already.  

From my own experience of having mental health problems, just knowing that there is someone there who loves and cares for me (I'm incredibly lucky to have a really supportive partner) is really important.    
  
Bear in mind that your boyfriend may end up feeling guilty that you care so much — this is just yet another symptom of depression. Not overwhelming him may be a tricky balancing act, but it very much depends on how your boyfriend reacts to things.  E.g. when my partner tries to encourage me to do things, I tend to become defensive and irritable, which I know upsets her, which in turn fuels how guilty I feel. But I know she's only doing so for good reasons and I try my best to react 'constructively'.

I was going to suggest some online resources (e.g. [https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/programs/anxiety-disorders-program-adult/anxiety-educational-resources/patient-manuals](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/programs/anxiety-disorders-program-adult/anxiety-educational-resources/patient-manuals) ) but you've already had a great reply from ParkingPsychology over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l5xdzp/comment/mwl3ovh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l5xdzp/comment/mwl3ovh/)

Anxiety,1jfd5ro,miq276n,"While sinus inflammation itself doesn’t typically cause elevated D-dimer levels, sinus inflammation can be a factor in conditions, like cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that do lead to increased D-dimer, and a higher number of involved sinuses has been linked to higher D-dimer levels in CVST patients.",1

A lot of them are also designed for bladder leakage, and can hold up to 100 mL, which is quite a lot, especially for how unobtrusive they are (they straight up just feel like normal underwear). The safeguard has really quelled my brain's panic button about needing to pee. And I don't know if I'm surprised by this or not, but I pretty infrequently actually have to use them for any amount of urine at all. It's like my brain is OK with just peeing when I actually need to again.

I will say as a pro-tip though, the psychological effect didn't start working until I *let* myself pee in them just a little bit, just to let my brain even conceive of the fact that it wouldn't be a total unmitigated disaster.

If you ignore the symptoms or try and fight the symptoms (which only makes it bigger because you’re fighting a fight flight system and that’s creating a feedback loop), then the symptoms will continue to escalate. I’ve seen patients who have had epileptic type seizures for years because they did not understand the purpose of these symptoms and did not respond accordingly.

Researching symptoms and staying focussed on them is only going to increase them, but figuring out how not to fight them and how to respond to them appropriately will have them naturally back down.",4

 I felt like a different  person today.
 It feels like ive been let down by the medical community, since i had to figure this out for myself. And no one ever mentioned it could be an anemia thing, since guys Usually arent anemic. But even after quitting alcohol, the dark circles wouldnt go away. Slow healing factor. Brain fog.

Usually after social interactions I will have a headache for the rest of the day unless I’m comfortable and close with the person/people. Just wish I was able to afford meds. I was going to my local centers but they didn’t give me enough meds to last until my next appointment so I was in constant withdrawal but imagining myself being able to “control”this borderline crippling anxiety makes me feel like I would be unstoppable lmao,1

Then comes my gastrointestinal issue...gwashhhhhhh the way I used to have back pain chest pain from gas my goodness!!!! Even having a single proper meal was getting hard. 

Thankfully I started therapy few months back after fighting anxiety for 3 years and slowly but subly the gastrointestinal issues are getting better...of it won't vanish totally but atleast I can enjoy a proper biryani without the fear of throwing up or something....and the most important thing anxiety is not gone obv...it is still hankering and maybe it will always hanker after me but what's the main aim is to not completely nullify it but to learn ro deal with it effectively...sometimes I do neglect those....but hopefully it will be in my control cuz a mere anxiety should not be having my life in it's control.

Anxiety,1khjw49,muoyiu2,"Sorry for the delay in reply - deep inside I was nervous about discussing this. I pushed myself to write this this morning. Thank you so much on advance.  

I've had a few episodes that seem like postural hypotension. Most of the time it's brief - I stand up and feel lightheaded, dizzy, and a bit weak, but it passes within a minute once I sit or steady myself.

However, I’ve had two rare instances where the symptoms (lightheadedness, fatigue, slight unsteadiness) lasted for several hours. In both cases, I ended up going home and sleeping it off. My heart rate during those episodes was elevated but not extreme -  around 120 bpm while resting and would ride to 130-140 if I'd stand up. My heart rate is normally around 70-80 while resting and 95-110 while standing. 

Also, on rare occasions when I flop into bed quickly, I feel mild heart palpitations and have to sit up for a minute until it settles.

Not sure if that’s anxiety, a lingering effect from something cardiac, or just benign.

For context, I had myocarditis two years ago, but I’ve had annual checkups since then. In my annual  echocardiogram within the past year showed no issues.

Is there something I should be worried about needing to resolve medically? Is this a condition or just anxiety? Specifically those 2 episodes that lasted a few hours at such a heightened heart rate. 

I can answer any questions or provide clarification of course.",1

All good thankfully 🙏🏻 They just told me too follow up with PCP. I still have all the symptoms of course . Oh and I made them feel my spleen cause I swore it was enlarged. Nope. I still feel the symptoms of course, but I'm happy those results were good. Now onto my PCP . Probably more testing follow ups, hormone and thyroid tests also.

1. Go to the doctor and it checked out EKG, ultrasound, etc (there is likely absolutely nothing wrong with you, otherwise, TRUST ME, you'd know.


2. Exercise. And I don't mean lifting weights and barely breaking a sweat although it's perfectly fine to build up confidence by literally just moving.


Eventually, I want you to do some hyrox style exercises where you really ger your butt kicked and gasp for air.


You'll quickly realise there is nothing really wrong because with heart conditions, exercise (even going up the stairs) is going to be very very difficult.

Anxiety,1khjw49,mrugqjd,"My main symptoms are , body aches everywhere I’ll say pins and needles type of pain , fatigue , brain fog , muscle spasms , and pain when pressing on my abdomen , diarrhoea and constipation . Ive done multiple blood tests (unremarkable) , gastroscopy ( diagnosed with hitial hernia) , upper and lower abdominal  ultrasound (unremarkable) . Although I’m 99% sure that there is nothing wrong with me , I want to keep pushing for further testing , fucking anxiety man. I’ll keep you updated",3
Anxiety,1khjw49,mruhsrm,"Oh I forgot , I went to endocrinologist thyroid ultrasound (unremarkable) , 2 times at a cardiologist did heart triplex two times and ekg two times (unremarkable)  , and a chest xray(unremarkable) when I visited the ER which is kinda stupid because I told them that I had stomach aches and diarrhoea 😂, I hate my country …",2
Anxiety,1khjw49,msblos2,"Right? Like, why can't I just snap my fingers and turn off my anxiety? 😂😭 Most of the time I feel confident that I can work through this.

Anxiety,1khjw49,necbbcr,"I want you to believe your doctor. Even if they seem to brush things off, it's important to remember that they've seen 1000 people just like you before and can easily see and tell if there's something wrong (again - I doubt there is anything and even more so because you're 19).


Also - keeping your heart rate low makes no sense even if you do have a heart condition. :))


People with heart failure and such are also advised to exercise to strengthen their hearts.


Push yourself physically (ideally doing something you like) - considering it's your heart rate that spikes anxiety - that's the best way to prove your brain it's wrong.


If you have a close friend or family member, consider telling them about it and do something together.",1
Anxiety,1khjw49,mruk174,"I hear ya. This anxiety is taking over everything. Sounds like you got a pretty good workup but you know how much we doubt everything cause we really feel these symptoms and swear they have to be real. I also have the muscle aches everywhere, I go between diarrhea and constipation, mostly diarrhea, fatigue most definitely, and I have abdominal pain but on my left upper side. I told the ER that but they did nothing. I want to ask for an abdominal ct , and also like I mentioned thyroid tests cause it runs rampant in my family and hormone testing cause I'm at perimenopause age and my cycles are acting weird. All this on top of grief from losing my Dad recently, looking for full time work, and financial struggles. Like wtf I don't need this on top of everything.

Anxiety,1khjw49,msbm5vw,I feel that 😂,1
Anxiety,1khjw49,mrz5krn,"Hi.
Yeah I'm going through it. Physically, mentally, emotionally, all of it. I used to look in the mirror constantly I mean all the time. But I had to stop cold turkey. It was absolute torture. My big thing was checking my eyes and skin to see if I looked jaundice. Ugh . The loss of appetite could be hernia or it could absolutely be anxiety . When I was at my very worst at 20 years old I didn't eat anything and when I tried it was two spoonfuls of soap that I would vomit afterwards. I lost so much weight I looked horrible. My advice if it is anxiety related just make sure your drinking enough. Get water and Gatorade in you. And eat very small if you can. No need to rush into anything. Just stay hydrated and soup broth helps also.",1

Anxiety,1jlwhwe,mk73laz,"When my depression was really intense a few months ago I let my oral hygiene go and I felt like I developed a gross mouth. It just always felt dirty even when I did brush. I haven't dated in a while so it took me a while to notice honestly. After 5 years of being single and a lot of failed dates in the past, I do have a tiny itty bitty part of me that hopes to make out with another human being again some day so I decided to start taking it more seriously and I've been really happy that I did. Also the fear of expensive health problems was pretty motivating too. Brushing twice a day, using a tongue scraper twice a day, antiseptic mouthwash once a day, and flossing once a day. I feel a lot more confident now and at least it's one thing in my life I have control of 😅",3
Anxiety,1jlwhwe,mza4x1f,"I was just googling this and came across your post. I think this is a real possibility. There have been so many studies that when you have anxiety, you don't have good oral health. But I think the opposite is true as well. I suspect it has something to do with your gut biome, and how your gut biome is affected by the bacteria in your mouth. My anxiety results in a lot of stomach issues. So I started taking better care of my teeth and flossing daily and my anxiety has been greatly reduced!",1

I went to the doctor and the dentist multiple times and was reassured that everything is OK with me. 

It gets better I promise.",2
Anxiety,1j3ju8g,mg19me7,"me! i did! Stop smoking weed that shit is awful for manifesting and storing anxiety. (or at least take a long break)  
Keep up with the CBT, that helped me the most. I was having weekly bouts of anxiety and panic attacks thinking I had some insane medical emergency happening, usually always at night. On several occassions I thought I was going to die within minutes, yet here I am. 

  
If you can afford it, go to the doctors, get checked out. An opinion from a medical professional should defintley help ease concerns. DO NOT google symptoms or any other shit. Only listen to your doctor, not doctor google. There is nothing wrong with being focused about your health, but you have to be cautious and not turn the focus into unfounded worry. Also, start exercising. If you're already exercising, exercise more. Not only will the exercise ease your anxious state, but it will also improve your health and you'll be able to feel better about being healthy.",1
Anxiety,1j3ju8g,mg0wab3,Appreciate ur comment! It’s crazy how anxiety works,1
Anxiety,1j3ju8g,mg1aq2c,Yes getting checked out was the best thing I did for myself. So much relief! And I do keep on top with my health and exercise.

Anxiety,1ivd9r0,me501wx,"hey there, i first off want to say i’m so sorry you’re going through this. i’ve struggled with death, health anxiety, and existentialism my whole life as well and i wouldn’t wish it on anyone. i have a lot of the same thoughts you have, but mine are also a LOT of “what ifs” — (i.e. what if i’m dying and i don’t know, what if my husband suddenly dies, etc.). i’ve had anxiety disorder since i was about 4 years old (i’m now 27) and i’ve recently come to the realization that my anxiety disorder may actually be OCD. i need to be assessed of course, but it definitely lines up with most of what i experience. i’m also not saying that’s what you have either, but it might be worth looking into as well, especially if this has come on suddenly i’ve definitely read that can be common in early 20s, kind of suddenly coming up. i was also very academically gifted and have realized in my 20s that i’m neurodivergent, and that can be very common with anxiety and other disorders, not sure if you are also neurodivergent but again it can be common. sorry for the long reply, just wanted to share some insight and let you know you’re not alone in this. 

please know you’re not alone. i’m here if you ever need someone to talk to, my dm’s are open. and if you ever need, you can text 988 for support if you ever are in crisis. take care ♡",1

I also have severe health anxiety and I have horrible symptoms that doctors won't diagnose (I don't even ask for medicine and refuse it) but all the things lead to some sort of degenerative muscle or joint disease. Even runs in the family. But here I am 30 and lost with no help. No friends.  It's not a great feeling.",16

What helped me the most though was realizing that my health anxiety was actually all stemming from unprocessed trauma and repressed emotions. Like, en entire lifetime of never really emoting. Once I started being able to actually feel all the anger and sadness, my fear got a lot less crippling. A lot of time fear is just masking more uncomfortbale emotions like anger.",10

Even those that seem like they have it together, have their worries and falls as well. Try to be kind to yourself and appreciate what you have accomplished. Even though you’ve played a lot of games, not all of our time has to be productive. We won’t remember every millisecond of our life in crystal clear detail, the brain often deletes extra information.

Anxiety,1ccflxz,l1832so,"Just because your body ages doesn’t mean your soul has to!

I still mourn the time I’ve lost but looking at death in a different light instead of “oh god something else I can’t control” think “finally something I can guarantee is going to happen no matter the different outcomes” 

It doesn’t necessarily help with health anxiety sadly cause that’s a whole separate issue imo (at least for me it is)

It’s hard to balance proper health worry with over worrying, I almost lost my life recently bc I convinced myself all my symptoms were anxiety induced, I say that example to say that if you feel a physical symptom (that’s painful or reoccurring) and can afford the Dr, there’s no harm going to see if you’re alright. Yearly checkups are great for worrying about conditions because in most cases, if you have something terrible going on they’ll find it!",1

This week in particular has been the most terrifying and confusing week of my life… for so many anxiety-related reasons, like my body has hit a breaking point and cannot go on like this.

Dealing with menopause and the scary symptoms that come with it that I had no idea about brought on the dpdr.

But when I'm scared I always think that I'm seeing things or movement on the sides of my vision that aren't there or that I'm about to see something terrifying. being in dim lighting makes it worse because I've got astigmatism and poor night vision.

Anxiety,16thenk,lglu8a7,"Im 15 and I’ve been struggling with DP/DR for maybe 7 months now, I am constantly stressing myself out looking for answers or trying to get to the root of it because there seems to be so many options, I overdosed by accident in December while on top of that quitting nicotine and also (falsely) going on meds all within the same week, and had a bad trip on weed prior to that, I often question if maybe those events were the cause of this all, or it’s my environment at home, or all of it. Needless to say I’m tired of feeling nothing, and it’s kind of ironic because not that long ago so much was happening all at once I only wanted to feel nothing, and now id give next to anything to feel just normal again. Sometimes if I try hard enough Ill just *barely* feel again, I’ll try to bring myself back into reality by doing things that make me feel real, but it’s like no matter what I do inside of my mind I’m still trapped, I’m not always going to be trapped and because of this I learned that but it feels like that now. a big thing that keeps me trapped is this weird thing where my mind genuinely convinces me that because I said I *would* do something, I’ll just end up not doing it somehow. Not sure if that makes any sense but it’s a hard mindset to escape once you get into it, and being that way only makes my DP/DR worse because it’s like I subconsciously slip back into the deep end whenever I find myself scratching the surface.

Anxiety,16thenk,mrn3lw2,"I find myself coming back to this post every time I get anxious about my DP/DR. Knowing that i’m not alone and being reminded that this feeling is completely recoverable helps a lot when my head starts to spiral. 

For anyone reading this, I think it’s important to know that you’ll have ups and downs. The last few days I noticed myself thinking about my DP/DR less and less, until last night I caught myself deeply spiraling again. I just had an experience like this. After finishing a movie with my partner, I looked over at her and started thinking about unreal she looked and how my whole reality felt like it was in my own head. My anxiety spiked like crazy and I started to panic. Thankfully, the logical part of my brain knew this was all just because of my DP/DR while I was spiraling, and that’s what helped me get out of it. I stood up, turned on the lights, did some breathing, and changed the scenery by going upstairs. Everything still felt unreal but my anxious thoughts about it started to dissipate. I ended up falling asleep alright but still woke up today with anxious and bad feelings about it. It felt like I was back at square one. (which is probably why i’m here typing this). This is all part of recover from DP/DR, you’re not going to just have a linear regression towards recovery while dealing with this. They’ll be ups and downs. Each time you feel like you’re back at square one, you’re already equipped with all the tools that helped you regress before. What i’m trying to say is, don’t let setbacks make you feel like you’re not recovering. Recovery from our shared feeling is never linear.

Another tip, when you catch yourself thinking about DP/DR again after a while of not, don’t get discouraged. Instead of thinking, “Fuck, I thought about it again”, say, “I didn’t think about for a while, good job”, stuff like that. It may seem obvious but it can be harder than it sounds. Right after that positive self talk, think about something else or go back to focusing on what you were doing. I know it’s easier said than done but all we can do is try.

Anxiety,16thenk,lyt3m0r,"Thank you so much your post is like the bible for PRDR. I have literally screenshotted the post and your detailed replies, as a tool to help if I ever freak out in another episode. I had my first one yesterday after witnessing a stressful thing and when I felt ‘unreal’ I started to freak out. Luckily I found your post that same afternoon and I cannot thank you enough for all your time and effort to impart this knowledge. Had I ruminated on this experience and feed into the feedback loop, I’m sure I would have kept on spiraling. God bless you, you kind soul! How are you doing these days?",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lz32aaj,"It’s still hard for me to imagine what “recovery” would even look like. I’ve personally been dealing with DPDR for the last 14 years. At first it was on and off but a few years in and it became 24/7. At this point, most of the time I don’t even feel anxious or uncomfortable. But, my mind just isn’t there and I am just so disconnected. It can really make it hard to live my life. I will say prayer, worship, and reading my Bible does make it a bit easier. All the wordly “techniques” have been ineffective for me personally. I think finding identity in Christ has been one of the most important things for me.",3

Anxiety,16thenk,mxc5k4n,"i just cried.. i’m not alone, i’m not alone in this 😭😭. i have struggled for 5 YEARS with dissociation and it has been in the driver seat this whole time. i have missed out on so many events and invites because i didn’t want to get triggered. i missed classes for almost a month because it randomly came to me one day. it all started with just one edible in high school and im nearing the end of college and it has still had a grip on me. i am emotional right now and this post is old but it is a gem. i will try these things and hopefully it will help me. alcohol has been the only thing that will calm my anxiety and i knowwww it sounds horrible i know. but everyone around me smokes and it’s just so hard sometimes trying to not focus on the smell and get triggered. thank you so much OP i will save this and try this and see if maybe i can be in control now ",3
Anxiety,16thenk,n0otei5,"I had it for two straight years, I continued to drink alcohol and actually picked up smoking again, I was that miserable. BUT I kept doing things I would normally do, even though I didn't enjoy them the same. I even joined a eightball team for a year, every game was sheer terrifying but I kept going. I rejoined a band and for the first time felt ok on stage because it took my mind away from Dpdr just that little bit more, coming off stage I was nervous, it was the complete reverse. Anyway, each gig got more fun and by December last year I felt a shift for like 2 weeks, then BAM back into full Derealisation. This went on and off until February this year. I hit the 2 week mark, and thought ok I'm ready for it, bring it back again.... Went on with my business as usual and it was week 3.... I thought hmmmm well I won't get my hopes up, week 4.... I started to get a bit excited, by week 5 I was letting my family know this is the longest I've felt ok. I'm not back but I think this might be the shift in recovery I was reading about ... I felt happy and then just got back on with it. Now it's the end of June and I'm still in recovery I think, but I just don't think of it like I use to. I promised myself that once I'd recovered, I'd come back to help others. So here I am.... No, it's not a life sentence, and even though it don't feel 100%, I dont feel it enough to think about it every second of every day now, it's more like once in 3 days I'm like, oh dpdr that's right lol. Have a think how bad I was and think, thank god that's over now lol. I thought I would be like this forever, but nah ... It's just a phase of life once the initial stress that cause it is gone, in my case it was severe injury and work stress, and dealing with Centrelink for 2 very headache years. You guys will come good, just stay positive (as best you can) and keep pushing for control back by engaging in life whatever it is you did before that made you happy. I know how bad it feels, worst feeling I've had in my life and I've been through a lot. All the best!! 👍",3

Anxiety,16thenk,lpt8wsy,"u/Eirwynzure Congratulations on your recovery. I am so happy for you! I have been dealing with dpdr for the last 7 months. I have made some progress. I recently felt like I was waking up from a dream and got some of my feelings back but I still feel very weird. I am suffering from extreme existential thoughts, even scared of my own existence sometimes. I look at myself and I am like, so who I am in this body? Where I am in this body? how do I think? How do I funcion? How do I talk? It feels like I have high conscious awareness. Did you at any point have these symptoms?",2
Anxiety,16thenk,lqqwfa4,"Hello! Since I saw your post, my mood has completely changed, I no longer think about the signs of unrealization, except very rarely, such as this period. I learned that it is about anxiety, and I can say that I learned to control it just by accepting everything that happens to me, which is very important. For example, until your post I was afraid to drive because I thought I couldn’t concentrate behind the wheel, now I understand that I was like that only because I was thinking about it. Now I drive with almost no worries. 

 However, I still see in the fog and the most annoying thing is that I don’t feel the emotions, I don’t feel the love and the warmth of my soul, which makes me feel like a robot. 

I would like to ask you, in your healing process, what attitude did you take and how did it feel when the symptoms started to disappear? Apart from realizing that this brain defense mechanism will disappear and accepting this fact, what else could I do?

I would be happy if you could answer me, I would appreciate some advice from someone who has been cured.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,lqvv4mq,I’m going thru this rn it’s hard but I constantly remind myself it’s just a phase and I’ll snap out it’s hard tho because I have a marijuana addiction but In order to rid of this feeling i gotta stop thanks so much I thought I was the only one experiencing this  I’m 22 never thought  anxiety was a real thing till now I thought I was goin crazy … it’s such a relief I’m challenging my self everyday so I can feel normal again.,2
Anxiety,16thenk,ls37ixi,"This week has been one of the worst of my life. I've never experienced such anxiety, and I had no idea what was going on. Your post has given me so much hope. The way you worded everything, the reassurance. I truly believe that I can get through this, thank you forsharing your experience.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,ltirnb2,"Hi, I have very specific physical symptoms that I can identify and Id like to know if anybody else feels this way and if theyve managed to get rid of some. (I have dpdr) I have raging ear ringing which is worst when lying down and goes away during the day.  Every time while falling into sleep i feel this terrible and uncomfortable internal shaking and my hand sometimes jolts. Also seeing a lot differently, colours feel off especially while being in a store, for example supermarkets feel very unreal and it all looks just off it seems there are to many products and like theyre moving in motion while im walking.

Also a very scary one is computers. My head hurts so much while looking at screens and I cant read anything words are jumping and the visual snow is crazy.

Of course theres neck pain and weird random stabbing pains anywhere that last a couple of seconds.

What scares me the most is that my city feels off and strange to me and the jumpy letters on my computer. Has anybody else been dealing with these kinds of symptoms?

  
Edit- Also has anyone had afterimages and like light is flashing when you have your eyes closed?

And like this specific thing has been happening this week when i talk it sounds and feels weird. I just cant describe it enough my own voice sounds strange.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,lvhwe2z,"I’ve been dealing with this since April after a massive panic attack that was made to feel even more worse via diet weed (some compound marijuana in NC as plain THC isn’t legal there, which had several different types of things that they could pass for close enough that I never knew existed), and far more caffeine than I ever should have consumed in one day(over 500mg). I haven’t smoked anything since April but I’ve been at such a loss at how and why I’m feeling the way I felt. To hear it be put into words- I cannot describe it. I always had the hardest time explaining this sensation to those close to me, how could I? Other than saying it all felt like a dream, I don’t feel real, and it’s a massive disconnect. I was and still am constantly scared out of my mind it would be permanent and I’d never shake out of this but this in depth analysis has given me so much hope! I’m going to keep trying to continue forward- some days are indeed harder than others thanks to bad depression and some anxiety on top of all this- but knowing that it is something that CAN be helped, that Im not alone, and others have felt this way too… it has given me a much needed boost to this endeavor. Thank you so so so much, and I’m sorry for this little novel lol I’m just teary eyed and happy to have come to this post !",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lw4ywcw,"This thread is an absolute godsend, takes the fear out of DPDR even if its briefly and I have to read, re-read abd read again! Sometimes the DPDR really disables me, like physically and mentally. There have been a few days very recently where I've literally got out of bed and literally been rooted to a spot, for hours! Even the thought of moving anywhere is just too much. This frightens the hell out of me. I run my own business and on these days I've had to just cancel. My clients have been understanding so far...also does anyone else find that if they've had a relatively peaceful night with little anxiety and lessened DPDR, the next day is twice as bad? It's almost as if I've engaged too much! This is absolute hell on earth! ",2
Anxiety,16thenk,m21fe52,"Thank you so much for this story. I too am suffering with anxiety and associated DP/DR symptoms. I've had anxiety all my life, and learned to manage and live through it. I go through phases and sometimes the anxiety returns but I know it will go away eventually. All I can do is continue focusing on things that bring me value (even if it feels like it makes no sense, just do them!), engage in healthy things, relaxation exercises, and be patient as it takes a little while for the brain and hormones to adjust themselves and return to a normal, base level. 

My current anxiety started about 2 weeks ago. I had trouble sleeping, and next day I was extremely tired and anxious, which created that feedback loop. I wasn't DP/DR, just scared of not being able to sleep ever again, catastrophizing things. Then I was able to regain sleep, but I guess my brain decided ok, I must shield you from this threat in future, so its DP/DR time! This happened a few days ago. It gets worse at night. But today I woke up feeling much better. I know it will pass and go away. I've been there before. I still have lots to learn so I am seeking therapy so I can better prevent these things in the future, but as with anything in life, we need to get hurt to heal and develop a thicker skin. Anxiety is not your enemy. It is in fact a defense mechanism we inherited from our caveman days. It is there protect you, but with modern humans, we forget that, and end up getting trapped in that loop. Trust me, it will pass. It will get better. You are strong, and are going to come out stronger after this experience. 

  
It also helps to list out the good things about you. Perhaps write down 3 good things you've done today for yourself and others. Sharing your stories here is also a good thing, just like I am doing now.

  
I wish you a fast recovery, and all the happiness and peace that you deserve.",2

Anxiety,16thenk,m93mdch,"We appreciate you and this post, we really do. Especially if writing about it was a possible trigger for you.

I haven't had time to read it ALL but one thing I'd love to add to habits to get better is reducing scrolling (if you didn't mention it).

That loop of keeping my brain not tethered to reality is a massive trigger for myself and others. I have blocked my socials (using screenzen app - free on play store) and desperately try to find dopamine hits scrolling YouTube shorts and Reddit, nonetheless, breaking away from doom scrolling and social media has hands down been a major factor in my recovery.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,mba5kmo,"I wanted to personally thank you I am a 18 year old female at the moment kind of young to of been going through this the way i have For a little under a year (definitely didn’t help how scared i was for most of it with no one to ask my questions to) i read this post and the other one with the symptoms and i’ve never felt so heard and understood about my situation, it was always a touchy topic and it stressed me out from time to time (now less then before) every question i’ve ever had throughout you soothed it i will always come back to your post and again thank you this indirect reassurance has made me feel the best i’ve ever felt about my situation and i no longer feel like I am strange and I now feel like i can get over this and it’s not forever no matter the circumstances.

Anxiety,16thenk,myw08rj,"Excuse the pun but this post was Unreal... incredible stuff. I have had anxiety for about 8 years. It ebs and flows and I've had serious bouts of DPDR along the way. It's awful. Feels like I'm playing a first person video game. And you breakdown is spot on.

Been struggling again lately and this has just helped me to remember that these things that happen to us are real mechanisms. It isnt just a freak event, that is only happeneing to me. They can be reasoned with and overcome. 

My biggest struggle is the self-checking/self-fulfilling loop. I spend so much of my day worrying about how I'm feeling, my life priorities just fall apart and I find it hard to keep things together.

Really appreciated reading this so thanks, and to everyone else out there facing the struggle. 

You are still you. And you are doing just fine x

Big love to you all x",2
Anxiety,16thenk,ndmalaa,"Thank you very much for your post. It matches almost completely my symptoms and the way I managed to get out of that hell 5 years ago. Even though I had some really good years and never thought I'd end up in this situation again, I've been struggling with it again for the last 1.5 years. It's really horrible because I actually know I've gotten out of it before. I lacked that knowledge back then; I thought, just like you, I'd stay like this forever. But because of my life circumstances, I just can't seem to fight my way out of it, no matter what I try. In addition to the visual and cognitive problems you describe, what's bothering me is extreme insomnia. I have really great difficulty relaxing or falling asleep at night. I wake up several times every night and am therefore very groggy during the day. As you yourself say, good sleep hygiene is very important for getting the whole thing under control and calming your nervous system. Can you recommend anything for this other than the usual methods (screen time, going to bed early, etc.?) Thank you again for sharing. You have reminded me of my own strength and given me courage that I have it in my hands to end this terrible situation.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,nfjsdec,Omg. Reading this gave me so much hope. I’m saving this post and coming back to it whenever I need to. It’s amazing to hear that no one’s DPDR is permanent.

I got checked and thankfully all brain tests came back normal, but whenever these episodes of dejavú happen, I get hit with the wave of DPDR and I feel as if I am losing control or going crazy or like if my brain is not healthy.

Anxiety,16thenk,l3oj3n0,"Forgive me if this is too personal of a question, did you experience a loss of libido or an altered relationship with intimacy? Thanks for your post. I’ve known I’ve had this stuff going on for about 3 years (took a breakup real hard and was using too much weed for a while) but I’ve just been white knuckling it. I was thinking today, why should I do that? Let’s figure out a plan. After i quit the weed over a year ago, the acuteness lessened greatly but it’s still there. I have a weird relationship with my hands, which is interesting to see is common (redness, wrinkles, size, etc) and can use it to justify a host of false beliefs about myself or my health. This one caused the most distress when I was actively smoking weed. These days I just feel like I’m assessing my interactions in real time often, like while I’m talking to people thinking stuff like (why did I say that etc) and it makes me less capable of good conversation. Have you ever heard anyone on ADHD medication mention it’s relation to DPDR? I suspect that some of the intensity of continuation can be attributed to my meds (adderall) i think it can make me focus inward real hard instead of outward. I’ve been playing the positives vs negatives game and I think the negatives have won sadly and think I need to stop. Overall I just wanna reconnect with my emotions and feel “locked in” again. I think confidence plays a big part in it for me as well I have low self esteem but sometimes I can muster up a “dude you got this shit fuck yeah let’s lock in” and it improves. I think I just need to dive into the fear instead of sitting beside it. 

But anyways thank you for your post and your continued effort in assisting people. As someone with experience in the field of psychology it means a lot.",1

Anxiety,16thenk,la6c224,"Madness, this relates to me so bad right now and for the past five years on/off! Mainly on though - five years ago myself and family were on route to the airport for a family holiday to Morocco but I was taken ill to hospital and ever since I have suffered with anxiety but especially whilst away on any holiday! 

I have had had around 14 anaphylaxis episodes due to not knowing what I was allergic too! Turns out it was wheat-exercise induced anaphylaxis (strange one!) but due to almost dying alot of times I think that has taken its toll on my mental health and induces a level of fear permanently but to any situation regardless whether it is life threatening or not. 

I have just been promoted at work which takes effect next week, this now means I run the company and responsible for absolutely everything but at the same time I’m currently on holiday which is my main trigger! (Being away from home kills me!) so the two combined are sending my anxiety symptoms into overdrive! 

Any advice would be appreciated, sometimes I feel perfect - other days I feel absolutely terrible, the one major thing I have found that helps is exercise but…. When going through a prolonged period of anxiety it’s very hard to pick up the motivation to gym and step away from the rubbish food! Especially with the dizziness/headache symptoms. 

You are a real inspiration and I cannot wait for the day I can say I have this under control.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,lbqo2xt,So I can really relate to this but you always feel like no one else’s symptoms match yours and therefore you feel like you have something undiagnosed etc. mine started 6 weeks ago with random spinning episodes for a few seconds where the whole room would spin and I’d almost have to pick my head up. Fast forward to now and I’m no longer spinning externally but feel like I am internally. I have such bad neck and shoulder pain but the most disturbing feeling for me which I find almost impossible to describe is this sensation I’ve got at the base of my skull. I can turn my head just slightly and it’s like my brain is moving inside my head which then makes me feel so disorientated that I lay back down. I feel facial pressure too slightly. I’ve had a brain and neck mri both of which were fine but I feel like I’m losing my mind here and really scared,1

I’ve been on antidepressants but it doesn’t seem like the ones I’ve tried are working yet at least I’ve been on Prozac for like 6-7 weeks and just got started on bupropion like a week and a half ago do you think derealization could be causing my depression and anxiety and do you think meds would help ?,1

Anxiety,16thenk,llbramo,"Hi! I Just wanted to share my experience and ask you some advice. I originally got derealization from a bad trip three months ago. That night I was at a friend’s house and I smoked too much (I smoked very few times before then). I had visions, my legs were shaking, my head was spinning, and I would get lost really deep in my thoughts. I knew I was having a bad trip, but I was still terrified by the fact that I couldn’t manage to control my thoughts. I tried calming myself down by talking about it with a friend of mine that I trusted, but that night he was drunk so while I was talking to him he would get distracted, and that upset me even more. I eventually decided to go to my room (isolating myself even more, not a bright idea), where I tried to listen to music, which didn’t help at all so I just decided to try to fall asleep. I remember trying to go brush my teeth and put my pijamas on for like 15 minutes because I kept forgetting what I was doing. Even while trying to sleep, with my eyes closed there were just my thoughts and me, and once again I would keep forgetting what was happening. I eventually fell asleep, and the morning after I just remember being tired. I think my derealization kicked in when I sat on the bus directed to my house, when I started to think about the night before. I remember that I had take my earphones off because I started to feel like everything was suddenly blurry (listening to music is my favorite activity, just think about it). I had derealization for just a week, thanks to having my friends distract me and by playing videogames, watching movies and by writing my thoughts and progress on a diary app (DailyBean on IOS, for who’s struggling I recommend u check it out). And except one time in which I suddenly had the fear it would come back, I completely forgot about it and I continued living my life almost like nothing happened. It was easy because one day while doing research I read that 50% of the population eventually experiences some kind of dissociation in their life, so I thought “It’s just a one-time thing, I’ll get through it”. But then, a week ago I had to take two make-up exams (got depressed in april-may because of school) and the night before the first exams, while revising in my room, I (obviously) started to feel anxious, but then what’s strange is that I suddenly started to feel alone and scared. And my derealization returned. Even now, a few days after having the news that I passed both exams, I still have derealization, and I probably know why: now that it came back, I’m terrified of having to deal with derealization for the rest of my life. I’m scared that even if I get through it again I’ll know it WILL come back one day eventually. I’m scared of having another episode during AND AFTER my graduation exams, or while driving, and I’m scared I won’t be able to be even slightly anxious anymore because I might have another episode. I will go to a therapist in a few days and I’m scared she won’t help. I’m scared she will just give me meds and call it a day. After my first derealization I felt I’ve grown mentally, and I became more thankful of the things around me. Is it not enough? How can I stop the feedback cicle if I can’t even tell if I’ll ever overcome the derealization for good?",1

I'd just like to ask you this because I've been considering this... I wonder if my 'vision' problems are actually just a form of dp/dr (which I'm not very afraid of if I was to have it, just because I know it can't hurt me).

The reason why I'm asking is because despite always just saying that my vision is blurry, it doesn't actually necessarily look that way. I feel like double vision or a blurry vision would be very easily noticeable. Yet most of the time I see just fine, especially if I focus on something. All the details are there etc. Yet something still feels off. At times the world does in fact feel like a dream/there's something separating me from the world. 

What troubles me though is that I cannot tell. Because dp/dr isn't a physical thing but a subjective experence, it cannot be fully explained to someone else. Is it possible for me to have it very subtly and still have derealization? Because people mention very extreme things like feeling completely disconnected, or seeing things 2D etc. I don't have that. Yet, it still feels off. 

Whats your experience with this? How were you able to tell it's definitely dp/dr and do you think it can be experienced subtly yet constantly? 

Thank you again",1
Anxiety,16thenk,lnb8jzd,"Hi. Would this advance for healing from DP/DR also work for, long term health anxiety,  OCD thoughts and PTSD? I've suffered long-term chronic anxiety for years,  it's just exploded into crippling off the chart symptoms.  No life, no job,family is falling apart due to my anxiety.

Have you been able to return to drinking caffeine?
Do you have adhd/autism/ocd? 
I have autism and I’m trying to get adhd testing on the recommendation of the people who tested me for autism, and I’ve read a lot about how adhd people are more prone to getting this problem, and also that the stimulants used to treat Adhd often have the effect of treating the dpdr/related anhedonia .

Anxiety,16thenk,lqlgyou,"Vielen Dank für diesen super Beitrag ich selbst mache eine dpdr durch seit ca.6 Wochen und diese ist entstanden durch meine hypochondrie weil ich mich wochen lang gestresst habe das ich krank bin und habe mir extreme angst gemacht an einer psychischen Erkrankungen zu leiden oder sie zu bekommen und da setzte die dpdr ein und ich hab gedacht ich bin verrückt oder besser gesagt ich werde verrückt jetzt ist es so das ich mich so langsam das ich keine Angst mehr versuche zu zeigen vor den Symptomen und bin sehr oft wie in 2 Zuständen heisst wo ich innerlich alles abchecke  bin ich da bin ich abwesend war ich das bin ich noch ich ? 
Und dann wieder zur  Realität zurück kommen so in die Richtung hast du das mit feedbackschleifen gemeint ? 
Des weiteren hatte ich panische Angst davor schizophrenie zu entwickeln und eine DIS  und deswegen prüfe uch teilweise meine ganzen tag ob ich noch alles weiss und ob ich Anwesend war sag mir immer meine Lebensgeschichte auf um zu beruhigen und ich glaube das hält meine dpdr auch noch aufrecht ? ",1

Anxiety,16thenk,lu8lwoj,"so i have a question. How do you stop feeling “scared” to be alive bc it feels like it won’t go away? Right now im dealing with panic attacks every day that make me violently shake, im dealing with hot flashes, bathroom issues, AND depersonalization because i feel like i dont know who i am. i feel like im not the one inside my body and idk how to come back to “reality”. it’s not as scary as it used to be when i was a teenager but it feels like it’ll last forever. I feel like im not who i was just 2 weeks ago. Did you feel with this as well? I tried to DM you if you are ever able to respond and maybe we can talk one on one. I really appreciate this post because it drastically helped me pull through a major panic attack a few days ago",1

Anxiety,16thenk,lzpk1ea,"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. You explained it so well, and it's genuinely so scary when I get derealization even though it's starting to get better. It happened a few years back when I had anxiety, and it lasted like a year or two, and sometimes to the point I can't tell if it's derealization anymore. It's getting better now, and I feel like I only get it when I don't get enough sleep. When I had derealization the first few times, I got so uneasy and scared, which led me to panic attacks. Whenever I get an episode, I feel as if I'm observing outside my body and that I'm so distant from the world. idk how to explain. I feel like I'm in somebody's perspective in a video game, and people aren't real. Now, when I get it, I try to calm down even if it's still kinda scary. However, when I do get derealization I just try and focus on something that I like doing and try to feel my surroundings and tell myself you're okay.",1

Anxiety,16thenk,m30dad4,i know this is an old post but thank you for sharing! i struggle with DPDR and deal with everything you mentioned. i also struggle a LOT with depression and emotional numbness. all of my emotions feel “stuck” inside of me and i’m just there in life going through the motions. i feel like a zombie. i’m also so fatigued all the time i can’t ever make it through a full day without at least one nap. just curious if the emotional numbness was something you experienced at all? it’s like an extreme disconnect from myself and the world around me,1
Anxiety,16thenk,m36nbmj,I am so glad that I came across this post. I’ve was diagnosed with panic disorder 24 ish years ago. I have anxiety and panic attacks quite often but I’m currently in my second time of dealing with this specific body shut down in 10 years. I feel stuck. I feel like nothing will get better. But this brought some hope back to me.,1
Anxiety,16thenk,m4ub94d,"I’ve been suffering from dpdr for over 10 years.. 2 years being the worst suffering a human can endure. I’m to the point now where it’s the new normal for me. Ive managed to reduce the feeling about 70% so it’s still always mildly lingering. Just the thought of it will hit me full-force. It got to a point where I would always wear shades, even in a room.. bright lights seemed to make things a lot worse. I truly believe smoking weed at a young age ruined me. My first dpdr experience happened when I was 15 after smoking weed for the first time.. I’m 27 now. 

The 2 years I’m referring to being the worst years of my life is when I started taking Xanax to help with my dpdr, it would really help me so I kept taking them to the point where once it wore off, the dpdr would hit me like a freight train, mornings were the worst. Once I got off the Xanax that’s when things really got bad. I honestly don’t even have the vocabulary word to describe these feelings. I’d say I felt like I was stuck in a Virtual Reality game where my hands and body wasn’t real and nothing around me was real at all. I truly thought I was schizophrenic, but learned from my psychiatrist that ppl with schizophrenia don’t realize they have a problem but I always knew this way I felt wasn’t right.. so that’s a good thing. 

Things are better tho I must admit.. except the part where I don’t remember sh*t. And when I say I don’t remember shit I mean it.

Certain medicines will cause my dpdr to go haywire. Once I went to the ER and they gave me Benadryl through an IV and it was that that virtual reality sh*t all over again. I was paralyzed and couldn’t move. I was shaking. I was paranoid to the max. All the nurses came in and one of them said “I barely gave you any, that shouldn’t have happened” ever since then I stayed tf away from Benadryl.

Anyways sorry for the rant. I’m to the point where I can live my life almost normal and I’m more than happy with that. I truly thought I’d be stuck like that forever",1

Anxiety,16thenk,mm8i1uw,Hey i read your posts can you dm me please? i need help,1
Anxiety,16thenk,mmfzxff,"First of all thank you so much for this post. When I'm having an episode it's really hard to remember everything I have read or tried before. I will save this and keep it as a emergency read.



I am unsure of what to do about one thing tho.

you said ""you want to find or make oportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR""

also ""get busy and involved in life, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family,...""

and I agree with you. When I am having a mild enough episode, I do this and it works. But when it is a specially bad one and I try to do these things, I am unable to do them and that increases anxiety AND DP/DR symptoms.

For example. I try to hang out with friends and family but I am barely able to form phrases or describe anything. it's like I forget all the words I need for that conversation so I try to work around it but then I choose the wrong word and they get confused, ask questions, then I have to explain and it is exhausting.

Most of the things I need/like to do are very mental amd I need my brain to be working. If I am trying to read a book and I finish a chapter and I remember nothing by the end of it, it makes symptoms worse. If I can't learn a simple thing when I'm studying, or play games I like that require thinking strategically ( even if it's nothing too crazy ). all of these things increase the feeling of ""unrealness"" and makes everything worse. 

My roomate told me that maybe I have tok much time to think about these things. That hurt a lot bc since I can't do anything I like/need I do chores and other things around the house until I get exhausted (physically) and then I play games than I am able to manage. But I'm not doing these things because I have time. I actually dont have time but I cant do the things I should be doing.
Idk if that makes sense. haha


if anyone goes/went through this and managed to overcome it somehow I would appreciate an input. ❤️",1

Anxiety,16thenk,mnv6jbx,"Hi there, I’ve read through your reddit on DPDR and your anxiety and recovery and would love to chat with you and get some advice. I’ve been dealing with panic disorder for 10 years. DPDR being my biggest fear and trigger. Past 2 years I’ve become housebound and past 2 months pretty much bed bound. I have a huge obsession with the clear sky and dissosiating into it. My dissosiating gets so bad I completely “float up” and can’t feel absolutely anything in my body. It’s continued to get worse and worse and worse and now I’m just stuck in this cycle of pure panic 24/7. Now I have OCD fears so strong around the losing control and being stuck like this forever. I have a very hard time with the irrational beliefs around DPDR and I’ve been so disconnected the last couple months that i feel so hopeless. Would LOVE to talk with you seeing you suffered from alot of what I have. I’m also autistic/ADHD which makes everything so much harder. I’m to the point where my system is so hyper active I had to close my windows with sheets and I can’t look outside.

Anxiety,16thenk,mwt7842,"Mate, this is where i have been for 4 years!! The scariest thing is, i didn't even remember what it felt like before it started, it just became me. A few weeks ago i randomly while looking for a plaster for my little girl found some setraline i used to take (before some obe/psychotic break that started all this and i believed i no longer needed them)  and for some reason instinctively ate one like it wasnt a choice. For some reason, i persevered repeatedly hearing the phrase sometimes you have to go back to move forwards. 


It really didnt feel great, made anxiety feel even more crushing and went against everything i think about big pharma... Over the past few days i have felt my feet touch ground again, i can feel the wind, i have a history to the character i am and i feel like i actually am instead of being a floating thought and having to think my way through everything. Brain in a vat comes to mind. I just hope i dont fall back in again, im going to keep taking the setraline, it feels like ive just been given another chance at living. I'm sorry for anyone going through this and still has to find the way out, its a scary illness as it seems impossible to recognise for me whenever i fall into it... Really dont know how i survived this bout, but if your cracking and have tried all you can think of like me, maybe try some setraline to bring you down long enough to build some foundations to stand on.

Anxiety,16thenk,mx6qhda,"\*\*\*\*TRIGGER ALERT\*\*\*\*\*  
I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER ME , PLEASE !  


  
I cried when i read your post. I have anxious thoughts all the time, and what it keeps me in the loop is this thought every morning : Is this the reality? I don't try to find an answer but it just makes me feel very very scared. With this thought and the DP/DR , it makes me think : that if makes sense to do anything. I don't want to do a thing, i can't focus on a thing. I'm going outside, i've just drove 4000km with DP/DR, sometimes got better, sometimes was worse.   
I had health anxiety, i was checking everyday if the pain is still there for over a month and then everything started with a panic attack. After 2-3 months of anxiety , scaring of my thoughts, i started to analyze everything, why my dog is happy (he has more serotonine than me, things like this). I was able to manage this (more or less) but lately, i develop this thought that ruins my day from the first second of it: Is this the reality? ||  Yey, i'm playing Fifa with my friend, but what for?. Always these thoughts came also when i'm happy or feeling better.   
The funny thing is that i'm not searching for an answer of :Is this the reality? Is this my dog? It just scares me. And i keep repeating this thought over and over again during my day",1
Anxiety,16thenk,myocabq,"I know this is an older post but i believe i am experiencing this rn and i am so distraught and afraid its unreal (haha literally).

Idk if anyone will see this but i pray that doing these things reccomended work because im so scared i’ve never been so scared",1
Anxiety,16thenk,mz7itsu,"I'm not sure what DPDR feels like, but every 2 or so years it seems like I get a new worry. Just some random thing that basically cripples me for months, if not a year which eventually calms down until the next random thing makes me anxious. Currently going through one of those episodes now, but what I've noticed is that something feels off. I can't put my finger on it but I kind of feel like I'm dreaming, almost. I know I'm not. And remembering back, I can remember a bunch of moments like this when I was growing up, to be honest I'm unsure if I have felt like this all the time when growing up. 

The worst part is, these thoughts that make me anxious refuse to go away. I almost have an outburst of crying atleast once per day, and every moment outside of that is the thought being constantly in my minds eye. I just want it to go away and it never does. If I'm engrossed enough in a video game it kind of does but I know in the back of my mind it is there and more often than not it ends in me not being able to enjoy said video game anymore. 

I am 27 and I have basically done nothing in my life because I am also autistic and have social anxiety so the most basic of day to day adult things is difficult for me. But rewind about a year or two and I was always in Discord, having a laugh with my friends and always being the kind and fun loving friend. Now I'm a shadow of my former self. I barely have the effort to join in the voice chats with my friends, and it's not because I'm feeling detached from them, they're all amazing, it's just I think my mind is so occupied by this thought that I can't make much room for anything else. I feel like I've lost who I was.

I feel like I'm in a rut that there is no way out of. 

Sorry for the wall.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,n0h6y2g,I know I can overcome this,1
Anxiety,16thenk,n1u22s7,"In sixth form/ secondary school I was always left out and sad and awkward and had no friends and when everyone was talking and laughing I’d rack my brain for something to say and fail and I’d just come home and say everything to my parents and finally get to breathe and relax because I was with my parents and I got so close to them. but I kept studying to get a level grades for medicine where it would be my fresh start.  and then I actually got the grades and began medical school and it was amazing I was like a new person who was so friendly and confident and I made so many friends and I wasn’t awkward and I actually had things to say and all my views and opinions and thoughts changed to this new person and it was beautiful. I became less close to my parents because i had this independence but I still appreciated them. 
Towards the end of first year I got asked on a date and I went and when it ended the guy said he had a really good time and he was planning the next date and stuff and I just felt really good like maybe I am a person who can go on dates and talk to people and I was just really happy with how I was. 
I came back home that weekend and I was in bed and it was like a higher cognitive part of my mind just thought it for me- ‘promise not to do anything out the ordinary after 9pm’ and it was so weird and sudden. It wasn’t thinking it myself, it had like originated from a really self aware higher top part of my brain and I couldn’t argue with it/ access it / communicate with it. It was liek from above me. But when 9pm came I tried really hard not to do anything out the ordinary because this promise felt hanging above me, but of course i failed and kept blinking and talking lots and doing eveyrhthing out the ordinary. 
Then i felt that voice from the higher above parts of my mind say ‘ok, fine’ and it was like a punishment was coming and it felt so horrible. But I forgot about it and thought nothing bad would actually happen. A few minutes later, i felt myself connecting with my parents like i had done in sixth form and I felt ghe ‘new self’ I’d discovered in uni unravelling. All my new thoughts and beliefs were gone and I was stuck in this other person. 
The same thing kept happenign to me with these promises being made without any consent or thinking, but I told myself I have nothing to loose now anyway as I’ve already lost it so I don’t think they had any effect after the first one
When I went back to uni it felt like sixth form and I couldn’t survive there- like i literally felt like crying every day and I had to come home every weekend to relax and breathe again or it felt like explode (just like how I was in sixth form and school) 
Now it’s the summer break and I’m trying to undo the shift that happened from breaking the promise because I can’t live like this in university and I have to be able to make friends again 
I tried really hard to connect with that upper part of my brain again and the only way to go back to  my uni self was to talk to that upper part of my Brian and then it says ‘ok if you do absolutely nothing out the ordinary now.’ And it will say this a few times before I get the chance to do it again but it’s quite hard to connect with this voice and I’ve only done it a few times and each time I’ve done something out the ordinary and failed but I have until the end of summer holidays to fix it",1
Anxiety,16thenk,n2wt480,"Thank you for the great article and for taking the time to write it! I’m currently dealing with episodes of depersonalization/derealization (DP/DR), which are really scary. I’m also constantly afraid of every possible pain, thinking it’s probably the worst illness imaginable. I have a couple of questions:

* Do you ever feel an episode coming on? I often sense it starting, and then it gets worse.
* I’ve identified some stressors that trigger these feelings. For example, I realized the gym was one of them, so I quit. I’ve started exploring new hobbies like piano and paddle lessons.

I’ve always wanted to play the piano (or at least try), but I’m not sure if I’m enjoying it, and I think it might be connected to my DP/DR. I go to piano lessons right after work, which I don’t enjoy and often leaves me stressed. The lessons don’t help with that feeling. Trying to memorize the keys and incorporate my other hand with its own notes feels very difficult. A couple of times, I’ve felt DP/DR episodes coming on while trying to remember keys or use my second hand. I don’t have memory problems, but I get frustrated easily, and since I’ve experienced these episodes before, I’m now scared of facing them again. In your article, you mentioned that we should face and challenge these episodes, but I’m unsure whether I should confront them during lessons or if I genuinely don’t enjoy piano and should stop.

Anxiety,16thenk,nbafplb,"Hi, danke für die Tipps.
Auf einiges was du geschrieben hast, bin ich auch selbst gekommen und kann deine Tipps nur bestätigen.
Nur die Empfehlung für Ärzte kann ich nicht empfehlen. Auch wenn sich die Fachleute über DPR auskennen müssten - die meisten tun es nicht und machen dadurch alles schlimmer.


Nach längerer beruflicher Belastung geschah es, dass ich mitten in der Nacht meine erste Panikattacke erlitt. Daraufhin mehrere die dann in DPR endeten.
Mein erster Besuch beim Arzt, erhielt ich die Diagnose Depression mit dem Kommentar, dass ich mich auf eine längere Behandlung einstellen muss.
Ich ging in die Klinik und erwähnte dass ich Cannabis konsumiere. Mir es gegen die DPR in einer hohen Dosis hilft, aber ich nicht auf Dauer so hohe Dosen konsumieren möchte.
Nun verweigerte man mir eine Behandlung, sofern ich nicht ambulant auf die Entgiftung gehe. Daraufhin habe ich aufgehört Cannabis zu konsumieren. Mir wurden dann diverse Drogen von den Ärzten, die mir nicht sagen könnten, was mit mir los ist, angeboten. Für mich nicht nachvollziehbar, wieso ich Cannabis gegen Benzos tauschen sollte.
Die DPR würde schlimmer, aber ich habe das auf dem Entzug geschoben. 4 Monate später wurde ich in die Tagesklinik verlegt.


Bis dato habe ich Medikamente abgelehnt. Man sagte mir, dass ich nicht als behandlungswillig gelte, sofern ich keine Medikamente nehme. Ich hatte nicht das Gefühl arbeiten gehen zu können und benötige weiter eine Krankschreibung.
Also bekam ich Medikamente (Escitaloprame 20mg) und hoffte es wird besser. 
Solange ich in der Klinik war, ging es mir insgesamt besser, da ich abgelenkt war.
Dann kam Corona und man hat alle Patienten von heute auf morgen entlassen.


Erst als ich wieder Cannabis konsumierte verschwand die DPR.




Nach einen familiären Schicksalsschlag vor 2 Jahren kamen die Symptome wieder.
Ich dachte jetzt muss ich alles im Leben ändern... Ich bin selbst Schuld, dass dies wieder passiert. 
Ich versuchte mir medizinische Hilfe zu holen, was wiederum alles schlimmer macht.
Der Psychiater sagte ich könnte alles mögliche haben, wegen Cannabiskonsum.
Der Psychologe meinte es könnte ja vielleicht ne bipolare Störung sein.
Alle haben meine Ängste massiv nach oben getrieben und somit meine Erkrankung verschlimmert.
Ich habe mich nur noch als den übelsten Junky gesehen, anstatt das was ich bin.
Ich bin seit über 15 Jahren verheiratet, habe Haus, Hund, 2 Kinder und bin beruflich erfolgreich - aber das war nicht mehr greifbar für mich.


Von den Antidepressiva versuche ich nun seit Jahren wegzukommen - es ist einfacher kein Gras zu rauchen.


Fazit für mich. Ärzte können alles schlimmer machen. 


Aktuell stehe ich nur vor dem Problem mich gedanklich von der DPR zu lösen. Ich habe Angst sie aus dem Blick zu lassen. Sonst könnte sie mich wieder aus dem Nichts überraschen und umhauen.


Vielleicht macht es Sinn mir einen Notfallplan zu erstellen?",1

Anxiety,16thenk,ncssaiy,"I know this is so late, but I’m currently experiencing DP-DR after having a heavy stress period. I just suddenly got depressed and anxious (I have a history of severe health anxiety) even though I’m actually a happy person I think? I’m not a depressed person, so I suspected it came from all the build pup of stress + birth control pills so I decided to switch birth control pills but then I gradually started getting DP-DR while taking the new pills. I stopped taking those pills because I felt so horrible and everything felt so distant and unreal. I literally felt like an alien. I would say that I’m better now (it’s been almost a month since I stopped the pill) but I still have the symptoms I think. I just still feel weird looking through my own eyes if that makes sense? Like what how am I seeing these things? Or Im suddenly super scared of death having a catastrophic injury. Like completely deep thoughts that haunt me whenever I’m almost feeling happy in a moment! When I’m distracted and busy it’s certainly better, but I keep checking in. I honestly don’t know at this point if I have DP-DR at the moment because my vision is completely fine, I just sometimes find it hard to grip that what I’m seeing is real. Maybe someone has an answer?

Anxiety,16thenk,k30imoo,"Congratulations on recovery!!! I hope you dont mind my essay of questions.

I (F, 23) have had DPDR for nine months now, it's my second time having it. First time was triggered due to the >!r-word!< three years ago, and the second – and current – time was triggered from the high stress and anxiety of trying to adjust to the switch of life after university, and to working full time. All this coupled with the fact that I have had GAD and health anxiety since I was 7, and am also autistic.

I have gotten my life back-ish because for the first month of this second bout, I was just suffering. I now socialise, continued my driving lessons (still a big trigger for me) and work full-time again. 

Over the year, my DPDR has gone from chronically being a 10/10 in terms of severity, and now it's sitting at like a 4. I have had weeks without it too, or weeks where it was at like a 1 or 2 in terms of severity and it was easy to just ignore. Now it's bad again, at around 4 on average and then spiking to 10 when it's really bad. I know it's just a setback, I think most people in their DPDR recovery have a few setbacks. It stills sucks though, how do I keep being hopeful? 

I navigate the day at around a 4/10, and then it spikes at work, in new/unfamiliar places or when I'm driving. A symptom I have is things look unfamiliar, but even my workplace which I see five times a week? Like my health anxiety is telling me it's psychosis or schizophrenia, and that there's no hope for recovery. 

And I know, logically, it goes away. It went away for a year. First had it april 2021, gone by January 2022 through spite and constant exposure 😅 and it came back again, January 2023. But emotionally, I feel like I'll never come out the other side :(( 

It's so hard to keep going (that's a big statement, I know. I'm totally safe) and be hopeful. 

I currently get coaching sessions off the spirit coach, Robin! She's great!!! Things that have also helped are birth control – any hormonal regulation is a boost in recovery imo – ashwagandha, gratitude journal and yoga (and meditation) every day! But it's just that little bit left :( 

In my last bout of dpdr, I just woke up one day and the symptoms vanished. Right now I can only get a six-week break at a time or so?",1

Anxiety,16thenk,kjers14,"OP: did you work or study when you were in that state? Did you have any friends/partners to use as a crutch?

I've had it for about 6 months while unemployed, it was brutal, mind would race from GAD and at around 2-3 pm it would turn off and disassociate into a floaty out of body state where I couldn't absorb information or understand what people are saying to me. I managed to get a job, and a relationship and things improved, but now both are ending and it's creeping back up. I know my anxiety/GAD/neverending chatter rips my mind apart until it starts to disassociate or escape into shitty coping mechanisms browsing internet to self soothe but only waste the entire day if I don't find something to do and feel like shit waking up the next day to repeat the cycle. And depression keeps me from not leaving the bed til noon knowing once I'm away the mind will race. And I've been like this from 20s.

I'm 42 now and I can't keep living like this.

Also sounds like your self talk towards thanking DPDR for trying to protect you is a lot like internal family systems therapy. I wasn't sure it works or is for me until I've read your post and it sounds like you self taught/talked yourself using those methods.

Anxiety,16thenk,lhqwdx6,"I'm sorry this took an incredibly long time to get back to you on, my notifications have been pretty swamped. Also I am so sorry for the amount of times I'm going to say check in, in this post, gah!

For me, the checking in bit was a bit tricky especially at the beginning! What's really important is that when you find yourself 'checking in', try and 'check out'.

'Checking in' itself is not inherently bad, per say. 'Checking in' is only bad when it is  extremely repetitive, you are finding yourself unable to be reassured, you are being irrational, you are ruminating on what you're 'checking in' on, you are unable to 'check out' and you're feeling consumed by it.

Every little check in isn't a slip-up, it isn't making you worse, it isn't putting you back at square one. In fact what checking in is trying to do, is establishing trust with you!

When you check in its your body/mind going 'okay have we got control of this? everything good?' and **what we want is** 'yep, we're all good. thanks!' that is you 'checking out'.

**What we DON'T want** is you checking in going, 'okay is this symptom still here?' and you going 'oh god that symptom is still here, I don't like that, that's not good. What other symptoms are there, lets see if I can check. Oh, there's another symptom, I think there's something wrong with me, I think I'm sick, I need to Google this'. 

In that latter example, you are feeding your Health Anxiety with irrational thoughts (anxious thoughts) and you weren't able to check out. You are stuck, you are ruminating.

When check ins happen, you want to be able to check out, and we should do that with rational thoughts and approaches. When you do this enough, you'll notice (or maybe even not notice!) that you'll find yourself checking in less and eventually you'll stop completely in the future.

When you keep giving it the same, rational answers every time, eventually you'll start to trust yourself and stop checking in as much. Because it knows what answers to expect, and those answers can be 'I'm okay!', 'Yeah I'm good, just anxious' 'this is just Health Anxiety' 'these symptoms can't hurt me'.

You basically want to be able to make sure that you're not indulging in the opportunity to ruminate on anxious thoughts. You just want to be like, 'yep all good' and then go back to doing what you were doing before you checked in, like doing a hobby, a chore or whatever else. That can help distract you from getting sucked back in for a while.

The need to do it goes away eventually! For me I eventually ended up going months without checking-in, and now that my Anxiety is gone I've not checked-in for years and will probably never have the need to, ever again.

All this to say very basically: checking in isn't bad, but how you approach it and tackle it is and that is what causes the harm and can feed the anxious loop. When you do check in, remember to check out with a rational answer and rational thought.",13
Anxiety,16thenk,ld8hdir,"I don’t know if this will work or not. But I just thought about it while reading your post. I also struggle massively with dissociation. I was thinking on when I catch myself checking in to tell myself I will do it later .. almost like scheduling time to do a check in so it doesn’t feel like I need to do it right this second. It’s similar to the worry technique when you start to worry about something and go, no no.. I will worry about that at 4pm as now I am going to be present in my task. Maybe this will work! And over time we can keep pushing back the time to where we don’t have to check in. Who knows, just a random thought !",3

Anxiety,16thenk,k33w8et,"Hiya! Thank you so much for your kind words, sorry I didn't get back to you sooner!
It was always about remembering to be kind to myself. Reminding myself that my anxiety is just a product of trying to help me cope or navigate scary things while I hadn't developed other coping mechanisms/defences yet!
................................................................................

Here's a couple of things you can practice/do at home, in your own time. After these ones I'll write some techniques/strategies for when you're not at home:

- Say if I had a plan that day that I just couldn't go through with (like an appointment or seeing a friend) because I was too anxious or feeling uncomfortable DP/DR symptoms I would not punish myself, I would not belittle myself. When I was being treated for Agoraphobia, my counsellor told me that it didn't matter if I couldn't manage that plan or that day, even if it snowballed into days or weeks. The fact I even THOUGHT about wanting to try and really wanted to, meant a whole lot and that in itself meant I hadn't given up yet and I still cared. This kindness to myself made it easier to pick myself up and try again another day, your bad days affecting your plans is not a failure, and you are not a failure. And one bad day after a bunch of good days is not you 'going back' or 'taking steps back', its good to not catastrophize bad days. They are just bad times, and just like time, it passes and it is only a small moment in the grand span. It'd be insane if we could go our entire lives with only good days, nobody in this world has experienced that, bad days are human and you aren't alone in having them.

-  I'd remember to reward myself or comfort myself with things that made dealing with the day a lot easier. On bad DP/DR days, or high anxiety days or days where I really challenged myself I would reward myself with a comfort, no matter what or if I felt like I deserved it or didn't. My comforts were: watching TV shows/movies lying down on my side (to cope with my dizziness and DP/DR symptoms), retreating to my safe space (into my bed and/or next to my partner), watch my partner play videogames (as I was often too dizzy to play them myself so he'd play games I loved for me to watch while I was lying down too), wrap myself in my weighted blanket (helped me feel 'grounded'), listening to music I love/doing things I love (parttaking in things you loved before DP/DR helps you stay connected to yourself). You need to be able to do things that feels like a 'break' or a reward so that you're not challenging yourself too much into exhaustion.

- Establish and figure out your comforts, things that help distract, alleviate or things that you can reward yourself with. Figure out what aspects of DP/DR are difficult to handle for you, and does anything help you cope? Does lying down on your side help the dizziness? Then do things lying down as your reward/comfort for as long as you need. Does reconnecting with things you know you love help you feel a bit closer to being yourself again? Then listen listen to that music, watch those shows, read those books, reconnect. There's loads of different things you can do and may bring you comfort. Everything that brings you comfort or can distract you can become your tool, your way to reward yourself. You can grant yourself these comforts anytime, it shouldn't just be for achievement.

- For a little while I kept a journal, where I'd write:
The current date and year
Describing todays symptoms and thoughts about the symptoms
A rating of 10, and this rating would be how well I could handle/cope with my symptoms that day, **not about how bad the symptoms felt, but how well I could cope with them**. 0 being the lowest (difficult to cope) and 10 being the highest (feeling symptoms but coping well and managing). I started using my diary as a space where I could talk to myself about how I'm feeling, what I'm feeling and why and to reassure myself it was anxiety. Some examples in my diary of what these entries would look like: https://imgur.com/a/RTrW2tV
I noticed after doing that and using my diary as an opportunity to be kinder to myself and reassuring, as well as acknowledging my anxiety, I found a huge increase in my days being more manageable (often about 7 or 8 out of 10) even if I was still feeling DP/DR symptoms. I'd really recommend that even if you don't do a diary, make sure to spend some time being kind to yourself emotionally and engaging with tools or comforting posts that can help you navigate your anxiety/DPDR, and bring you comfort when things are tough. The important thing is not to be hard on yourself, your body is just trying to help you cope (with very annoying, uncomfortable symptoms).

Using my diary helped me completely cement the idea and correlation that my DP/DR was part of a feedback loop of anxiety, and by acknowledging my anxiety and its part in how it made days more difficult to manage I started to become more accepting of its effect on my DP/DR. This ended up helping me on the road to completely recovering from DP/DR as I knew 1000% it was just anxiety causing it, and I managed to conquer it.  It won't be completely linear and you will have times where it is hard to believe in it being anxiety, but that is simply a part of the process! You are not failing or taking a step back from the goal when you have times struggling to believe. 

................................................................................

Being outside with DP/DR can be absolutely terrifying, especially when you are feeling very unreal and/or dizzy. Some strategies/techniques I used when I wasn't at home:

- Breathing exercises (don't do this during a panic attack though or it could make you lightheaded), I know this is spoken about a million times but I feel like a lot of advice on breathing exercises is wrong and doesn't take into consideration people's personal anatomy. You don't need to hold/breathe out for a specific amount of time, what I did was I'd breathe in for as long as it felt comfortable (not like your chest gets super tight, just a bit full), hold one second, breathe out for as long as you like and repeat. Do this nice and slowly, feel yourself filling up and emptying out. When you teach yourself breathing exercises, it stores away into your nervous system, so next time you feel anxious or beginning to feel unreal your body will remember this information and will eventually automatically correct your breathing and help you calm down quicker. We want to be able to stop or calm down from a panic attack that could potentially put you back in a Feedback Loop.

- Grounding exercises are your friend, I made a small list & how to do them in the main post!

- Self-assurance matters, cut out the anxious thoughts and replace them with kinder alternatives. If you're outside and struggling with DP/DR, feeling unreal and it is making you anxious/panic, you might be thinking 'Oh god I feel unreal. I'm so scared, I feel like I might fall over, nothing feels real'. This can escalate the anxiety, the unreal feeling. What we want to do is change that narrative, when I felt like that I would try change my narrative to 'Oh I'm feeling unreal? That's okay, I'll just do as much as I can manage'. It all comes back to practicing self-kindness and still acknowledging your feelings, but not catastrophizing them.
I am acknowledging that I am feeling unreal, that those symptoms exist and that I am feeling them but I am trying not to be scared of them. These symptoms can't hurt you, they never can and they never will I promise you. DP/DR is just a defence mechanism that is trying to help you, because it thinks you can't handle it, so we've got to teach it that you can!

- If you are really struggling outside and nothing seems to work, it is okay to go home or to cancel your plans and try again! You are not a failure, you are not a bad friend, you are not a bad person, you are not weak, you are just a person who is trying to cope and is doing their best. You are working really hard even if people don't see it, even if maybe you don't believe it either. Every tiny step, every little accomplishment, every tiny thought that you want to get better, is you getting better and doing the work into getting better.

Anxiety,16thenk,kvhfdzu,"also I'm not sure if I am seeking some sort of unhealthy validation, because my thoughts resemble ocd pretty closely.

Anxiety,16thenk,l2ojnml,"Distraction is not the main focus or the main part, confronting sources of DPDR is and it's triggers, which I've explained in my post and you may have overlooked. Its about establishing trust between what you're experiencing and what you can handle, and you do that by engaging with the world and distracting yourself from cyclical thoughts that keep DPDR active but also by shutting down those thoughts by challenging yourself on things.

Also helps by partaking in things that DPDR/Anxiety tried to make you avoid, as by distancing yourself from things makes it stronger and keeps it as an option to you as a defence mechanism.

Its not about distracting it until it disappears, distraction is just a tiny bit of what I wrote that you've focused on. A lot of it was talking about how the feedback cycle works.

This is what has worked for me and countless of others and I'm simply sharing my experience into how it improved as my type of Anxiety/DPDR was due to ruminations, cyclical thoughts and avoidances.",2

Anxiety,16thenk,lwyui6a,"it is important to remember that it is no permanent and there are no permanent alterations to the brain. It is just induced by the THC, a panic attack that won't dissipate will create DP-DR and the constant checking will feed the loop and prolong it. 

It is a very natural phenomenon, your brain is trying to protect you. Everything OP mentioned to a T is a classic case of DP/DR and also everything she described in detail is how you get out of it. This is the most informative post ever written on the subject and also the most clearly thought out level of action to fight it. You need to acknowledge no matter how hard. that it is your friend, it doesn't feel like it, but it is.  

The fear of losing the mind is making it worse, you won't. THC will cause it 100% and unfortunately while on THC is impossible to escape the loop. Give it time to clear out of the system and also don't consume anymore stressful substances ( nicotine, weed, caffeine). But most of all don't check or check and acknowledge that it's there for your own good and it's natural and treat it as a level of trust as OP described. 

Your mind needs to feel completely confident and at ease that you can handle stressors again. So please stay close to loved ones, and engage in every day activities like before, even if it seems hard, do as much as you can. Don't engage in the spiral of feeding the loop, because you are going to prolong it. Don't isolate and give your brain time to think about how unreal everything feels. Engage with hobbies, friends, and practice self-compassion. You are going through a hard time and deserve to be heard and loved and encouraged. It is not a weakness to ask help from friends, family and professionals. It is not weak to have to even take medications if necessary. You are strong and you got this, remember that it is the THC that caused it, and will go away.",2

Anxiety,16thenk,l0aaeo9,"First of all, absolutely fab you got all your tests done and they're all normal. Thats a really good foundation to work on to get yourself rationalising that you're okay!

Whats happening is as you said, you start reacting with some form of fear (whether that is fear of losing control, going crazy, you're not well) in response to these phenomena (dejavu, nostalgia).

The fear while it feels rational, it is actually irrational because we have amazing information: you did your tests, and they're normal!
You absolutely cannot be going crazy, you cannot be losing control and your brain is a-okay! 

This is why you getting your tests done was a really awesome, great first step into combatting this problem. We've got a rational answer (your tests coming back normal) to help combat your irrationality (the fear you feel).

I'd recommend when you are experiencing moments of nostalgia and dejavu, the moment you feel fearful, DPDR or are experiencing your irrational thoughts of 'I'm not well, I'm going crazy' you should attempt to combat them with rational thinking instead which is:
'Well I can't be going crazy, my tests came back normal' 'oh I'm experiencing dejavu again? thats okay' 'it okay to feel scared' 'I've been through this before and I've always been okay' 'this can't hurt me' or rationalising with facts such as 'oh yeah, dejavu can be a bit worse when I'm stressed'. These are just a few examples, you basically should think thoughts that make you feel better, make you feel comforted, help you understand what you are going through, and walks you through it.

Any time you catch yourself thinking irrationally about your dejavu or DPDR, you'll want to correct it by following up with rational thoughts. You're not going to be perfect at it straight away! Its okay if you sometimes go back to feeling like 'oh I'm really scared right now', what we should do then is go. 'Well, its okay to feel scared, and I'm only feeling scared because I want to be okay. And I am okay'. 'my tests came back normal, so I know I'm just experiencing some stress or anxiety right now' 

Keep making sure you are looping back to kinder, rational thoughts whenever you accidentally slip up with the irrational ones. Once you keep doing this over and over, it becomes your natural response to confront things rationally instead of irrationally, and this eventually deconstructs Anxiety and stops allowing Anxiety to be your fear-response.",2

Anxiety,16thenk,lhweev5,"Yes! That's perfect.

When you are experiencing those attacks, its really important that you acknowledge it and meet it with rational thoughts just like you used in your example. Rational thoughts can be 'This is just anxiety, this will go away' 'this can't hurt me' 'this will go away' 'I am safe, I am okay' 'I've been through this before' 'I will get through this' etc. you can also do breathing exercises and grounding exercises if this helps you too.

Rational thoughts is using truth, and also reassuring words to get you through it. 

Anxiety (which is what causes DPDR) feeds off of IRRATIONAL thoughts, which are things like 'Oh my god I'm sick' 'there's something wrong with me' 'I'm going to die' 'I can't do this' 'I'm never going to be normal ever again' etc. When you feed Anxiety, it also feeds DPDR, and it makes everything feel worse, you might start hyperventilating, panicking and freaking out.

When you use rational thoughts instead of irrational ones, Anxiety can calm down and go away and will in turn, help DPDR to go away eventually. Its not easy, sometimes you'll slip back into the irrational thoughts and the panicky thoughts, but its really important you just go back to trying to calm yourself down, and being kind to yourself.

For me personally I quit caffeine 4 years ago and have never drank it since, not even decaf. I only drink water.

But I know people with Anxiety who successfully returned to having caffeine without it aggravating their condition further. If you feel your caffeine consumption isn't the cause of your Anxiety/isn't worsening then I'm sure you can continue to drink it!

But I'd recommend eating well WITH caffeine so its less of an Anxiety risk/your body isn't just caffeine. And try consuming less of it while you tackle Anxiety/DPDR. You don't have to go tee-total, but just be aware or know that caffeine consumption can be unhelpful for Anxiety/DPDR",3

Anxiety,16thenk,mjzmlv3,"Hey again!

I regularly had caffeine before DPDR, at least some form of it everyday for years. I then went 5-years caffeine free as of 2020 (when my anxiety symptoms developed to help combat my anxiety) until now in 2025 of which I've been anxiety free for 3yrs. 

Its funny you ask this question now because I finally tried caffeine again for the first time a few weeks ago (so perfect timing by you). So I can actually answer this 🥹

My first consumption of caffeine in 5 years meant I could feel the effects of the caffeine, I was very giddy and my chest was a little bit fluttery. You would definitely need to take it slow if you're reintroducing, try other lower forms of caffeine before you try coffee. Maybe even start with decaf as it still contains a small amount of caffeine. 

I've steadily worked to having one drink of caffeine every other day and have been completely fine! You can 100% work up back to it.

And yessss, I had major anhedonia as part of my symptoms. Throughout that period of time I enjoyed absolutely nothing, I experienced no joy or emotion even towards things I previously enjoyed. Throughout those years I did absolutely nothing other than lie in bed and watch a TV show just for company, but I had no enjoyment of anything. I couldn't even laugh for a long, long time. I didn't even listen to music because I felt nothing

All better now though of course!",2

Anxiety,16thenk,k5do02w,"I'm sorry this took me so long to get back to, I didn't get a notification for this in my inbox!

Set-backs happen, absolutely! I had a lot of set-backs and times where I'd just breakdown and think 'I'm never going to be normal again' 'I've ruined my life' etc. and then that'd cause me to freak out thinking that me freaking out has started the feedback loop again. But it doesn't! Set-backs are natural, and they actually won't impede your progress. 

It'll just stagnate a little bit! But you haven't screwed your chances on getting better. You're already doing some absolutely great things like your journal, yoga and meditation those are some of the best tools around. I think you need to remind yourself that you got to a good place before and that can happen again, its not a moment of time you've missed out on or won't get back to, it should remain as your goal and not dishearten you.
Also I can assure you 100000% you are not psychotic or developing schizophrenia (I also went through that horrible anxiety of thinking that for myself too)

In particular with journaling, I would write down everyday what I'm feeling anxious/stressed about or I'd write regular reminders that what I'm going through is just due to anxiety/stress. Use your journal as a way to be kind to yourself and talk yourself through what's up with you, and look for it in times of need or reassurance. Also try not to grade your days/weeks out of 10 based on how you're FEELING symptom wise, base your days out of 10 on how well you feel you can HANDLE the day DESPITE having symptoms. 
This rating would be about how well I could handle/cope with my symptoms that day. Not how bad the symptoms felt, but how well I could cope with them. 0 being the lowest (difficult to cope) and 10 being the highest (feeling symptoms but coping well and managing).

Doing this will take the pressure off of you trying to 'feel better' symptom-wise everyday (as we're not basing it on how well you feel) and instead how well you can manage despite your symptoms. That's the key, its about being able to develop tools and positive thought proccesses towards the days when we're feeling rough, because we want to make sure that if it ever comes back or we struggle again we've got the means and the knowledge and mental fortitude to tackle it again. We want to make sure we can have a functional time despite having symptoms, establishing a supportive relationship instead of trying to seperate the two. Because on the chance it comes back, or you have set-backs we want to have less 'Oh no its happening again, I can't take this anymore' and instead develop more 'Oh I'm feeling unreal/DPDR again? That's okay, I can do this'. Your mindset towards it will improve and it will help you combat it quicker when we figure out to handle the days, not the feelings. The feelings get intrinsically better when you can handle the days and the stressors and can manage them!

I just wanted to say as well, I am also Autistic and with you talking about work feeling 'unfamiliar' or 'unreal' despite being there often, I think you might actually also be experiencing overstimulation as well. When I am in clinical spaces like supermarkets/grocery stores, offices, work, dentists/doctors I get that immediate 'unreal' and 'unfamiliar' feeling. As an Autistic person, some sensory things such as overhead, bright lights and clinical spaces can make me feel extremely unreal, like I'm floating and nothing feels familiar, and when there's lots of people too. I usually feel better a few minutes after I leave, but you might not be coming down from that overstimulation because you're ruminating on the symptoms/unreal feeling, and also because you might be unaware that it could be overstimulation you might not have the tools to destimulate/decompress afterwards.
Especially as you might be driving home from work, which you've said is equally very stressful and a trigger for you. So even depsite coming out of an overstimulating environment, you're putting yourself in a new one until you get home in which you might not be able to come down from that.

Of course this is just a theory, coming from someone who is Autistic and also goes through similar periods still of unreal-ness when overstimulated. For you it could just be solely DPDR, not brushing that aside, just letting you know in case overstimulation wasn't something you thought about!

Overstimulation can feel like/might produce symptoms like:

- Feeling unreal, out of touch with yourself and your surroundings, all the same distortions DPDR can produce

- Speech can feel slow/like your brain is malfunctioning/its harder to think

- You might feel more emotionally numb, or even more volatile (you might snap at people more, you might suddenly cry, you might 'freak out'), you might feel socially drained

- You might sub-consciously stim to regulate in overstimulating environments (nail biting, leg bouncing, picking lips, playing with hair, playing with your sleeves/pens/items, repetitive movements or activity of any kind)

- Overhead lights or bright spaces make you feel vulnerable, exposed, on-edge, or like you can't breathe

and more. (The symptoms can be eerily close to DPDR!)

Anxiety,16thenk,ke5vpkr,"Hey, just wanted to let you know I'm real and I'm here! And I've read what you've said, I promise I don't get sick of responding and you are no bother at all and you are not a burden in case you feel that way. Thank you for expressing your feelings to me, and to talk about what you're dealing with. I'm sorry that what I'm writing is going to be really long, I hope you can read through it and bare with me!

You're absolutely sane, 100000% and I don't need to know you personally to know that. I went through your Reddit post history a bit and I can see you are really, really anxious and are going through a really hard time right now, a lot of what you've been posting/saying is really similar, honestly identical to what I was thinking/feeling when I was in a really bad place with Health Anxiety.

Whats happening is you are ruminating on these fears, and you are putting yourself constantly on edge by anticipating these fears happening (such as trying to see if you can hear things, you might be on edge thinking you might finally visually hallucinate, you are in constant fear). When you remain in anticipation and fear, you are making your cortisol levels and anxiety levels really high, and because you're anticipating these fears 24/7 your hormones are really high all day everyday. When this happens, your body will start producing symptoms due to the high-stress hormones that are rising in your body and aren't going back down.

I don't know if you saw it, but I have another post which goes over some symptoms you can experience when you're caught up in long-term anxiety cycles/have high anxiety and cortisol levels:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/  I would get dropping sensations, swaying, I'd feel like I'd fall through my bed or through the floor, I'd get dizzy/spinny vision and this was worse when I was trying to sleep. I felt like I would just float away from the earth or fall through it and that I was scrambling to just 'stay on the ground', I felt completely like the world was falling away or that I wasn't real, or I was going crazy.

I had the exact same thoughts as you, I would be practically on edge 24/7 waiting to hear voices, random noises would terrify me, I'd struggle to fall asleep because I was hyper-aware of sleeping sensations (I'd think I'd hear loud sounds, sometimes voices, my train of thought would turn into nonsense and it'd scare me, my own inner voice scared me), I was fully convinced I was turning psychotic/would develop schizophrenia despite never actually having auditory or visual hallucinations (other than when I'd try to fall asleep and that is very, very, very normal and is not an indication of psychosis. Its known as hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations). 

Absolutely everything you are experiencing, such as your dread, the swaying, the dizziness, the DP/DR, spinning, fear, is all anxiety and they cannot hurt you, and you cannot become psychotic because of it either! Nobody has, and nobody ever will I promise you : )

This is exactly what is happening to you, you had a bad experience with something that made you feel afraid (a bad weed experience), and now you think you're 'stuck in that high', that you've done permanent damage, like you're going crazy, that you're stuck. When the truth is, you've not been able to calm down or relax after a traumatic, fearful event that happened to you and because you can't calm down, your body is producing weird, uncomfortable symptoms (because of the hormones being amped up) that is making you even more scared. 

(I'M SENDING YOU ANOTHER POST BECAUSE I'VE ACCIDENTALLY WRITTEN TOO MUCH! There should be another reply to you from me with the rest of what I want to say <3)",2
Anxiety,16thenk,ke5vqvr,"(This is the 2nd bit of the post I sent you! read the other one first, I couldn't fit it all into one reply x)

You're getting stuck in a loop of fear, so here's some things I'll recommend you:

1. Figure out the root of your anxiety, figure out where it started. Personally from me reading your Reddit history, it sounds like your anxiety has started since you had a bad trip after smoking weed and now you're worrying that you've affected your brain, your health and your life because of it.

2. Rationalise and accept the facts: you have not ruined your life, you have not permanently affected your brain or your health, the drugs left your system a long time ago, you are just very anxious and scared at the thought that they haven't or that you've hurt yourself. You are just experiencing very, very bad anxiety and are ruminating on anxious and intrusive thoughts. You are okay, you are safe, you cannot become psychotic, you are not losing your mind, you are here and you will be okay.

3. I know it'll be hard, but please try your best not to drink alcohol if you can help it. I know you're in uni, so its hard to avoid but if you can limit your alcohol consumption when you can. Alcohol won't hurt you or make you worse, but alcohol can raise cortisol levels which can keep those weird symptoms (such as the swaying, dizziness, DP/DR) around as they're also a result of high cortisol levels! So by avoiding alcohol, drugs, caffeine (which all raise cortisol) you're giving your body an opportunity to lower its cortisol levels and will help you feel better faster/recover faster from this <3

4. You don't need to change your diet too much, but less sugar would help as sugar also raises cortisol! I'd recommend drinking more water, less sugary drinks/less sugary foods (you don't have to cut them out completely but less would help). We want to do everything we can to help your body lower your anxiety/cortisol levels, so cutting down on things like sugar, alcohol, drugs, caffeine is a really good start. Think of it as getting a head-start, your body is great at regulating things so it'll put less stress on you if you put less stress on your body!

Remember! Cortisol (and all hormones in the body) take some time to lower, this is because if hormones went up and down really fast or overnight we couldn't handle it, so instead our bodies make sure we decrease hormones (or even increase) them very slowly so we can handle it. So that means your symptoms won't go away overnight and that can be disheartening, but its important to keep pushing forwards and know that everyday you're working on yourself is another day with your hormones lowering, which means one day it'll all go away and you won't be as anxious anymore/have symptoms. You've just got to trust it (and me!). And remember that moments of 'relapse' (anxious thinking, panicking etc.) is very normal and is to be expected, you won't be perfect right away (just like none of us are the first time we try things) so don't be too hard on yourself. It isn't a step back! You are still making progress.

5. The fact you meditate and stuff is fantastic by the way. We should come up with more ideas on how to get you to relax during times you're about to panic or feel anxious but also when panicking. I'll come up with a list and I'll send it to you in a separate post so you can save it/get to it quickly if you want to read it over and over again. Is there anything you really enjoy doing? do you play videogames? do you have any hobbies? things you like?

6. For exercise because you asked, walking is the best exercise you can do when you're anxious, but honestly anything that gets the body moving! You want to burn off all that anxious energy out of you. I used to weightlift to help! I do walking now instead, though. Walking with or without headphones on is really helpful, by focusing on music or the sounds around you it can help you relax and feel 'present', like you exist. I recommend when you're having anxious thoughts you can't get out of your head, to go for a walk or to indulge in something you enjoy (your favourite TV show, favourite videos, music you like, something that feels familiar or comforting to you). You want to remind yourself that you are present, that you exist, that you have things you love/cherish/value, and when we remember we have history with things like ''Oh I love this show!'' or ''I remember how much I love this'' you're reminding yourself that you are real and that you have a past, that you exist.

7. Combat anxious thinking with positive, rational thoughts. If you're for example, feeling like you'll fall out of the sky instead think, ''Well I don't think I know anyone who has fallen out of the sky'', or if you're feeling very dizzy/swaying just think, ''Its okay, I'll take it easy and I know I'm only feeling this way because I am very anxious/and/or stressed right now''. Be kind to yourself, remind yourself your symptoms are just because you're anxious. You want to combat anxious thoughts (which are irrational) with rational thoughts (thoughts that help make sense of what you're feeling, facing your irrational thoughts with facts, even making humour/light of your bad thoughts can improve your thoughts). When you stop meeting fearful feelings with fearful thoughts you stop the cycle of fear. You want to fight fearful feelings with comfort, rational and kind thoughts because thats what will settle them down. I can help you come up with more rational thoughts/thinking that you can use against things you are scared of. Is there anything you experience/thoughts you experience that are scarier than others and have a hard time rationalising them/calming down from them? 

Sorry this is super long, this isn't the end of our conversation. Please, please respond to me when you get this, I really want to help you and I want to listen to you! I want you to keep talking to me and letting me know how you feel, and if you have any more questions please send them my way as well. I'm happy to answer anything and everything you've got, I'm always going to be here for you. I'm not going anywhere <3",2
Anxiety,16thenk,ke65gp6,"Aawww, you've got some really amazing hobbies I'm really jealous! I'm just getting back into playing guitar again myself. Those things are great though, that's exactly the sort of thing you'll want to keep doing no matter how you feel, power through the anxious thoughts and scary symptoms by doing stuff you like, such as guitar, running, being with friends. Its a good time to start saying 'yes' more to plans, to being social and doing things, the more immersed you get in what everyone else is doing or doing what you like the less time you'll be spending worrying about things. It'll be super scary, and you might not feel very 'present' at first because you might be thinking 'oh no I feel unreal, oh I feel anxious, I feel (insert scary symptom you might be feeling)' but if you choose to stay, to not run away and to just sit there and feel those feelings you'll start to feel braver facing them when they exist.

If you're really struggling, just work up to these things! I'd say doing stuff alone at home is probably the easiest, so picking up your guitar or listening to your music would be best. Acknowledge that you might being having anxious thoughts while you do them, accept that its okay if you are having a lot of anxious/racing thoughts, then just move on and keep doing what you're doing. When you keep pushing those thoughts aside you are saying ''Hey, I don't have the time for those thoughts right now'' and eventually? it'll give up. Anxiety likes to annoy you and keep trying to get at you, so you have to deprive it of the attention it wants.

I just want to say as well, if you notice you are itchy when you're anxious this is super normal and extremely common! Your body produces histamines when its anxious because of the adrenaline, and in people who are sensitive to these histamines they will start to itch! Its like a mini-allergic reaction to anxiety/adrenaline! Its not a dangerous reaction, you don't need to go to hospital or anything, but you can take an antihistamine if you want to help get rid of that 'itchy' feeling. You can use over the counter antihistamines! However I know you said you don't want to use medicines/ingestible medicine, so if you don't want to take antihistamines (as they can also make you drowsy) use some soothing lotions or calamine lotion on the areas that are itchy. It'll make you feel  a lot better : ) I've got a friend who experiences this and she uses a mixture of those remedies when she's anxious!

When you think of DP/DR or feel it, we should rationalise it first for example:
You might feel or think things such as ''Oh god I feel unreal, I don't like this, I'm scared, I feel like I am slipping away or going crazy'' but you'll want to trade it for thoughts that are more like

''We're feeling disassociated or DP/DR today? That's okay, that must mean I'm a bit stressed or anxious.'', ''I understand that DP/DR is a defense mechanism to help me not be hurt by traumatic, scary or intense feelings. It is trying to protect me.'' ''These feelings are scary but they are just temporary'', ''These symptoms suck, but lets keep going''. You're still acknowledging your feelings but you're not feeding into the fear with more fear, instead you're rationalising it and being kinder to yourself. We want to make sure you stop scaring yourself with scary thoughts (which are irrational) and instead replace them with positive thoughts that acknowledge your feelings. Your feelings matter so we don't want to push them away or think they're silly, we want your feelings to matter but to also prove to yourself that you are brave and strong.

Its okay to think and have thoughts as well, try not to be too hard on yourself and think you shouldn't have any thoughts at all/your inner voice needs to be completely silent. Whats most important/ideal is making those thoughts positive and defusing the negative/bad ones when we can. 

Some physical exercises you can do when you're feeling DP/DR or worried about it is things such as:
- Holding ice cubes, eating something cold. Anything with extreme temperatures can 'shock' your body into feeling more 'present' because these temperature differences are very noticable to experience, you can really feel the cold in your hand. Being able to feel and identify feelings/sensations is really important in 'grounding' yourself back into reality and helping DP/DR! I like holding ice cubes in my hands, pinging an elastic band against my wrist, eating ice cream, having a cold shower or splashing my face with cold water!
- Walk, runs, get active! Getting that anxious energy burnt out helps.
- When it gets tough, don't feel afraid to do things that make you feel safe. Weighted blankets, cuddling into bed, lying on your side while you watch TV (this helped when my dizziness/swaying felt too much to handle), do things that you know help you cope when it does get hard. Use these also, as ways to reward yourself if you've worked hard on improving yourself. On the days I was really dizzy/swaying but pushed through for example, by going outside even though I felt scared, unreal, dizzy and I successfully managed to go outside, I would come back home and reward myself with a comfort which was lying down for a while. Having a sense of relief or temporary escape can be really helpful.


(Sorry, wall of text again. Sending another reply!)",1
Anxiety,16thenk,ke65ij7,"(Part two, again hahaha)

I'll give you examples of all the things I did to relax, to challenge myself, or felt rewarding/comforting to me. I did all of these things no matter how I was feeling because I wanted to really push through the bad symptoms/bad thoughts:

I played videogames with my partner (if I was feeling too dizzy/swaying I would play them lying down on my side as a comfort), I weightlifted, I walked, I listened to music I love, watched familiar movies/TV shows, I would go charity shopping/antiquing (big hobby of mine!), I walked around in forests and listened to the birds/the wind, I played D&D, I cooked food with my partner, I would write, I would draw, I'd play card games with my family/siblings, I'd do puzzles, I went to the zoo for my birthday, I'd collect cool rocks/seashells, I'd pet my animals, I would spend Christmas with my family, I did everything I love and everything that made me happy.

I realise how much of those make me sound like an old fart for a 27 year old lmao, but I love doing them. I did all of these things even when I was horrifically anxious, where I felt like I would fall through the earth, I'd shake, I'd cry, sometimes I'd run and hide, sometimes I put on a really brave face and I'd break down after, I'd spend so much time in my head feeling scared, I'd despair, I'd feel unreal/dizzy/swaying, I'd have panic attacks, some days were easier some were harder, I wanted to give up, I would struggle to believe but I just kept going. I kept doing everything I could, I did everything I loved no matter how I felt because I wanted to be myself again, I let myself cry if I needed it and I got back out there. There was a lot of crying and feeling like I'd never be normal and then: one day I was, without even realising, completely myself again and I didn't realise because I eventually stopped worrying or thinking about feeling 'abnormal'. It just never crossed my mind again that I felt weird, anxious or unreal, or DP/DR I just... became myself again, at some point.

The big thing here is you should not let anxiety or DP/DR dictate what you can or can't do, what you should or shouldn't do. They're mechanisms that try to protect you, sure, but you want to teach it that you know better, that YOU know what you can handle and what you're able to do. You want to do everything you love and enjoy no matter how you're feeling until eventually anxiety and DP/DR trusts you, and leaves you alone.",1

So I personally was not working or studying in that state, I was tackling Agoraphobia at the same time as my Health Anxiety, as well as there being the COVID lockdown so I was pretty much confined in isolation by not just my mind but also with everything else going on. I did (and still do) have my partner, but I pretty much isolated myself completely from friends though because I didn't think anybody would understand what I was going through. My partner was my absolute rock throughout my struggle. I was basically bed-ridden, everyday was the same, I wasn't leaving my room, lived in completely monotony. 

Is there a particular pattern to what your anxious thoughts revolve around? Is there particular subject matter? Things that you consistently worry or are anxious about? If this is too personal, feel free not to answer, but if you do and would like your privacy please send me a private message. 
I was the exact same, racing mind, I'd completely disassociate, conversations couldn't absorb, I felt like a floaty vessel. I'm so sorry you're going through similar motions, you can feel so alienated in a world you exist in and struggle to stay present. Especially when you're losing out on connections such as work, and a relationship, it can be really isolating and life can be monotonous which can keep us very stuck in unhealthy habits but also an unstimulating environment where we're trapped with our own thoughts with nowhere to project them is hard. 

I didn't even realise there was a name for my technique I used, you just presented me with some new information hahaha! I am grateful for that. That way of self-teaching and methods not only helped with my Anxiety, but it helped and still helps practically everything I feel/deal with. I feel like I made radical progress in healing from my C-PTSD because of it too, and that was something I was struggling with for almost 10 years.

I think in approach to what therapy/therapeutic methods/practices to use or would work for you its important to figure out what your brain enjoys knowing or feels comfort in, and for me it was facts. I love facts, and facts make me feel safe, which is great because facts perfectly defeat or deal with irrationality which is what Anxiety is: irrational thoughts and irrational fears. So I started approaching things like my Anxiety & Agorpahobia with facts and care, understanding why we developed these mechanisms in the first place factually, understanding that they may have benefitted us in the past but don't necessarily benefit or work for us in the modern world/modern setting, understanding its built on irrationality and to combat it with rational thought, but to also accept that it (Anxiety) was just trying to do its job at protecting me, but that I want to teach it better/more effective/healthier ways to deal with life/things that scare me etc. 

Just wanted to teach myself that 'I've got this', establish trust in myself and eventually those previous mechanisms like Anxiety, PTSD etc. fade away because it knows I can handle this all by myself. Basically overwriting old, outdated defense mechanisms in my system for newer, more adaptive mechanisms that allow me to have more autonomy.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,kjteqlq,"Heya! I promise I'll get back to the other comment you've made as well by the way. Sorry this might be a very long and personal, but hopefully it might make you feel better or less alone.

So, I function super well now and I am extremely motivated and disciplined since I improved from my conditions. However, I am unemployed and have been for 10 years now due to everything that I've been through, so I am in a strange position to most people (but I am working towards employment) and I know people can consider me being unemployed as being undisciplined but I've managed to detach from that shame and other people's perception of my progress and what they consider to be disciplined. I know what I'm working towards, and I'm taking it at my own pace. For me my discipline comes from being able to keep my room tidy, I am maintaining my friendships better, I am maintaining my relationship, I do self-care every single day effortlessly, I can take care of my self effortlessly, I'm living a fulfilled life, I am not stuck in these cycles of despair or being unable to get out of bed anymore. Its important you don't consider your successes, your discipline or your self-worth on dare I say, capitalist ideals or people's toxic ideals of only 'work' and 'jobs' and 'education' being your only worth as a human being. When I managed to shake off that shame I felt even more motivated, because I know I am valued, I am worthy no matter what I do, and that I am doing everything at my own pace. I'm allowed to take my time, as are you, and you are valuable as you are even if you don't feel like you are.

My anxiety was just a small part of my struggle, but also my biggest success point in healing. I've technically struggled for over 14 years or so, with various things because of very unfortunate things that happened to me and I think my Health Anxiety/Agoraphobia period was the peak of my breaking point and my struggle. That was when everything needed to turn around for me, so I felt very determined to become stronger and face everything with all I had, which was hard when I was so demotivated to even get out of bed or eat. I was dying, really, very slowly and I can't even look at pictures of me anymore from that time because it looked like I was on deaths door and like nobody was home, like I was soulless. That shook me up because I spent most of my life at that point fighting tooth and nail to survive and overcome the bad situations I was in, I had so much fight and motivation but somewhere along the line I became so exhausted after escaping them that I just didn't care for myself anymore. For me it was about catching onto those tiny details, those tiny things you really love that can keep you going, they can be so small and insignificant but if they mean something to you then let it be so. 

I struggled with all of those feelings of unworthiness, that I felt like I was nothing, a failure, a disappointment, a burden but something clicked. I realised I was only worrying about how other people felt about me, how other people viewed my life and what is successful and it was the idea of other people's thoughts that kept me down. I opened myself up to the idea of my life being for me, and progress being on my terms, caring more about the life I want to live and how I personally wanted to live it. Everyone's motivations for getting better will be different, they don't have to be as self-centered as mine, everyone has different markers for what is successful, what is motivating, what is fulfilling so its important you make that distinction where ''what is success to YOU'' ''what is fulfilling to YOU'', trying to free your feelings on things from other people's ideas or perceptions first. Making sure that you know what you want, what makes you feel disciplined, makes you feel successful, makes you feel fulfilled, what makes you feel human.

There's stuff of mine people would consider completely stupid and not a marker of success or discipline at all because it came so naturally to them, they had normal upbringings were functional but to me one of my biggest successes and point of discipline is: being able to eat and feed myself so engaging with that is successful and disciplined for me even though its a normal human need or function. Like I said, its completely personal to me and I don't care what people think, if people think thats stupid or not a real marker for success or discipline or fulfillment to me it is one of the most important things I've done. But I've gone from being a husk in her bed to a human being who feels totally alive and I look alive.

For me I also feel fulfilled and successful helping people on Reddit, being able to leave little bits of hope or joy feels rewarding, things like that are success to me and monetary gain cannot compete with that feeling of fulfilment. Other points of discipline for me is doing my skincare everyday twice a day, writing creatively/engaging with creative hobbies, making my bed, waking up early every morning, eating when I feel hungry, tidying my room every week, drinking water (again, another one that sounds stupid but taking care of myself after years of not doing so is a big step of discipline for me and motivation). These are some daily examples of my version of discipline/what feels disciplined to me, and I've been able to do these things successfully everyday for years since I've gotten better from my conditions.

For me I find discipline and success in lots of little things and those little successes I can do everyday with ease builds up inside and keeps me motivated, but I also don't feel like a failure if I can't do them. I just know I've got all the time in the world to go at my pace and to try again another time. 

I know this sounds very like... fantasy and I know I sound very privileged, and I am and what I feel can be considered selfish or self-centered but nobody else has to be like me if they don't want to. Everyone's got their own ideas of worth, value, discipline, like I said, its about honing in on YOUR perception of those things and whats worth it to you than worrying about other people's values/what you should be. That is the biggest step you can make because often it is our worry of what people think of us/what others think of our value is what keeps us tied down and depressed, because we are being held down by other people's standards. They are often people who have not walked in our shoes, haven't shared our struggles or mindset. But yeah, I'm way more disciplined now that I am better, and my discipline/success/motivation is totally tailored to what I consider to be valuable and good for me.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,lhh2tsl,"Hi. I just wanted to check in with you and see how you are doing? I, too, have very bad depression. Just wanted to let you know that you’re not alone",1

Anxiety,16thenk,l3nuzow,Seriously thank you. I've been feeling like I'm losing my mind and memory after a bad mushroom trip for months now. This gives me hope.,3

Anxiety,16thenk,lgn9m1z,"Hi :) So not long after making this comment I actually started experiencing seizures, progressively got worse and was hospitalised. Long story short I was diagnosed with Epilepsy and I had inflammation in my brain causing the seizures and what I assume was the start of the dissociative episodes I was having and feeling terribly bad everyday. 

Made a lot of progress since being discharged though :) my anxiety is something I still struggle with massively but now I have an official diagnosis and neurologists looking after me I feel slightly more safer in myself! Thank you for reaching out and hope you are well in yourself too",8
Anxiety,16thenk,lbwz46j,Thank you so much for checking in. I was on a good path up until recently when my grandfather passed unexpectedly in May. My mental health is very challenging at the moment and there are days where I don’t even know who I am anymore. Im praying that I can get back on track soon but as of right now it’s hard to tell.,4
Anxiety,16thenk,lqokgkt,"Hey could you help me out too? I’m 19 and have had dp/dr for 5 years now, since I was 14. The thing is this all started from having panic attacks from weed twice. Ever since I was 14, I would have extreme anxiety almost every day. But now around the last year my anxiety has decreased so much to the point where I don’t even notice it anymore. I am still an anxious person and I may get some anxiety at times, but I can control it to the point where it goes away. How much longer will it take for the dp/dr to go away? I don’t even stress or feel bad anxiety like that anymore, I just wake up normally and fine, but I still feel dp/dr. I’d appreciate any help!",1
Anxiety,16thenk,lu7if0v,I’m still living with DPDR but not as intensely as when it first started. I’m on medication now that has lessened the severity of my symptoms. Just taking it a day at a time. Some days are easy and some days are hard but I wish everyday I could go back to normal.,3
Anxiety,16thenk,m2jok0x,"Still suffering a little bit but I’m on the road to recovery. I’m on an anti-seizure med called Trileptal, I don’t have seizures, but it doubles as a mood stabilizer. My Psych explained that the frontal lobes basically aren’t in sync anymore, and his hope is that this med will slow them down so that they get back in sync. It has helped, I was on 300mg, now 600mg. My DPDR, went from a 9/10. To like 3/4. He also prescribed an anxiety med, Diazepam, so when I feel an episode is coming on, I immediately take one and it basically halts it in its track. Mine began from taking a prescribed, increased dose of Zoloft all at once, and a blunt. I didn’t think to build up to the increased the dose, stupid on my part. I’ve been suffering since August, trying to find meds that work, and I finally have. Currently can’t drive due to the DPDR, but I think down my road of recovery with these meds I’ll be able to again. I couldn’t wear contacts before and now I’m finally able to. Just to add, I do believe that anxiety and fear play a huge part. I’ve been working on not being in my head anymore, and not being afraid during an episode. I always think I’m dying but I remember that I come out of it okay. It seems to help. That’s where this has one benefit for me, I’ve always struggled with over thinking and living in my head, and now it’s helping me not to and living in the real world.",3
Anxiety,16thenk,kasdpce,"Thank you for your well wishes. I appreciate some kindness specially at this time. You know I feel like my anxiety and depersonalization was induced by nicotine withdrawal. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal could mimic anxiety.but my symptoms lasted for a long time  5months+ now.

Last 15 days i have been feeling great almost back yo normal with some physical pain such as headache that comes and goes. I have never had 15 days without anxiety before at most it was about 9 or so but it always came back. Anyway I’ll keep you updated if it comes back but for now i feel good. I keep in mind all the things i learned from your posts and several others and to vent out about the last few months of struggle i keep a diary where i just write every thought i have whether it is a concern of some sort or an advice or realization I had. 

This is such a horrible thing to go through….sometimes I can’t comprehend. Cant believe just 5 months ago i was thinking about suicide. Im so much better now. Those thoughts may seem like nothing you do would be worth it. But there is so much more. You can get better..I just hope anyone who reads post like this knows that there is still hope left.",3
Anxiety,16thenk,k39eb8y,"Your words felt like a hug.I would surely try to implement these things little by little.Thank you for being here,thank you for sharing these kind words💓 I felt less alone.",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lhfw0a2,"Hello. Quick question - how did you handle the thought of no one understanding you or the fact that you really were trying so hard to better yourself? 

I feel like when I try to explain to my friends and family that I really am trying to do everything I can to snap out of it, they don’t believe me or just think I’m being “dramatic” (for lack of better terms). Therefore, I’ve just stopped talking about it with them 100%, which has brought me feelings of hostility and sadness towards them. 

Thanks so much for all your advice 🙏",1
Anxiety,16thenk,kvpsltm,"You're seeking out the facts more than validation so its okay! What's most important then, is you take my advice away with you and use it next time you're feeling afraid to help you rationalise your fear. Reassurance becomes harmful to OCD when you are constantly asking someone else for reassurance/validation, so the most important thing is if you've received an answer once: that should always be your answer and you don't need to ask for one again.

So I'm here to ease you and... I was just like you! I was keeping myself up at night terrified I'd hear things/see things, and I'd sometimes convince myself that I had even though I hadn't. I was pretty much sure I was developing it despite not having any signs/symptoms of it (just like you) but I kept myself completely on edge thinking I was on the cusp of developing it or a symptom was going to appear. I was terrified to look around because like you, I thought I was finally going to see something scary/not real. I had lots of vision symptoms which have now pretty much completely disappeared/faded into the background since I tried ignoring them instead of looking out for them. All your eye phenomena is 10000% normal and safe : )

**The fact you're self-aware immediately proves you're not schizophrenic or developing it**. Schizophrenia survives through lack of lucidity, you would lose your critical thinking skills and ability to be self-aware. So you wouldn't be able to question 'am I schizophrenic?' if you were developing it. Its mostly only ever caught, seen and diagnosed because of other people noticing it in someone else its very, very, very rare that a schizophrenic person manages a diagnosis through their own means. Its pretty much always only caught by friends/family members first. Schizophrenic people think they're being completely normal and are actually usually very calm, they wouldn't be questioning their symptoms at all/feeling afraid.

What's happening is: you are extremely anxious, you are hypervigilant right now, which is making you very on edge, making you feel very anxious, full of nervous energy and is making you susceptible to worrying about NORMAL body functions/phenomena. You're pretty much just jumpy, you may have things such as racing thoughts too, borderline 'paranoid' thoughts etc, you're ruminating on symptoms. This is all feeding into itself and is keeping your anxious cycle alive, so what can we do about that?

We fight it with rationality. So for example when you think you're developing schizophrenia (which is irrational) you combat it with a rational thought process. Use some of the points I was talking about!
''Well, I can't be schizophrenic because I'm self-aware'' ''none of my friends/family think I am schizophrenic'' ''I've never heard or seen anything!'' etc

What really helped me as well when I would tell myself these rational thoughts/facts is I would say it in a positive, humourous way. Like I could laugh at myself a bit (but kindly) and be like, ''Come on now you're just being silly. You're okay''. Being able to let loose, to laugh, to sigh, to see some humour in your struggle REALLY really helps, it helped me feel more human personally and let me know ''I'm okay and this will take time''.

You've got to be mega kind to yourself, and understand what you're going through and walk yourself through things rationally. You're not going to be perfect all the time, you're going to have those 'what if I am actually ___' 'oh no I'm scared again' but that's totally natural because we are never perfect first try at anything. I had those moments, too! But the more you accept the facts: you are just very anxious, you are traumatised from a bad experience you had, but you are safe/okay and you will heal etc the sooner you'll get better. 

Keep drilling that into yourself! Please feel free to ask me any more questions by the way, whether about your experience/if you want to ask more about mine : ) please keep in contact with me xxx",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lwqnlw0,"Hey, just wanted to check up on you because I'm in the exact same situation at the moment. I had a very bad first experience with weed a year ago ( when I was 17 ), and ever since I have developed intense DP/DR, which led me to believe that I was developing Schizophrenia or some other mental disorder that would ruin my life. Do you still have those symptoms?",1
Anxiety,16thenk,llcrinx,"It feels very weird not to have so many symptoms... I remember watching a movie the night before the morning I mentioned and all of a sudden (this was literally all at once) the captions felt more proportionally correct to the movie and the lighting in the room felt different. It was a little more realistic. Didn't think much of it until I woke up the next morning feeling so different, once again. Right now I still kind of have to ""click"" back into reality if I've been distracted for long, but it works, and it feels weird to be able to do because never have I ever been able to ""step out"" of dissociation like this before today. Being in a non or not-as-much dissociated state did feel weird first (because I had been permanently derealized and later depersonalized for over a year and I had literally forgotten how feeling real like an ordinary human even feels like). 

But I've noticed that confidence is so important. Not stressing about being stuck forever is so so so important. Because it breaks the loop. You absolutely have to believe that you can 100% recover no matter for how long you've been stuck. If you don't believe in that, I don't know if anything is gonna work for you. Confidence is absolutely the first step. 

I'm so sorry for writing this much lol I just felt like I had to share as many details as possible.",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lpbo2u1,"OP does say that your hormones take longer to adjust, so unless it's the first spike in 2 months after the last, yes it should be normal. 

For me, I still dissociate but it's easier for me to just ""turn it off"" by simply focusing on reality for no more than a second. Don't know when it'll actually fully stop and I don't still have to wake up with it by default.",2
Anxiety,16thenk,nfymor4,"No problem at all, it's now September (7 months since the shift in February) and still feeling good. I only really remember I had dpdr once a week or so now. (Purely because the experience itself was traumatic for me) But then I remember what ppl were saying when I was looking for help. Dpdr is just the mind protecting iitself. So as scary as it was it is a natural response to a very stressful event. 
I hope you and anyone else who reads this recovers soon. All the best 👍 ",1

It’s been a bit of a long one though, I was low in folic acid in November, then I had a brain MRI (came back normal) then spoke to a neurologist who diagnosed vestibular migraines and take Riboflavin (daily) and magnesium (nightly) religiously every day and just tested positive for coeliac disease so in the process of a diagnosis for that. 

I think a lot of vitamin deficiencies can cause havoc, have you been tested for any?",1

Do you think if i let's say fear falling asleep in the dark, i always have some kind of light on, do you think i should conquer that too and it would help fight general anxiety?  
Fuck i should right, and every trigger/fear should be conquered too

Like i have irrational thoughts when i try to fall asleep (sometimes) like if something is under my bed etc complete irrational bogus

It's just so hard...  
like right now im sitting at the mall, at work, im selling stuff, and im completely exposed to people and everything around is just blurry etc. And i try to keep in mind that it's just anxiety, but it's hard...

Anxiety,16thenk,kjo5dxf,"Yeah I fall into those bed ridden states and nobody gets it, I usually end up single when I'm going through those, and my parents are eastern european who believe mental health is just laziness. 

My thoughts pretty much loop around ""I can't"" I have such a negative view from depression that my mind just tries to find a solution but the I can't fix any of the problems loop shuts down every path. I can't get a job because they're high stress and I can't even interview because I've been isolated, and I can't even work or update my resume because I've lost all ethic, and even if I get a job I can't wake up at 7am and show up on time to work and be all cheerful, and even if I do show up at work on time, my mind is so messed up that I can't absorb any information so I'll just get fired before 3 months probation. So I just end up isolating and going crazy alone without a partner or support, and compulsively read reddit which feels like an OCD trying to find solutions, but when I find solutions like go to the gym, go volunteer, sign up for a class, be around people, go ask someone to review your resume or ask friends if anyone's hiring, ""I can't"" loop kicks back in. And even if I get a job it's usually like 1 year contract and then you're back on the street competing with 20 year olds who'll work harder and cheaper than me, with my trauma/mental health stuff/laziness/adhd.

So it's my self limiting beliefs I can change, that just pin me down thinking I'll be like this forever and I'm too incapacitated to even kill myself and this will never end. Despite me getting jobs in the past, but then being lonely anyway and directionless in life even with a job that takes care of the bills I'm still unhappy. Which is maybe my biggest problem, not having anything to work towards and I don't know if it's anxiety or ADHD but any feeling of unease makes me escape into compulsive googling or pleasure seeking distractions, so it's like I've got no emotional self control/grit, so can't even go back to school or do 1 hour of solid work if someone held a gun to my head. And no medication is going to fix it or therapy, I have to actually do it myself, which I find impossible when I believe I'm unfixable. 

I think if you can logic/rationalize argue with yourself you're in a decent place to fix yourself, but my anxiety runs on emotion so much it's hard to pull in the rational/factual brain to interrupt/reprogram.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,kjvujvp,"Thanks for sharing, yeah I feel you on your points about societal expectations, my self worth is tied to my job which is unstable and not long term feasible with my mental health and being older but still having to go crawl back to my parents when I crumble who don't get it and tell me to go work at wall mart after making 6 figure for 5 years, and falling into deep loneliness and helplessness and despair of having to make money on this world v and take care of myself and my aging parents, makes me feel hopeless about being able to recover second time on a tight deadline. I appreciate you sharing your story, I never lived the life I figured out or wanted just what was expected of me,  leading to no self identity besides work, and it is killing me knowing I have to do that for the rest of my life unless I have a major perspective and personality shift. No job, break up after 6 years, and the hole is pulling me in again, not sure I have the time or resources to crawl out a second time. Or any strength left. Husk of myself again like you described.

Anxiety,16thenk,l4bxzgn,"My DPDR was:

- Wooziness
- Dizziness
- Altered perceptions of reality (like my limbs felt they were either too big or too small, the world felt flat/2D, objects felt closer or farther away, things were taller or smaller, my senses such as touch were dull, everything appeared very bright, increased feelings of nostalgia, people didn't feel human to me)
- Feelings of unrealness or like I was in a dream
- Feelings of dread, overwhelming anxiety
- Felt like I'd fall through any surface I'd stand on, like any second I could just float away or fall through the earth
- When I'd close my eyes to sleep it felt like the atmosphere was moving/I was moving around or floating
- I felt completely detached from myself, like I was watching life through a TV screen
- Looking in the mirror felt unfamiliar and scary
- Nothing brought me joy, I felt scared because I felt so detached and I couldn't enjoy anything I did",3
Anxiety,16thenk,mizqmzk,"Hi, and thank you for answering. No, I haven't been tested for anything yet, I tried to ""walk it off"" the first month, and it did get ""tolerable"" in the sense that while under extreme discomfort I could still function somewhat normally, just that a few days maybe a week ago the visual part got a little better but the anxiety skyrocketed to the point where I felt like  i couldn't breath and lost my internal monologue for a few minutes, that made the visual ""I feel like a dream"" effect to come back quite strong although not full force. I finally explained all this to my mother, and she's been super supportive and scheduled me with a psychologist and had my first appointment 2 days ago.

Right now when am in my room or in places with natural lightning I feel much better, not 100% out, but like 80-90%, however in artificially lit places, like a classroom, a restroom or a gym it just comes back a loooot stronger along with anxiety and fatalyst thoughts but as soon as i get back outside or in my room it goes back to being 80% gone.

I don't know if this might be a sign of it going away, so I wanted to know a bit more details about your whole experience if that's OK with you.
 Thank you in advance 

it's worth saying that I just turned 19, live half the world away from my family, and that my mom, who's always been my greatest friend and support, is going through breast cancer treatment, she is expected to be ok and the surgery is scheduled for may, but I've always been quite anxious so am planning to go and visit my home for a month and then come back.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,mj4rits,"Hey, sorry to reply again, how long did you had it for? because i see the first comment was 2 months ago and you said something about low folic acid in November in the first reply, am being told to not worry to much about how long it will take but am curious anyways",1

Anxiety,16thenk,l1j8zvy,"Yes, absolutely all of these. I'd have brain fog (which made me need to take a longer time to process things), I felt completely emotionally numb (this is because you feel so detached from what you're experiencing/yourself when you're in high-stress and high anxiety)

And yes, vision impairments. All of these have gone since I recovered : )",2
Anxiety,16thenk,l1j8o86,"Symptoms would get milder, after a while though I totally forget to check for symptoms so at some point for me they stopped completely and I just didn't take notice/realise. I just felt totally normal.

Anxiety,16thenk,lpj0pbp,"Whenever you feel this way drive past your old house it will help trust me, being in familiar places wil help or looking at pictures",2
Anxiety,16thenk,ljuwlvq,"For me, it was caused by a singular panic attack that I misread at the time, as being something worse (like I was dying or like I was sick). 

After that, I was in a constant state of panic which drove things such as my adrenaline and cortisol really high. When these hormones get really high and stay at a high-level for a long time, you will experience strange symptoms, one of which is DPDR. 

I was filled with panic and anxiety 24/7, every single day due to overthinking about what happened, thinking I was becoming really sick and I failed to realise it was just a panic attack until a long time later. Once I finally managed to become rational again and get control of my anxiety, my DPDR went away over a period of just a few months after having DPDR 24/7 for over a year",2
Anxiety,16thenk,msfb2c6,"I am, yes! I have been for years now",1
Anxiety,16thenk,ke61r89,"Yes you can! I occasionally drink alcohol and I've been absolutely fine since I got better, even if I drink a lot in a singular go.

I just don't recommend doing it a lot even when you're better as post-drinking anxiety spikes are very real and annoying. Not dangerous at all, just annoying! But yeah once you're completely better you can absolutely have it again, that's because you'll be at a normal hormonal baseline and drinking alcohol won't spike it up too high that it'll put you in a bad place again.

Its just when you're in a bad place hormonally (such as high hormones) and having another thing that increases hormones is basically adding to it, making it even higher when its already unbearable. But it won't be unbearable to go 'up' a tiny bit in hormones once you've fully started to relax/got back down : ) if that makes any sense lmao",3
Anxiety,16thenk,lhhcbg7,"My Agoraphobia was pretty bad, it developed very acutely (suddenly) following a panic attack I had randomly in public around November 2019. 

After that panic attack, anytime I went outside I was having overwhelming feelings of dread, non-stop panic attacks, I'd start to publicly freak out. I ran out of a restaurant because I felt so terrified and anxious and confused, and broke down onto the floor outside. I eventually stopped going outside completely, isolating myself in my home, I couldn't even walk a few steps outside my house without breaking down into sheer panic.

I had Agoraphobia from November 2019 until about June 2020, so not very long in the grand scheme (and honestly quite a strange time as this was during COVID lockdowns). I went through an exposure/talking therapy through the NHS for it via the phone, and I had a woman who helped me set realistic weekly goals towards going back outside, as well as being my emotional support and moral support. With her help and encouragement I managed to combat Agoraphobia very quickly starting in March 2020 to June 2020. 

Agoraphobia is less about being terrified of people, and is more based on cyclical anxiety. An example of it using my story: 

- Have a random panic attack outside
- Become worried about going outside in case you panic
- Go outside again, have a panic attack
- Start thinking ""every time I go outside I'm going to have a panic attack""
- Start getting scared of going outside because you know you're going to have a panic attack
- Start to isolate yourself because you know you'll have a panic attack if you go outside
- Stuck at home unable to leave because you're dreading the inevitable panic

And with that, you get stuck in an anxious loop which is what Agoraphobia actually is! When you're Agoraphobic, you not only fear panicking in public (whether out of embarrassment or the symptoms feeling scary) but you fear the lack of ability to escape or ability to get to a safe place. Which is why people tend to isolate in the home, too as that feels like a safe place. This can translate or be seen as a fear of people or being in public, as being anxious/panicking around people is incredibly vulnerable and embarrassing. But the truth is, Agoraphobic are anxious of being anxious, and want to be somewhere they feel safe to panic if it happens.

I hope this makes sense!? If you have anymore questions please do ask.

Conquering Agoraphobia and learning about cyclical anxiety very quickly taught me tools and skills to combat any and all forms of Anxiety for me, and greatly improved my mental health. I was able to recover from DPDR and long-term anxiety (which I'm still healed from!) with the skills and techniques I learned from my time with Agoraphobia",1

Anxiety,16thenk,mj566eu,"Sorry to hear all that, I think it took around 3 months but I still get overstimulated about it now and I still have moments where I’m panicky and on edge so realistically I’m not back to the way I was prior to it all but I’m also going through the diagnosis of coeliac too. I think it’s worth getting all your vitamins checked in a blood test as being low in iron (which I was slightly) for example can cause you to feel very disconnected from life. 

I couldn’t leave the house at one point and I just had to get on with it and the more you get on with it, it slowly starts to get better. Everything was blurry for me as well and that gradually got better each day but I also have been taking a load of vitamins so hard to know whether it was anxiety or that.

Therapy did help though and they do give you tips on how to cope (my therapist did here anyway - I ended up going private but did help massively). 

But yeah I’d say about 3 months to finally feel a little bit like myself again but the best thing I did was to stop reading about DPDR and stop googling! It really stops you from getting better trust me, I read all the reddit stories, watched all the tik toks and it just stopped me from progressing.",1
Anxiety,16thenk,mj56njt,"I know how difficult it is though, I get a knot in my stomach thinking about 2 months ago and I practice deep breathing to get through it. It’s tough even regardless of having a good support network. I’d definitely look into therapy if you think it’s tied to a trauma or ongoing stress like you mentioned. Really hope you get better soon, it’s horrific and wouldn’t wish it on anyone! Its difficult when you see everyone else moving on with their lives and it feels like you’re falling behind. 

I was very depressed and anxious and glad persisted and told myself I’d get better because you really do!",1

Anxiety,16thenk,m13k3a7,"Have you had any constant sources of stress? If not, you might have started disconnecting because of something and then continued feeding into the depersonalization and accepted it. I know a bit about dpdr, it would happen when i would severly stress myself out about questioning if my family were real people or not, and how the world could end at any second. Scary. It was awful, but as long as i keep those thoughts out and remind myself i am in control, it gets better. It really is a defense mechanism at its core i think. Just last night i almost lost my shit because i was drunk and we were all hiding from my gf. I chose to go in a pitch black room and i felt myself slipping. I didnt let it freak me out, tho, because when i stress about it, it gets exponentially worse. I just accepted it, and told myself it will all be okay no matter what, and it left me alone",1

So its safe to say, those 3 things you said, are absolutely the cause of yours. Even if you can't figure out which particular situation it was that triggered it, what is important and will help you get better, is acknowledging that those 3 things (trauma, anxiety and stress) is what keeps DPDR alive and kicking. 

Its about tackling those issues, and reducing those stressors.",1

Anxiety,16thenk,mj5ajys,"Just remember it’s not dangerous and it’s there to protect you, the post we’re commenting on actually helped me massively and was the last post I read before I cut off reading any others. 

I had it 24/7 with no break and could barely see a thing I had quite a lot of visual snow but there were other times where everything was too much like what I was seeing was very overstimulating and “too clear” if that makes sense - there was never an in between! 

I’m still not 100%, I don’t like going anywhere alone because I get dizzy (I was diagnosed by a neurologist with vestibular migraines). Just an FYI, I had the same symptoms you did and had a brain mri and it was normal. 

I get moments for sure where things look off and I think a lot of it is BRAIN FOG and then I know I need to rest and distract myself - do a puzzle or I crochet sometimes too. 

I spent 2 days a week ago panicky 24/7 and was worried I’d go back into it but it’s because of your adrenaline, the best thing to do when panicky and on edge is deep breathing, very niche but it works.

Oh yeah, one thing I can’t do right now is drive very far. I can drive locally but if I need to go far I get the train (which I do by myself to visit my partner). But I’m hopeful after diagnosis, the brain fog and lack of concentration will improve and I’ll be able to again. It gets better and your brain CAN rewire. 
I take magnesium every night recommended by the neurologist if that helps, it helps with anxiety and helps you sleep. 

I just want to add I was given antidepressants twice which I took for 2 days and stopped so everything I’ve done is natural alongside therapy. Despite this, my if you think antidepressants may help, there’s no shame in it at all, some people get along with them, I just didn’t. I hope this helps!",1

If so, no. That is just someone who is completely misguided on why their DPDR appeared. She 100% likely had stress, anxiety or trauma, and considering she thought she went insane I'm inclined to believe she had health anxiety which is a super common form of cyclical anxiety.

They more than likely encountered a traumatic, stressful or anxious event that they are refusing to acknowledge or they may have mental health issues such as religious psychosis that makes them believe those things. Religious psychosis also a very real mental health issue which causes people to believe in things such as 'awakenings' and things that aren't based in reality. They typically develop DP and (or) DR as well as a lot of other troubling symptoms.

Also it is incredibly, incredibly rare to experience DP without having DR. In the huge majority of cases they are combined, but even when separated they are also both individually only able to be triggered by stress, trauma or anxiety. Nothing else.

Also both DP and DR are just as bad as each-other, every mental health symptom should be considered on an equal plain as one another. None is worse than the other, they are all just the same level of bad.",2

try NOCD to get therapy. im doing it and its helping. im so srs go get that help and therapy. itll make u feel better and more proactive. also i would suggest vitamins and a probiotic. all my IBS issues went away when i slept better and took those (also make a primary care for ur stomach pains so u can talk through them in a location besides the emergency room, and get blood panels done and have a dcotor tell u whats going on - not google). 

we can do this, this feeling wont last forever. but if you get therapies, meditations (DARE app is good), reading books/podcasts about your anxiety and getting medical help thats not the ER or google can help. and i mean like a primary care to inform you of things and maybe a psychiatrist for medication. thats what i do anyways rn. cuz i also envision scary scenarios and my family grieving and its been so tough, but im holding out faith that i can get past it. i just currently hate all this discomfort im in (im sure ur also worn out)",1

My therapist 10 years ago (honestly the best one I’ve had, only reason I’m not still seeing her was because it was through my university so couldn’t after I graduated) had rheumatoid arthritis, shared that with me and it helped put a lot in perspective when I was worrying about a certain chronic illness back then, that despite it she was still able to carry on in her life.",2

It was not good. It was treatment resistant. Id already struggled with cptsd and a multitude of other diagnosis. When the pandemic hit I was already at all all time low.

I went to a fuck ton of therapy. I became spiritual. Not in a Christian way (fuck that abusive ass toxic narcissistic religion). In a reclaiming my relationship with the mother earth and myself and the universe kinda way. A little woowoo witchyness. I give myself grace. I do shadow work. I do ancestor work. I got on medication, then got off all of it. I stopped looking for a diagnosis to fix me. I went to therapy and came back angrier. I focus on what I can control. I take it day by day. I practice mindfulness. I notice and take note when something good happens and soak up the glow of happiness while it lasts. I learned to accept the anger that was lying underneath the anxiety as justified. I embrace the shadow and the light. Balance. I find bits of advice from the ancients. Buddhism. Philosophers. Wisdom from my grandmothers and old wives tales. Practical and ancient Wisdom from every country I can find. Mash it all together to make some sense of what we all share together. study history to see the patterns, that humans have survived so much and will survive so much more and than even if we don't, the universe will still turn and since i, we all are part of it, born of stardust and returned to stardust when we die. Nothing makes sense and everything makes sense. We are all One Being shattered into 10 billion pieces to learn 10 billion lessons.

Personally, water helps me a lot, whether it's just splashing a little water on my face or taking a full shower.


An example is that there's a TikTok account in Spanish (my native language) that reports on many worrying cases, but they themselves know this, so they make casual videos of good news in these complicated times.

What’s helped me is to basically pick a few issues I’m passionate about and only consume news related to those. I’m sure many people would see this as being purposefully uninformed, but honestly people have only so much mental energy to care about so many things at once. Plus, narrowing your focus allows you to actually participate in those causes. 

For example, women’s healthcare and LGBTQ issues are extremely important to me. I follow news updates closely and donate hundreds of dollars a year to good causes. In my mind, hundreds of dollars to one org is more valuable than one dollar to one hundred orgs. I also follow more positive accounts of related organizations. It’s refreshing to read stories with happy endings and see positive changes and outcomes.

Anxiety,1kszek5,muo8xch,"US news is designed to be divisive. If it was unified, it could be used as a propaganda piece for the government. It also would be less profitable since news today is tailored to their audience. People watch news they want to hear, not what they need to. For example...if you are on the left you want to hear Donald Trump is going to jail or Kamala will will win election easily. They tailor and sell you that news...you buy it. It ends up being untrue. You get angry and start to question so called 'media'. Anxiety builds because you don't know what is going on, then that same media tries to instill fear to keep you watching. 


The best thing I've done is put it down for a second. Especially corporate media. These are literally arms of each political party. Realize there are at least two sides (thank goodness) of the isle. And if you are watching only one side understand you are risking being manipulated.


However, if you are able to understand both sides and engage, you might see through some of the BS and are less likely to be blindsided. I have found you can do this by watching independent media in which the other side is invited on for debate. In this way you can still be informed but watch both sides duke it out civilly and on the record. Then you decide and ultimately vote during our election cycles.


As for your anxiety, turn it off completely for a while...I have found ultimately politics has no impact on my life whatsoever other than people getting riled up over it. Regardless of our political beliefs I have found I have more in common with other Americans than differences. Respecting those differences on a foundation of commonality is critical. Not everyone will agree with you, but that's ok. But if you choose to engage, it can be healthy if we know how to talk to one another, share ideas, agree to disagree, know when to walk away from topics that are too hot, or when to just hug it out and just be cool again. No need to be rude or upset! Sometimes you may have to say sorry or forgive others but it is worth it to build your character. This takes time and practice and getting to know others that you may not totally agree with, but does not mean you can't like them, learn from them and get to know more about yourself. Heck, you may even learn to like yourself and start to love others if you are able to navigate through all that successfully. That is the ultimate unification. Best of luck to you. ",1

Our Founders knew that throughout history, evil men with dangerous ideas had ruled over humanity. So, they lit a fire — an unquenchable flame of liberty — and built a system to protect it. A system where you can speak your mind, challenge injustice, and stand before a court without fear of the sword or the dungeon.

They handed you the blueprint of freedom — not as a relic to admire, but as a weapon to defend and a gift to share with the world.

But hear this truth: Freedom is always one generation away from extinction. It is not inherited through blood. It must be fought for, protected, and passed on. If we fail, then one day we will sit in our twilight years, telling our children and our children’s children the sorrowful tale of what it was once like… when men and women in America walked the earth as free people.

The torch is in your hands now. Don’t let it go out.",1

I can't talk to them about any of this. They will tell me I deserve it. I have tried to not read the news every morning because I admit it...I don't want to know anymore!!!! Politics has even entered my crafting area. There was a huge issue going on this week where someone posted a list of companies to boycott. Can't we agree to disagree? Do we have to resort to anger, cruelty and violence? My parents were on opposite political parties and they were married for almost 50 years. They fought about a LOT of things but politics was not one of them.

For anyone that opens our comment thread:

It's hard, and anxiety lies to you just as much as those that are polluting, wage thefting, media-tainment-ing (reddit being a part of that), data thefting, resource hordeing. 

It was bread and circuses before, the boob tube before, it's the doom scroll now. People have to be tricked into letting go of their power, propaganda to create racism and uphold it, fear and insecurity to enforce classes and capitalism to consume it- yes your pain is sold back to you, think about it for a second. What's your comfort,how do you shut off your brain with books, TV movies, alcohol you gotta break the government seal on to sip, weed? I'm not saying avoid rest. I'm saying those things aren't rest. And their restorative abilities are limited compared to their usage/abuse.

We cannot do it all, but we all can do something. 
And let it be imperfect. 

We are not helpless. We are made of star stuff and have evolved to depend on each other, be inconvenienced by each other, need and be needed. 

That is our power against the greedy and the corrupt.

Anxiety,1ggeaby,lup2963,"The way this works is, anxiety is from having low tolerance of uncertainty. When this tolerance is very low, you won't be able to trust your own mind.

My hair fell out, I lost 60 lbs and developed chronic vomiting, my body is suffering because I was convinced I was being a baby and could just push through it. Ive been home for 10 days now, starting IOP this week. I hope you took the leave and healed your brain and heart. You deserve it.",3

Anxiety,1exe482,n3vehas,"Appreciate hearing your story. I'm working up the courage to apply for FMLA right now. I have ptsd, depression and anxiety and I've been overwhelmed with figuring out what to do. 

How much notice am I supposed to provide? Like ideally they want 60 days for FMLA. Should I try for short term disability? Should I do intermittent or start with continuous first and see? How much time should I take? How to share with my boss and even the ridiculous part of worrying what co-workers may think about me being gone for awhile. I've finally opened up to the idea of an IOP too.",1
Anxiety,1exe482,lj5hfvw,I have the forms I need but there’s a section on the form that asks for the start date of my leave and I don’t have a start date since I don’t know when I might need it and I know this coworker has applied for intermittent FMLA before so I wanted to ask her what she put there. I’m afraid I’ll make an error on the form and then have problems later on because of that.,2
Anxiety,1exe482,mwp5kp8,"I did end up getting the help I needed to apply for FMLA and I didn’t have to disclose the reason and they didn’t pry. It was originally intermittent leave, but then I ended up having to reapply for extended leave while I did IOP after an attempt and it was extremely helpful. At that point, I did disclose the reason to a couple close coworkers and they were extremely supportive and it made me feel a lot less alone. I’ve now been back at work for a couple months and I feel like I’m doing better than ever so I’m really glad I took the time to heal and I hope this break continues to be positive for you.",2
Anxiety,1exe482,n3zzi3d,"If you feel like you need a break urgently and wanna do IOP, don’t worry about 60 days notice. They will figure it out. When I decided to do IOP I literally gave two days notice and I didn’t tell my boss what was going on at all, I just said that I would need to be hospitalized for a couple weeks and so she urged HR to sort out the paperwork quickly.

I don’t think you have schizophrenia. I think your like me where you start thinking things and your so fixated on it and it freaks you out more.  It’s like a spiral.

Anxiety,17nu7jv,k7u2psf,"Oh for real. But not suppressed. I spent the last 10 years or so in therapy for family of origin stuff. The lady diagnosed me with CPTSD. But the therapy went so well, I had no more anxiety over it. I felt cured you know. I used to be this anxious mess.

But I do admit, that I had bad flashback dreams of my emotionally abusive dad before those panic attacks came in. Super weird you should mention it. He was laughing at me for quitting smoking of all things - saying I’m just pretending and not a good person (his favourite line).

Edit: I’m also super drawn to these family topics emotionally lately. Often crying about some aspect of my childhood that I rediscover in my memory. Super emotional and filled with love for my child self in the last couple of weeks.

 Turns out I was feeling safe and trusted someone for the first time in my life, and I was stable so now the floodgates are open. I was strangled by my spouse a couple months ago, but he was triggered and probably has DID so he doesn't remember. My csa involved choking as a toddler.

I check in to see if there’s anything pressing, but go back to my own real life afterward. Becoming a news junkie is a real thing, just like any other addiction. I create my own positivity and rarely does that involve anything from the news of the day.

You got this 💪",1
Anxiety,1hfd7q6,m2atcej,I am not addicted to news but somehow there are some posts which comes in my feed,1
Anxiety,1hfd7q6,m2bk1mo,Yeah I hear you but it’s all planned out. I mean we call it a “feed” haha. It’s all about what we consume. What we focus on grows.,1
Anxiety,1h0pthd,lz5nkzx,"Just text my boss and say im not feeling well and won't be in. You don't have to say why you are not feeling well and they can't ask. I usually just get a ""Feel better soon"" response.",2
Anxiety,1h0pthd,lz5otml,"When I call in sick to work for any reason, I say “I am not well enough to come to work today.” I don’t give them any details about why I am unwell, because that is my private health information and not any of their business.",2
Anxiety,1h8bfxd,m0rycfv,Yoga doesn’t help me with my anxiety but my anxiety is extreme and I find it very hard to stay still and grounded.,1
Anxiety,1h8bfxd,m0scqns,"yoga uses the same mechanism as a massage, mainly by using your muscles which create a relaxing effect. anything more is a esoteric belief.",1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,l2d904y,"it's very common for antibiotics to cause issues like stomach pain and acid reflux as they deplete the bacteria in your gut. it's extremely unlikely it's a serious condition, and getting some probiotic milk or yoghurt should immediately help the stomach issues. antibiotics can also cause dehydration and a very dry mouth, and then in turn the dehydration can cause headaches, which can cause your ears to ring, again it's very common. your anxiety is completely understandable, i have a lot of health anxiety too, but it could also be worsening the headaches (and again the ears). just know that it can take a couple weeks for your gut to heal back to normal, but it will happen, genuinely. 
i know you said you're having a plain diet, it might be worth doing the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast) just to give your stomach some time to settle?
i'm sorry your doctor is being very dismissive, i know that must make this so much more frustrating and scary. i'm confident you'll feel normal again soon though, try not to google your symptoms.",2
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,l5qtq87,"How are you now? 

I took antibiotics around 6/7 weeks ago for tonsillitis, they made me incredibly unwell with severe nausea, stomach upset, stomach ache, loss of appetite and feeling generally weak and unwell. I wish I’d never taken them.

I’d hoped the side effects would disappear after I’d finished the course but I’ve been incredibly unwell since. I have no appetite, severe nausea, I’m losing weight. I’m terrified. I’ve had bloods done along with bloods for autoimmune disorders I’m waiting on my results. I’ve been in bed for weeks, I already have severe anxiety and agoraphobia so it’s made it 100x worse 
I feel like I’m never going to be able to eat properly again or get better. 

Did you get any answers from your tests?",1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,lnp1832,How are things now? I took two - 5 day long antibiotics back to back in January of this year and I’m still suffering from the worst anxiety ever (it’s definitely gotten better but it’s still not back to what it was- livable lol),1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,m3r2jsn,How are you doing now? Similar thing is happening to me from doxy...,1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,l2daiya,"Thank you so much for your response! It gave me a little hope. 

Im really praying that my body will recover from this. I made the mistake of googling already and read many horror stories where people ended up having permanent damage from antibiotics. I'm now trying my best to believe that this is not me and things will resolve themselves.

Right not im trying to reach at least 2000 calories in a day, for many days I was only able to eat about 1000-1400. I'm also taking vitamins and probiotic supplements. Some foods seem to trigger issues at night so right now im sticking to mainly oats, apples, white rice, plain chicken breast, ham and cucumbers. At this point im afraid to eat wheat and unfortunately I'm allergic to bananas. It's possible that stress plays a large role in these reactions. My focus is almost always on the symptoms which is probably making everything worse.",2
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,l5r7f9r,"Well, im still kind of dealing with it. I've found out that I have high lymphocites (from bacteria or virus) from my blood test, it has dropped down a bit but its still above normal. Besides that I've found out that part of my suffering is from my allergies flaring up (pollen and ragweed), which is probably from the gut issues because the last time I had severe allergies was about 18 years ago.

Good news is that my blood otherwise looks healthy, tumor marker is fine. I've been put on 40mg of famotidine every day and it has helped with the stomach tension, throat pain and post nasal drip. Despite never feeling hungry, im able to eat enough to meet my calorie requirements, although im still on a plain diet.

I still have symptoms like tension in the upper stomach area, dryness between fingers, occasional shortness of breath, lump in throat feeling and constant burping but its more tolerable now. Looking back the severe dryness and tingling were probably caused by my allergy flare up and anxiety, I still get the tingling sometimes but I don't really worry about it as much. I'm 100% sure my problem is gut related, im still in the process of figuring it out. Im going to keep asking for tests until I find the answer, meanwhile im doing my best to manage it and allow my body to heal. Im making sure I eat and sleep enough and I take vitamins + probiotics every day.

I wish you the best man, I hope we will both get our lives back.",1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,m59cxmm,Did it go away?,1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,lnppf96,"I'm feeling a lot better since. Eventually I processed whats going and decided that I needed to stop freaking out.  What helped with that is that I felt like I had nothing to lose, so I might as well try it.

I decided to try allowing the symptoms to manifest instead of worrying about them. Eventually the tingling has lessened a lot. This gave me an answer about the tingling, I knew that symptom was controlled by the anxiety. Altough I did have a bunch of other symptoms still.

I figured I needed to focus on restoring my eating and sleeping. It was extremely difficult at the beginning, but I was feeling better little by little. I was eating a very plain diet for long, just focusing learning how to eat more again. Turns out a lot of my symptoms were due to allergies, both seasonal and food. At first I was taking a histamine blocker called Pepcid, then I moved on to Allegra, these helped alot. I also had many tests done that ruled out things that could be wrong. (The only positive test was the allergy) This also helped with my worries.

In the present day I feel like I got my life back, although im not eating spicy foods to be safe; I still have allergies, even in september which I never had in the past but Allegra is helping with that.

Its hard to recall the beginning of it, since its kind of behind me already. I know how hopeless it feels when you are in the deepest part of it. I hope I can help with this. I'm wishing you the best!",1
Anxiety,1cj2gvs,m3r95t8,"Im doing much better nowadays, there are still occasional reflux issues but I can eat basically anything. Besides that most of the symptoms are gone. It turned out many of my symptoms where allergy / histamine intolerance related (not exactly sure which one). This year I’ve been much more sensitive to pollens and certain foods.


The things that helped me:

-Going to doctors to get everything checked and rule out possible causes

-Taking allegra for allergies and changing my sheets regularly, cleaning my room and using an air purifier.

-Getting my stomach used to food again. First I was doing low FODMAP and focused on eating more and more every day, but making sure it won’t cause too much reflux, then I later on I increased my palette.

-Taking an anticid temporarily (famotidine) to help with reflux and sleeping.

-One very important one was my mindset which eventually changed from gaining confidence. This came from taking control of the situation and slowly getting better and better. Accepting that I was feeling certain symptoms and learning to live with them was a huge change.


It took a few months before I was really able to live life again, but now I can eat anything, even spicy foods, I can drink alcohol, I have energy, I can sleep well I’m able to work out and I’m no longer stuck inside the house. I still have occasional reflux and I suspect that I will have to take Allegra again from next year April but its not a huge deal.

Anxiety,1cj2gvs,l2ejxih,"no worries, i just have a lot of personal experience haha, my younger sister has ear infections so frequently and is on antibiotics a lot and she deals with everything mentioned above, but she's always okay in the end. 

upping your calories will definitely help you recover faster, all the foods you're eating will help :) 
just try and remind yourself it's temporary, i know you said it's been around 10 days which to me means you're near the end!",1

Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqjbrv,My SO finally told me about the depth of his anxiety. I can now notice the signs of him becoming unwell and can help him get help. Im so glad he told me. His anxiety doesnt define him and it doesn't change how much I love him.   I'm sure your SO feels the same!,25
Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqccu5,This was the moment for me. Two years ago I knew my gf was shopping in the area and I was having an anxiety day so I asked her to stop by on my break.

Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqti2h,"My girlfriend has anxiety and depression (I have anxiety too) and I love her so much. It’s taken time for me to understand what she’s going through but now I recognize signs of her bad days and do what I can to support her even from long distance. Sometimes that means just giving her space and other times it means sending her a pizza after a hard week. 

It means being the strong one sometimes, and it means being patient. But she is the most incredibly resilient and kind and beautiful person I have ever met and I feel so lucky to love and know her. Mental health issues are so hard and only you can truly know what you’re going through but the right person will be there with you every step of the way and will try to understand as much as they can. 

I always tell her I can’t fix the bad things and I can’t make them go away, but I can add something good to her life and be something positive. I hope your SO is supportive and patient with you and a good thing in your life no matter what. ",7

Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqd5rm,"surely he/she would have known, but its always great to be able to be honest about how you feel. ",2
Anxiety,84j9uz,dvsfyvk,"Sorry. A lot of young people (mostly young men) do think of a relationship partner as someone to share an emotional or otherwise psychological burden with, but that’s something that develops over time and should be unrelated to the sexual/romantic nature of your relationship. People assigned male at birth should be taught to be more supportive emotionally. young men become so fragile and so dependent upon women for validation and psychological care because of a gender script which disallows friendship based upon mutual dependence and emotional support, they then seek that through romantic partnership, as women are more suited to this kind of friendship (due to their gender script) and non sexual relationships with women are also strictly forbidden for young men. As a result we have dysfunctional families and friendships. ",2

Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqtvhp,"I don’t know if this is the best advice. There’s a lot of misunderstanding about mental illness, even among otherwise conscientious and patient people. I’m not saying you should enter a long term relationship without intending to tell your partner about those issues, but it’s important to find the right time and way to share this. The early stages of a relationship are usually about having fun but being mostly independent of each other’. If you have no one else to go to and you’re having a really hard time consider a therapist unless you’re certain your partner is capable of supporting you through and accepting your anxiety. If you never get to that point after a long while, you may as well risk it or end the relationship yourself, but starting your relationship by attempting to share your own burdens with someone is often not the best way (in most circumstances) and can be pretty inconsiderate to those people.",1
Anxiety,84j9uz,dvqn29m,"Wow, I struggle with ADHD and depression as well. Sometimes I feel that there are so many things wrong with me at once... like, it would somehow be better and more acceptable if I had merely one of those issues as opposed to all three (anxiety, depression, and ADHD).",5

Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwai7di,"My therapist would say we can’t actually control the anxiety and these thoughts, we can only control how we react to them. 

For a long time I had anxiety about having anxiety. I was really hard on myself for not being able to ‘control it’. I also have health anxiety (in my mid 30s) and I’m having much different physical symptoms now than I ever did before. Shortness of breath, chest and heart scares, etc. 

What has helped me is to accept that I have health anxiety, and act accordingly. I educated myself on the physical symptoms of anxiety so that I’m better prepared to challenge my fears. When I get scared because of a feeling in my chest, I can now confidently accept that my fight or flight has been activated for some reason, (which doesn’t require a conscious reason). 

Ultimately, rather than seeking to stop the thoughts, it might be more helpful to accept the thoughts, and practice coping with them. Mine have stopped happening as often now that I’ve  accepted having them. Therapy was a great tool for me to simply better understand how to identify cognitive distortions and work through the anxiety when it happens. 

Good luck!!",14

As obvious it was nothing I apologized for wasting his time. He grabbed my shoulders and said you will never waste my time. I would rather have you come in then worrying yourself like crazy. My doctor visits went from 3 times a week to once a month to even once every 3 months just for prescription medication.  If i had something again that i was worried about he would examine me from top to bottom and say i had nothing to worry about and explain why I didn’t have to worry.

Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwdto2s,"Firstly wanna say, if it’s intrusive and impulsive thoughts that are eating you alive, 0.5mg Risperdal taken at night will sort that out in no time. It’s worth talking to your doc to try out. 


I am not a doctor, please do your own research or consult a medical professional if need be, below is my own anecdotal support system I have built to help myself and my wife maintain. We both came off Wellbutrin at the same time and the darkest depression and anxiety ensued while we were withdrawing. Below is what I studied and actioned to get us out of bed and back to the realm of the living. Within 24-48 hrs we were human again. 

Pro tip, for anxiety it helps to drink decaf coffee or stop consuming caffeine altogether. 


Do some research and if you can, look into taking an amino acid stack of L-Tyrosine, L-Theanine, 5-HTP, CoQ10 and Vitamin B Complex. 

L-Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid and is a precursor that converts to Dopamine and noradrenaline. 5-HTP is a precursor that converts to Serotonin and Melatonin. Valuable neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating your brain. 

You want to be dosing the L-Tyrosine and 5-HTP at a ratio of either 10:1 or 5:1 (depending on whether you stand to benefit from a bias in the supported availability of Serotonin/Melatonin or Catecholamines (Dopamine, noradrenaline etc.) NB you shouldn’t supplement one without the other. Please research this if you’re curious as to why. TLDR they’re metabolised by the same enzyme so supplementing only one without the other will cause an imbalance and lead to you feeling horrid again. I know this because I went on and off 5-HTP several times in my life and every time it would be really helpful and then I’d feel horrendous and stop taking it. Rinse repeat. Adding L-Tyrosine has prevented that cycle from re-occurring. 


Start with 500mg L-Tyrosine in the morning at least one hour before eating (must be taken together with Vitamin B complex) be aware that adding coffee may induce anxiety. 

You can then take 50mg of 5-HTP at bed time (10:1). Some brands come with low doses of B6 & B12 & Magnesium citrate included which aid in absorption. 

Then you can up the 5-HTP to 100mg (5:1) to see how it feels. Ofc you can also up the L-tyrosine to 1000mg too keeping the ratio at 10:1, but see what works for you. 

L-Theanine helps loads for anxiety, but is non sedating and calming. Take 150mg as needed. Morning. Lunch time. Bed time. Just double check max daily dose I’m not sure what it is.  

CoQ10 supports your cardiovascular system, as well as attenuating oxidative stress, and improving your body’s ability to respond to stress. Also helps with fatigue. 

I also take omega 3 complex in the morning just because it’s good for my brain. 


I am not a scientist. But this supplement stack turned our lives around. We were both at panic station for like 2 weeks not eating, struggling to find the motivation to take care of ourselves. This all changed rapidly when I decided to do some research and pick these supplements up and started dosing myself and my missus as above.  

We’re no longer on pharmaceuticals (other than stimulant meds I take for ADHD) and we’re leading happy and productive lives again. 



I settled on: 

500mg L-Tyrosine morning
Vitamin B complex (incl zinc) in the morning
Omega 3 complex in the morning 
150mg L-Theanine (optional) in the morning
All at least an hour before food. 


500mg L-Tyrosine before lunch 
500mg CoQ10 before lunch 
150mg L-Theanine before lunch 

100mg 5-HTP before bed 
150mg L-Theanine before bed 
1000IU Vitamin D before bed 
150mg Magnesium before bed

Anxiety,yuo9xy,j7ia9yg,Do you mind me asking if you are on any medications?  SSRIs are known to cause heightened anxiety.  A paradoxical effect.,1
Anxiety,yuo9xy,jbci7oi,"My dr has fired me as a patient basically, saying he can’t help me any further, I’ve been having chest pains and breathing trouble for 2 years now and they can’t find anything wrong. I’m having panic attacks almost daily because I’m convinced each day is my last. It’s destroying my life 😭",1
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwayka8,Great advice!,2
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwbia65,"This is extremely helpful! My first challenge is learning to tell myself to stop and realize it’s just anxiety and to see how my physical symptoms change. Much easier said than done hahaha!

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your advice. It’s so helpful and I will be referencing it moving forward. Also, I love your demogorgon avatar. We live close to the Creel house!",2
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwayptg,What got me out of deep health anxiety was my therapist telling me that thinking of a certain illness and fatal fate can bring it on and literally kill you… even if that wasn’t 100% factual it made me motivated to stop the bullshit,1
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd67j2,I get it! It’s frustrating! How do you know what to trust or not? That’s why I said screw it and went to the doctor to get checked because I wasn’t going to keep putting it off if it was still hanging around.,1
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd5oht,Thank you! It’s no damn fun. I am on Prozac and the increased dosage seems to be helping but time will tell.,2
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd45go,I also struggle with fatigue! It just does something to you that drains every ounce of energy from your body. Plus I love naps lol,2
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwctah9,"This is literally me, same age and everything. Journaling helps and not googling symptoms!!",3
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd4e2z,I’m so sorry you’re struggling with this too! It’s weird how we are kind of rewired after children and it spirals into a whole new form.,1
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd5jp4,"I highly recommend medication. I was on Zoloft for over 10 years and eventually was in a place where I didn’t need it. After my daughter, I was started on Wellbutrin but it didn’t work so I have been on Prozac which helped but now I am up to 20mg which seems to be helping thankfully.

Outside of medication for my depression and anxiety, I’m not a big medicine taker so I totally understand. Even my husband is, unfortunately, not a big medicine taker and even he isn’t supportive of taking medication for depression/anxiety but that’s a whole different story and I ignore him lol",2
Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwd5v34,"Thank you, and you too! Honestly, just hearing “I feel you” or “you’re not alone” and getting other stories such as yours are extremely helpful.",1

Anxiety,yuo9xy,iwdo5rz,I def know where your coming from. I have found making a plan ans doing research on anxiety has really helped me. Also journaling! Journal for 15 minutes and then reading it back to yourself has really helped me. I also just started therapy so hopefully that helps too,2
Anxiety,eza48w,fglwp7i,I understand it feels really tough right now but it will be better and you will be okay. There are other jobs that might be better at actually seeing to your needs,44
Anxiety,eza48w,fgm06mx,"Hey! It IS going to be okay!

The end of December my mental health took a plunge due to a few circumstances, one of the main ones was how badly my job had treated me over the last year alone. I couldn't go back. I called out and then finally sent a resignation letter through email because I couldn't take it anymore on top of the other outside issues I was facing. I haven't even looked at that building and I live 15 minutes away.

I was scared as hell because I was trying to find work before leaving but my mind and body said enough.

I don't regret leaving, I am in a much better place mentally, AND I start a job in 2 weeks! A place I interviewed for in December, that is giving me a pay increase, life balance, and I know I will be in good hands based on how they treated me in interview and how happy my friend has been after a year there(who came from the same miserable company I just left).

My finances suck a little bit right now, but it IS okay because I know I will be caught up in no time once I start.

It IS going to be okay. Never let some place have that much power over you.

Breathe, take a self care day and recuperate. You need it, keep moving forward and you will go further than where you were.",28
Anxiety,eza48w,fgm7gvr,You deserve a better employer and you will het that :),21
Anxiety,eza48w,fgmd26w,"I actually just went through something very similar. I finally got my first job out of college and at first I liked it but after about 3 months it became incredibly stressful and made me so anxious, I dreaded going in every day. My anxiety about my job started to affect my performance and I knew I wasn't doing great but about 3 weeks ago I was called into HR and told that I was being fired for poor performance. I was definitely surprised but honestly I'm happy I never have to go back to that place. My department was notoriously stressful and difficult and it was taking a huge toll on my mental health to the point where I couldn't sleep. I'm applying for new jobs now and it definitely isn't fun but I'd rather interview again than stay at that terrible job. I know how you're feeling, we have to keep going and eventually it will get better. I know it doesn't seem that way but it will.",8
Anxiety,eza48w,fgmkr9i,"Do you know how many jobs there are out there that you can get?? A lot. Do not let some irrelevant employer ruin you day. You’ll find a better job and you’ll be so happy there. You will do better and your old boss will hopefully be there to see it so they can know what a great employee/person they’ve lost. Everything is going to be okay, and everything happens for a reason. You do not need that job, your mental health is sooo much more important. Keep your head up, I promise it will get better. 

And I hope that some time in the future you have one of those “who’s laughing now” moments with your boss when they see you doing so much better. 

You will bloom from here I believe in you!!xx",9
Anxiety,eza48w,fgma5dy,It is definitely going to be okay! I experienced something like this and it caused me so much stress and anxiety I was getting migraines and waking up in middle of the night with panic attacks and pain shooting down my back. It’s NOT worth it. You deserve to work for people who value you and appreciate you and are understanding about your mental health. Unfortunately that’s rare these days but NO job is worth compromising your mental health. I have faith that better opportunities are coming for you!,6

Anxiety,eza48w,fgm6zrs,"I am really sorry this has happened to you. You will be okay, so many people have been fired for the most absurd reasons, yet many have managed to find better work places. 

I am much younger and definitely less experienced than you. However, my dad was laid off by countless workplaces for being different. In the end, he finally found his dream job where he gets respected as one of the most important members, and the company always makes compromises and negotiates with him so that he never leaves.

Another example is that I genuinely thought I was completely unemployable because I couldn't find a job before uni. Now I have over a year and a half of kitchen experience with a restaurant, and I have recently begun my university placement and my work from home job as a technical assistant. 

I know these are anecdotes but what I am trying to say is that our emotions are not always reliable, and if anything, are often deceitful. You are not a failure. You are a human being who has his limits. Good luck with your future job search! You will find a new position without any problems.",5

Anxiety,16n8aqm,k1d0c51,Take a step back. We often become obsessed with the validation to confirm that we are fine. On the same boat as you. I tend to focus on the heart. I normally put legs against the wall. Stay for a few minutes. I also take magnesium glycinate and go for a small walk. It also helps,8

Anxiety,16n8aqm,k1dghya,"The thing that’s been helping me the most with my health anxiety is the curable app and program! I doubted it would work for me at first, but it has blown me away so far. Basically the worse your anxiety gets, especially relating to health fears, the more it can create symptoms for you. Curable helps to retrain your brain not to manifest anxiety in symptoms and to get to the root of the anxiety overall. It’s a wonderful platform - you can do just the app (what I do) or join workshops, counseling, and groups through it. I recommend starting with the visualizations! They literally stopped my pain on day one and made me realize it was my anxiety causing it all along. I nearly cried from relief.",3
Anxiety,16n8aqm,k1d9w25,"I recently started counseling and I found that for me the big question that helped solve some of my more extreme health anxiety was, what am I afraid of? From there my counselor and I dug down deep to find the answer and form a solution to accept that fear while realizing there was no reason to really be afraid of it.


So basically Id suggest that you find a counsellor or therapist or someone that will professionally dig into your concerns to find the root of the anxiety. once you figure out the root perhaps you can better understand it and become more effective at mitigating or handling it so you have less anxiety related to it.


Now Im working with my counselor to help deal with a set of trauma triggers related to that original issue and ive been seeing positive results. Professional counseling really helps!",2

Anxiety,16n8aqm,k1f8ixt,"This was me last month I swear something felt wrong but I went to ER and the scans were fine. Who knows what the pains are but I do feel discomfort but dr says it could be muscle related or nerve related. I feel better about that bjt now it’s just my head 😊 I need a scan of my head cus I feel pressure sometimes in my eye when I cough. Health anxiety is really hard to manage. I didn’t go to the ER for a year until recently but since then I forgot about it. I am 25 y/o I think with time it does get better. I think distracting yourself with a hobby or interest when you’re thinking about it helps. For me, I’ll get on the game or watch anime and I’ll eventually forget about it.

Anxiety,16n8aqm,k1fcfna,"I have this too very very bad! My advice would be to get in contact with a doctor / nurse practitioner and get a full body physical, as well as a blood test to rule out anything for peace of mind. 

Also there are some books that I have read that kinda helped 

“Help me I’m a hypochondriac” by Philip martins 

“The anxiety and phobia work book” by Edmund Bourne

Anxiety,1fz8wt4,lqzypco,"Ahhh bless you. It's lovely that you are so into each other that this is a big worry, but I do think your mind has maybe fixated on an issue that caused trouble in the past (normal!)

I think it's very unlikely. Economies are still recovering from covid and it would have to be incredibly serious for any large country to risk that again. Also - it doesn't happen overnight. There would be a build up / increase in numbers before that decision was made, giving you time to get to each other. I would tell your brain, let's set this one aside for now and reevaluate if the situation changes",1
Anxiety,1fz8wt4,lr0cfvl,Nope and even if it could happen again you'll be ready this time.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,l5k4qae,"Thanks for this. I experience a ton of similar symptoms as well and it’s horrible given I have severe hypochondria. Any bodily sensation that feels just a tiny bit off sets off the entire alarm system in me and I just end up spiralling.

I pretty much checked all of these off! I feel so constantly sick as well and my health anxiety is so bad that I cannot function most of the time. 

This list makes me feel better and less crazy :) a lot of people tell me I have no reason to worry, but I can’t explain how it eats me alive. these things seem so scary and hard for me to manage that I just isolate myself when experiencing them. So happy to know these feelings aren’t something I just experience!!",6
Anxiety,1czzuoo,l5lcw8u,Thanks for this I have severe health anxiety currently and suffer from a lot of these. I am really conscious and hyper aware of my symptoms.,7
Anxiety,1czzuoo,lwwknq7,"Hello everyone. I’m currently recovering from GAD. It’s been a challenge. I’m a commercial pilot and the stress from work and personal life took a big toll on my life these last two years. I impulsively resigned from a job that I enjoyed. The job did have some stress involved, but for the most part I really enjoyed it. I am recovering from GAD, however, trying to get my job back has been very stressful which doesn’t help me as I’m trying to recover. I was at that job for close to 23 years. 

The symptoms I experienced last year before I eventually sought help in July of this year was brain fog, dizziness, loss of concentration, unable to focus, my cognitive ability to think rationally and make decisions was impaired . Tension headaches, trembling, tinnitus, worrying constantly, insomnia, fatigue, claustrophobia, a feeling of not able to control my decisions and now I have this former employer that won’t take me back because I was in a vulnerable state of mind to have people convince me to leave for another job that I didn’t want because I’m getting close to retirement. So, now I have two hills to climb during my recovery. I really didn’t need this. None of us do!

I was so cognitively out of it when I left my former employer that I didn’t realize what I was doing starting over again until the first week of the new job. I finally realized that this is not my old job and that there is something mentally wrong with me. The best decision I made was to seek help. However, I was longer at my former job. This is going to be a real challenge. 

The symptoms I had described earlier, I had gone to the doctor last year to see what was wrong with me. I thought I may have long covid because I had covid in 2020 and 2022. The PCR tests came back negative and I was diagnosed with a viral infection. So, when I wasn’t flying I would take Sudafed to help with the dizziness, but the dizziness still came back. I thought there may have been loose crystals in my vestibular system, so I tried repositioning them by laying down and moving my head side to side. No change. I saw the doctor again. Same diagnosis. Eventually, I just delt with it not realizing that it was GAD that was causing these symptoms. Unfortunately, it took losing a good job to find out what I was dealing with. 

Yes, this really sux, but I can’t let this beat me. All I can do is continue receiving treatment and use my coping skills to fight this disorder. As for my former job, it’s going to a challenge to getting it back. Whats sad is that mental health issues are a stigma in aviation, so pilots are less willing to fess up and seek help until it’s too late. I sought help, but the doctors never determined that it could be psychological. After I had left my former employer and I realized that there was a problem with me my symptoms sky rocketed and I became a mental mess. But I never gave up. Believe me there are days that I wonder why this happened to me, but I keep telling myself to not give up. This is just another challenge to prove to how vulnerable our lives can be and that we can beat this through professional and peer support.

Never quit. Never give up",8
Anxiety,1czzuoo,l5kq0sj,"So many of these symptoms I didn't realize had to do with my anxiety. Being sick for 3wks plus with a cold I can't shake. Heart flutters/palpitations. Being SO VERY VERY TIRED. Nauseous all the time. The confusion and thinking I'm crazy!!! 

I have been fighting taking meds and I am to a point where I may have to do. Even my therapist suggested it 😩",7
Anxiety,1czzuoo,l5leb2f,"Thanks very much for this. I always suffered a bit of social anxiety but the past 4 months have been very very exhausting and my anxiety has ruled my life like never before. A lot of these symptoms are familiar to me, it’s good to know I’m not alone. 

The depersonalisation derealisation is the most frightening experience I’ve had, I didn’t know there was a term for it. If you could share some coping mechanisms for that in particular I’d appreciate it.

I do feel like I’m coming out of the worst of this anxiety episode, and I went to a very very dark place for a while. Luckily I have tremendous family support. 

If anyone is really struggling don’t hesitate to message me and I’ll try to help. These feelings do pass, even though they feel like they never will.",7

Anxiety,1czzuoo,mars8tv,"My RECOVERY

**My Journey Through Depersonalization, Derealization, Anxiety, blurry vision, panic attacks, visual snow etc.. 

It all began with excessive deep thinking—questioning everything, analyzing every detail of existence, reality, and creation. I spent countless hours lost in existential thoughts, pondering the meaning of life, the nature of consciousness, and the origins of the universe. These questions consumed me, pulling me deeper into my mind until I felt trapped within it. What started as curiosity spiraled into something far more overwhelming: depersonalization, derealization, anxiety, extreme brain fog, blurry vision, visual snow, depression, and an unrelenting sense of disconnection from the world around me.

For about a year, these symptoms dominated my life. I couldn’t work, focus on tasks, or even engage in simple daily activities. It was as if my mind had become a labyrinth with no exit, and I was stuck wandering its endless corridors. Despite this struggle, I want to emphasize that none of this was induced by alcohol or drugs—I’ve never used either. My experience stemmed purely from overthinking and dwelling on profound, often abstract concepts also paired with discovering that many of the things we know as our reality is actually not real or true like money as a currency, the food we eat (GMO’s,processed foods), movie industry, news etc..) 

When I first encountered others online who described similar struggles, I felt hope. Realizing I wasn't alone reduced my symptoms by about 20%. There's immense power in knowing someone else understands what you're going through. Still, I knew I needed professional guidance, so I sought help from a psychologist after my doktor suggested it to me. While he listened attentively to my problems, his solution—a prescription for antidepressants—felt insufficient and he actually never heard of the terms DP/DR. Though medication might alleviate some symptoms temporarily i never took them and only went once to the psychologist.

These experiences don’t occur without reason. For some, they stem from spiritual crises; for others, physical imbalances. In my case, the primary culprit was excessive deep thinking. By constantly living in my head, ruminating on the past (which I couldn’t change) or worrying about the future (which I couldn’t predict), I neglected the present moment—the only time we truly have control over. This mental habit left me disconnected from reality, anxious, and depressed.

To overcome these challenges, I realized I needed to make fundamental changes in my lifestyle. Here’s what worked for me:

1. **Sleep Quality Over Quantity**: Sleeping longer didn’t solve my issues—it was the quality of sleep that mattered. Establishing a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed, and making a calming environment helped improve my restorative sleep.

2. **Healthy Eating Habits**: Switching to a diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods while reducing carb intake significantly boosted my energy levels and mental clarity. Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in stabilizing mood and cognitive function.

3. **Exercise**: Physical activity became a cornerstone of my recovery. Whether it was walking outdoors, soccer, or strength training, exercise not only improved my physical health but also provided a much-needed outlet for stress and anxiety.

4. **Social Connection**: Isolation worsened my symptoms, so reconnecting with friends and family was vital. Engaging in meaningful conversations and shared activities reminded me of the joy and connection available in the present moment.


5. **Breaking Old Patterns**: To heal, I had to break free from old habits that perpetuated my suffering. This meant stepping out of my comfort zone, taking small actions each day, and focusing on progress rather than perfection.

Ultimately, there is no magic pill or quick fix for these kinds of struggles. Recovery requires effort, patience, and self-awareness. If you’re experiencing similar challenges, know that you are not alone. Recognize the triggers—whether they’re rooted in excessive thinking, unhealthy habits, or emotional wounds—and take proactive steps toward healing. 

Today, I’m grateful for the journey because it taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, presence, and self-care. Life may still bring uncertainties, but I’ve learned to navigate them with greater peace and purpose. Remember, your mind has incredible potential to heal when given the right tools and attention. Take one step at a time, and trust the process.

Conclusion: All of this did not happen without a reason and the creator Allah swt does not burden a soul what he/she cannot bear. Stop defending that which is taking power from you like depression, dp/dr, anxiety and attack it. This all happened to you because you might be extra sensitive, emotionally build, past trauma’s but it does not mean you have to take it as your identity. Change the way you think, change the way you eat, change the way you sleep. You have to take action now and don’t let anyone label you with unsolvable mental issue and put you on medication for the rest of your life. One thing I can guarantee is that whilst you are experiencing all of these things is that you are not in the best shape of your life, you don’t know how to eat proper food which came from creation and not what mankind designed and changed genetically. The way you sleep is not on point. You have a lot of goals but don’t act upon them. Either you belive in a creator or not don’t forget that this life is a test and as a man trauma and difficulties build you up so you can become a better version of you…",3

Feeling anxious about this 


I feel like I’m going down the spiral with my anxiety and health anxiety especially and I need to know if any of you ever experienced physical symptoms like I did.

Recently I have been struggling with headaches. The headache starts behind my left temple on the top, sometimes a bit more behind and goes to my neck, sometimes to my ear and on the right side. It’s usually moderate and numb pain. One time when I was anxious and it was extremely humid outside I got this pain on the left side that felt like someone hit me on that side, and after a few seconds and rest it stopped and never came back. I tend to have this moderate headache often and even though two neurologists reassured me that I’m fine I am so scared of aneurysm. I don’t have a family history of aneurysms, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I am a 26 year old white female with a normal blood pressure too. 
On top of that I have this bell ringing sensation in one of my ears but not with headaches. For the past two days I felt a bit nauseous and tired but after taking a nap it went away. But then I started feeling dry mouth and had to drink lots of water. This headache lasts for a few seconds and minutes, goes away and comes back. Sometimes when I change positions it helps. It usually happens when it’s hot and/or humid outside, when I’m anxious, stressed, or angry, if I drink too much Coke Zero or when I’m tired. I don’t know what to do. I also obsessively check my pupils size and my vision and sometimes I have a feeling that my vision in one eye is weaker a bit but then goes back to normal and goes into the other eye. I’m just scared. Has anyone had a headache like that? I don’t know what to do at this point.",2

Anxiety,1czzuoo,lr7xkux," A post like this provides relief. But then afew days later you know you'll be searching for another post that reaffirms all the same things.   
  
And then you'll be searching again and again in the hope that one day the circle can be broken.  
  
And another thing about anxiety, is that if you Google any of the symptoms, Google will almost always give you some horrendous disease or illness in return to stress about.   
  
Practically all the symptoms OP listed will have an anxiety sufferer thinking 'cancer', 'heart disease', 'brain tumour', 'alzheimer's' etc etc. And you'll be thinking; ""I KNOW it's anxiety, but WHAT IF this time IT ISN'T ?!""

And Doctors will patronize you and write you off as a 'basket case'.  
Or want to give you anxiety drugs whose side effects are as bad as anxiety itself !  
  
Or maybe one Doctor will say ""You have PPPD"".   
And another will say ""PPPD is something we Doctors invented to get rid of annoying patients and give them peace of mind, kind of like the IT Help Desk telling you to reboot your PC to get you off the phone"".

Anxiety,1czzuoo,lhgy82y,"This is Schiz-OCD?? Fear going crazy

First of all, I want to say that this will be translated since I am Spanish and I do not understand English well, I hope it is understood in the best way.

I am Victor from Spain, I am 20 years old and I have had anxiety since I was little, on May 9, 2022 this hell began from which I am still just as bad, that day as soon as I woke up I had thoughts of harming myself, they came involuntarily and they scared me a lot since I did not know why I had them because I did not and do not want to hurt myself, I was very scared and anxious, my chest hurt, I had trouble breathing, I ate little, I slept with my mother ... I thought this would be because of a bad day and that it would go away on its own but unfortunately it was not like that, a few days after this, being in my room, from one moment to the next out of nowhere this thought crossed my mind: What if I kill my mother? At that moment I started to cry, I didn’t know what was happening to me, because I had that kind of thoughts, it had never happened to me and I was very scared, after this I decided to go to the psychiatrist to tell him about this and he told me about OCD, I didn’t know what it was but reading about it fit with what was happening to me, after a few days, exactly on May 27, 2022, I saw a news story on television about a mental illness called schizophrenia, I was in shock, it was like, I have this... At that time I didn’t know exactly the symptoms of that disease, I more or less knew what the disease was but I didn’t know the symptoms in depth, when I saw that news I entered a loop that lasted about 4/5 months which every day I read and watched forums, videos about the symptoms of this disease, I read about delusions and hallucinations, from that moment on I was aware of the noises I could hear, I tried to find out where I heard the noises to know if they were real or not. it was a real noise or a hallucination, if i was watching a video and i heard something that i thought could be outside of that video i would rewind the video to see if i could hear it again, around that time i don’t know if it was due to stress i developed floaters and i confused them with hallucinations, sometimes out of the corner of my eye i would see flashes and it would scare me, sometimes when i would go to sleep in that phase of falling asleep sometimes i could “hear” my own thoughts, it was very strange, they were like random thoughts of things that had happened to me during the day and i would get scared that they were hallucinations. There is also the other symptom that scared me, which was delusions, I read about them and after reading I noticed that I had those same thoughts but I knew they were lies, for example, I read that a delusion is an idea that is given 100% veracity even if it is proven with clear evidence that it is not true but the belief about that idea is still maintained, such as believing that they are going to kill you without having proof that it is true, well after reading about delusions I have that style of thoughts but I know they are lies, what happens is that I am afraid that from one day to the next I start to believe them and start to rave, to summarize, I have paranoid thoughts but I know they are lies, all this comes from reading about schizophrenia, I think reading about the symptoms has screwed up my head, any help?",1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,li16b5a,I’ve been on a spiral the past week. Always dealt with anxiety daily but haven’t dealt with panic attacks in about 15 years and I’ve been in a constant panic attack. My anxiety is usually OCD mind racing isolating type anxiety not “I think I’m dying” anxiety and the past week it’s been that. I feel so much better right now because I haven’t been eating and I think that makes my anxiety extremely worse (low blood sugar and hypertension) which cause real symptoms which make the other “real” symptoms from anxiety so much worse.

I really feel like it’s taking what life I have left away from me worst thing try and get a doctor appointment a psychiatrist or psychologist. I really don’t have anyone to help me.and because I’m now 72 I’ll the drs make me feel like because of my age they just don’t want to take any time with me. I’m having a severe one now they’re getting longer & more intense. The kind of drs I’ve mentioned their waiting list are 4-6 months long or worse.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,lxjg8x9,"Bonjour, je te remercie infiniment pour le travail que tu fais. Je me permets de m’adresser à toi, j’espère que je ne te dérangerai pas. Je te remercie d’avance pour ta lecture.

 Je suis un immense anxieux et stressé depuis ma première crise de panique à 18 ans. J’ai vécu par le passé plusieurs des symptômes de l’anxiété sévère que tu as présenté ici et je suis parvenu à les surmonter grâce à l’acceptation, la compréhension et l’exposition. 

Toutefois j’ai une inquiétude immense concernant mon état actuel, j’ai 25ans et je n’arrive pas à savoir si ce que j’ai en ce moment sont des symptômes de l’anxiété, puisque certains d’entre eux ne sont pas cités dans ta liste.

 J’ai une peur terrible d’être dans la phase prodromique de la schizophrénie et qu’il ne s’agisse plus seulement de symptomes liés à mon anxiété sévère que je traîne depuis mes 18ans, d’autant que je suis un consommateur excessif de cannabis depuis ma plus tendre adolescence. J’ai peur que cette anxiété sévère que j’ai depuis 7 ans et toutes ses manifestations symptomatiques, n’étaient finalement qu’une annonce d’une entrée dans la schizophrénie.

Tout a commencé il y a maintenant 1 mois, après un évènement et un contexte particulièrement stressant (entretien d’embauche). Durant cette année j’ai renversé de force mon rythme de sommeil au moins 6 fois, ne dormant pas de la nuit pour retrouver un rythme normal. Je sentais que cela affectait considérablement mon cerveau, mais mon incapacité à conserver un rythme jour/nuit normal m’y obligeait.

 Le lendemain de cet entretien très stressant qui représentait, pour moi et toute ma famille mon entrée dans le monde du travail, j’avais en ma possession deux types de cannabis différents. J’ai consommé plusieurs joints du premier type, jusque là tout allait bien, puis j’ai consommé 1 joint du second type. Dès la consommation de ce second type de cannabis, j’ai immédiatement senti mon état cognitif se dégrader brutalement.

 Je vais te citer du mieux possible ce que je ressens :

 

\-       Toute prise de parole me semble coûteuse en énergie et ne me vient plus de façon spontanée et naturelle, au point où je préfère ne pas parler, ou ne pas répondre. Cela a radicalement changé mes rapports sociaux, je n’ai plus aucun plaisir à interagir car cela me semble anormalement difficile et désagréable. Je me force à parler.

\-       Hors de la maison j’ai la sensation que mon cerveau n’arrive plus à correctement traiter la quantité d’informations visuelles et autres stimulations sensorielles.

\-       Il y a une forme de DP/DR mais qui ne ressemble pas à ce que j’ai pu vivre avant, les choses me semblent effectivement réelles mais j’ai la sensation que mon cerveau n’arrive plus à les traiter et donc je ne me sens plus vraiment ancré. Avec une sensation très bizarre lorsque je me regarde dans le miroir, où je me reconnais très bien mais je n’arrive pas à maintenir mon attention sur mon reflet.

\-       La concentration visuelle est très difficile, je le remarque notamment lorsque je regarde un match de basket, où je n’arrive plus à percevoir de façon claire les mouvements de chaque joueur.

\-       Les tâches habituellement simples me semblent anormalement complexes sur le plan cognitif, me faire un café, faire à manger, prendre une douche… Lorsque je sors faire les courses, c’est une catastrophe, je suis complètement submergé par toutes les stimulations visuelles extérieures, pareil lorsque je vais dans un endroit public ou lorsque je suis dans un trajet de voiture.

\-       J’ai une grande perte d’intérêt pour quasiment tout ce qui me plaisait auparavant et j’ai une diminution considérable de mes émotions. Plus rien n’est une source de plaisir, cet état m’empêche de pouvoir prendre du plaisir par rapport à quoique ce soit. Cela est flagrant au niveau du rire lorsque quelqu’un fait une blague drôle, j’ai l’impression de rire comme mécaniquement, mais sans en ressentir l’émotion en moi.

\-       Lors de moments sociaux avec plusieurs personnes je n’arrive plus à interagir correctement et à m’insérer dans la discussion collective. Lorsque je prends la parole je n’arrive pas à m’exprimer comme je le souhaite et spontanément, je n’arrive pas à transmettre correctement mes idées.

\-       J’ai des hallucinations auditives et olfactives récurrentes depuis qu’un psychiatre, au vu de ces symptomes, a proposé un arrêt de l’anti-dépresseur (que je prenais depuis plusieurs années) pour passer à un anti-psychotique dont j’ai lu qu’il était quasi uniquement donné dans les cas de schizophrénie.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,lzxclzq,I have like 85% of these symptoms,1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,m00ag85,"Hola, tengo toc y ansiedad desde que soy una niña con todos tus síntomas al completo, ya tengo 37 y sigo igual, pero desde hace 4 meses tuve un ataque de pánico por una pesadilla y lo peor que hice fue buscar los síntomas en google y terminas leyendo cosas y síntomas de lo más temido, la esquizofrenia, bueno después de buscar eso he estado FATAL, pensando que tengo esos síntomas, somatizando todo. Estuve en cama dos semanas llorando a diario. 

 Con ataques de pánico 24/7, empecé el psicólogo y empecé a hacer cosas pero siempre con una agonía en el pecho brutal ya no podía vivir así, y empecé a tomar lorazepan, jamas tome medicina, pero me relajo un poco pero cuando se va el efecto vivo en un miedo constante, ya no quiero ni salir, me cuesta la vida socializar pero disimulo bastante bien aunque por dentro esté muriéndome literalmente. 

Debo decir que tengo toc sobre todo de hipocondria es el más marcado desde niña entonces esto es un martirio.

Los dos psicólogos que he tenido me dicen que tengo toc de libro y sigo sin creerlos, mi mente obsesiva está convencida de que estoy desarrollando esquizofrenia..

No me atrevo ir al psiquiatra por si ve algo más o me atiborra a antidepresivos..

Lógicamente ya no me apetece hacer nada y me cuesta la vida hablar porque estoy pendiente de lo que hablo de lo que pienso 24 horas hasta cuando estoy empezando a dormir tb estoy pendiente de mis sueños..es brutal la autovigilancia..

Luego cuando “no pienso o no estoy atenta” todo me sale con más naturalidad..

Tengo todos tipos de parasomnias, duermo pero me levanto muchísimo, sueño fragmentado..

Quiero salir de esta obsesión como las otras que he tenido sobre enfermedades físicas pero esta me está costando la vida, porque es uno de mis mayores temores..

Que puedo hacer?😔",1

I have the feeling that I'm going downhill. I have to work 6 days a week for my income, so that also give's a lot of pressure.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,mkdz6oi,"Health anxiety is torture both physically and mentally. Seeing your list of symptoms definitely helps, the problem with health anxiety is we kind of already know it's anxiety but there's that voice in your head saying 'but what if'. At least for me that's the case. 


At the moment my main issue is shaking both internally and externally. Have been on propranolol for a while but have also been put on setraline now too. This latest case of severe anxiety has been going on now for about 8months, and it's certainly the hardest I've found it. I've had the internal tremors before but it's just lasting a lot longer which increases anxiety more. If I don't think about it, it kind of goes away, it's mostly in my shoulders and chest area but will get it elsewhere. Definitely seems related to muscle tension.


Absolutely hate it.",1

I did not believe that something in your head could manifest itself physically to that extreme and just leave me completely inept and broken. I started sertraline (Walmart Zoloft) soon after and it helped tremendously. However I stopped taking it after a few years because I thought I was ‘cured’.

I have been to the ER 5 times this week cause I thought I was going nuts. I first went for my tongue cause I thought it wasn’t “normal” then it turned into a whole bunch of things. They ended up giving me prednisone the 3rd time I went, which immediately had a reaction on me. (I have PTSD aswell) I ended up having blurred vision in my one eye and it FREAKED me out. Today I went to the ER and they took my blood and a CT scan and everything came back normal and they diagnosed me with Anxiety Reaction Paresthesia (never knew there was so many different types of anxiety) they referred me to see a neurologist to see my nerves and probably put me on medication. It sucks because even though they said everything came back normal my left eye is still blurry. But I see my primary tomorrow so hopefully I can treat my anxiety quick. Anxiety SUCKS",1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,mxrih8g,"I can't believe this made me feel so much better, so thanks. For the last week or so I've been a little off, like worrying about every little thing under the sun. Like my neck would feel slightly tight (probably just from being tense ngl) and just like that I'm convincing myself I've got meningitis or something. Same thing with pretty much everything else, even stuff I'd already experienced before and didn't worry about at the time. Essentially my brain had decided that every single thing on my body that isn't perfectly working absolutely must mean death. But after reading your list and realizing I've been having almost half the things on it, I actually think the tight feeling in my chest just went away. So I'm real glad you shared your list, thanks :)

My brain is like so confused all the time and I feel like I have been like this for years and I have no interactions outside my house. The most concerning worry that I have is my memory, reading comprehension and speaking part ,it feels like I’m not a graduate at all. My speaking and thinking abilities are /have slowed down drastically. I get intimidated by people who speak and express theirselves clearly. I don’t know if this is anxiety or something but I constantly have no confidence in me to speak at all like even if I want to speak and be happy it’s like I have to try so hard. One more thing that I’ve noticed is that I’m super aware of how I say the words and I’m constantly keep telling myself that I’m dumb and can’t even speak something normally. I also struggle with grammar and tenses while speaking and I notice it and get stressed about it. I’m always worrying about this for the past few months.

I wrote about my full recovery on a website on my page. You should check it out! Its a non profit organization and I made it to help everyone.

1. Exposures. Expose yourself as much as possible to fears. You need to desensitize yourself to all irrational fears. Do things progressively. I didn't hope on a plane the first weeks I started dealing with 24/7 anxiety and panic attacks. I couldnt even leave my house around that time. I started exposing myself to all fears. Leaving the house, driving alone, being alone, being around people, in closed environments, outside, and eventually planes and more extreme things. You need to expose yourself to desensitze your fears, but make progress at a good pace. It takes patience

2. Read and understand about anxiety, symptoms, ocd etc. This helped me alot. Why? Because it shows you that anxiety is just a natural human response. It gets severe because of so many factors like severe trauma, stress, bad habits, drugs, bad lifestlyes etc. I had 1 panic attack that completely changed my life. It caught me by surprise. But when I actually seen the lifestyle I was carrying for the last 3 years, I realized severe anxiety was imminent. Trauma, stress, barely sleeping, working 2 jobs and going to school full time, etc. 

3. Accept all anxiety, intrusive thoughts, fears, symptoms, uncertainty. Accept all of it, that its not a monster. Its harmless. It takes resilience, patience, and so many attempts to get this down. This was especially helpful for intrusive thoughts. I used to have panic attacks over intrusive thoughts, but I became resilient over time with them. They did not affect me, and neither did the symptoms. They lost a hold of me and all power over me.

4. Try to lead a healthy lifestyle. This helped me so much. I moved out of an abusive household and this sped up recovery in my opinion. It sucks that this is not always an option for people which is hell. Exercise, try vitamins to see if they help, set up a consistent sleep schedule, manage stress levels well. Try to notice when your stress level increase and then take a step back to relax. I remember working 1-2 hours lead to symptoms for me. I never pushed it, I stopped and knew my limits. Long drives also were hell for me, they gave me so many anxiety symptoms and brought on ocd symptoms. Know your limits and over time your body will recover.

5. Patience. Your nervous system is extremely dysregulated. It takes months to years for it to return to regular levels. Your fight or flight is permanately turned on and needs time to go back to normal. Stay strong, seek help and try therapy if you can.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,m9vp4zw,How are you now?,1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,mmnv34c,"Your story made me cry. I have a similar story as a professional. Been in a GAD anxiety cycle for a good year now. Been at my profession for 27 years, but have hardly worked during this past year. Dealing with the symptoms is hard enough, but then dealing with the cascading failures of how it affects your whole life is a mountain to climb in itself. Your relationships suffer, job suffers, career suffers, and finances suffer. It's a lot to manage when you are just trying to survive when your body is stuck in fight or flight. The dizziness, woozy, brain fog stuff is one of my worst symptoms....mainly because it's so darn hard to do anything when you feel like your mind isn't clear....like being drugged or something. Are you doing better? I sure hope you get your job back and you are healthy again. Keep moving forward. it takes along time, but we will get through it🙏",1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,mgxld9y,hey how are you doing now?,1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,l5ls3af,"Hi! I struggle with very bad derealization as well and what work best for me is to simply accept that it’s there, don’t try to fight it. It might be scary because you feel although nothing is real and disconnected but the more your ignore it the faster it goes away",2

My support system is fantastic, but so many times I think that they just think I’m being dramatic or weak (oh how the mind plays tricks on us) when I just want to scream that I literally feel like I’m going to have a heart attack, pass out and shit myself all at the same time if I leave my house. That I’m tired ALL the time, not because I don’t want to do anything, but because my body is in fight mode 24/7 and I don’t feel peace and contentment anymore.  Praying for you and hope you can find some relief soon!!❤️",3

Anxiety,1czzuoo,m9z686q,"i experience sharp pains and gurgling when I'm really gassy. It's probably just gas. If it lasts for more than a week and it's really concerning to you, talk with your doctor. I doubt it's anything serious, though. Anxiety makes you hyperaware of physical sensations.

Anxiety,1czzuoo,mxrbtn9,Mine to i have random stabing pain all over my body randomly and in my joints especially. Only last a second or two but they are so painful and that causes me to think I have something wrong with me then I start to over think and that just ends of making it worse.,1

Anxiety,1czzuoo,lxjgbht,"Je pense avoir énuméré l’essentiel de ce que je ressens. Ce nouvel état cognitif/mental est absolument permanent, même dans mes rêves. Cette forme de diminution fonctionnelle et cognitive est très handicapante et a généré un isolement social total. Je ne suis qu’avec ma mère et ne sort quasiment pas de la maison. Je ne discute plus avec mes amis car je n’arrive plus à y ressentir de plaisir.

 

Pour toutes ces raisons je n’ai plus de vie et n’existe plus. Je passe ma journée dans ma chambre à chercher sur Google ce qui m’arrive, c’est la seule chose qui m’intéresse. Je suis dans une inquiétude permanente, surtout liée au fait que ce que j’ai ressemble beaucoup aux symptomes négatifs de la schizophrénie, qui existent notamment dans la phase débutante, avant l’apparition de la crise délirante aigue.

 

Je me dis en permanence que vivre une vie dans cet état n’a aucun intérêt et pense beaucoup au s… .

 

Ayant gardé le réflexe lié à mes anciennes crises d’anxiété, j’ai tenté d’accepter mes symptomes et de vivre naturellement avec. Mais j’ai observé que, contrairement à avant, ceux là ne s’atténuaient pas lors d’une quelconque activité ou distraction où j’occupe mon esprit, au contraire ils m’apparaissent davantage et m’empêchent de pouvoir tirer de la satisfaction de quoi que ce soit.

 

C’est extrêmement difficile à vivre, d’autant que je ne sais pas s’il s’agit encore une fois des symptomes de l’anxiété ou bien est-ce que cette fois-ci j’ai réellement basculé de l’autre côté.

 

Dis-moi si ce que je raconte ici t’évoque certaines choses, je suis vraiment désolé de te faire lire tout ça mais je suis dans une détresse immense. Encore merci d’exister et de me permettre de te livrer ce message.",1
Anxiety,1czzuoo,m00bohp,"Madre mía tengo el mismo miedo que tú, como sigues? 

Yo hice lo mismo, que es buscar en internet síntomas, y aparece la temida esquizofrenia, eso fué lo peor que he hecho en mi vida, nunca me atreví a leer sus síntomas ( siempre he tenido miedo a la locura ) pero desde un fuerte ataque de pánico que me dio hace 4 meses, me dio por leerlo, y ha sido los peores cuatro meses de mi vida. 

Pienso igual que tú que tengo los síntomas negativos, pero luego pienso que cuando vives aterrorizado es normal no querer salir, que te cueste hablar, o que el miedo te paralice hasta el habla, que no encuentres placer ante tal panorama mental de miedo y que como el mensaje principal dice todo este afectado a nivel cognitivo..

intento pensar en positivo..

pero la mente juega malas pasadas me autoexploro también los pensamientos hasta cuando voy a dormir y estoy cogiendo el sueño, me cuesta mil expresarme, pienso que voy a somatizar todo de ver cosas raras o escuchar cosas raras y eso me aterroriza 24/7.

Mi anterior psicóloga me dijo que tenía toc de libro pero yo sigo pensando que es algo peor ya, que de tanta ansiedad y tanto toc me ha hecho trizas la mente..

Que pesadilla..",1

Anxiety,1czzuoo,malkubv,I have also a weird fear of the sky. I overcame it through exposure. But relapsed after few years. It is a mix of Agoraphobia/ OCD Existential and panic/anxiety. We can’t handle the fact how big the sky is and how big the world is. Never was like this but I hope there are others who recovered and share their story. It makes us depressed and hopeless,2

The only symptom that I really still struggle with is feeling dpdr all the time, and my brain still thinks it’s a threat no matter how much I rationally know it’s there to protect me. I think working full time hasn’t helped my recovery but thankfully I quit next week!

Starting to lean towards fibromyalgia however, that is a hard one for me to except, as there is no testing to confirm. Health anxiety has me in a spiral. 

On another tangent they found hemangiomas on my spine and I know I have some on my liver too. So now worried that I’m getting missed diagnosed, cause that is a rare thing  ",1

I did absolutely spiral about possible dementia when I first became aware of how bad the brain fog is, but it comes and goes, I'm only 24, and have pretty severe anxiety. My psychologist calls it ""psuedo-dementia"" and it SUCKS, but it does get better.",1

The truth of what I still wouldn’t dare to call it my recovery (lol) is not only accepting it short-term but long-term as well.
So this means accepting, having patience and diverting your attention after accepting it.
While I still have intrusive thoughts, my body is desensitized and I work much easier now as well as having a better outlook on life. Treat it as a long battle of accepting until it finally goes away because it definitely does.",1

First of all, I want to say that this will be translated since I am Spanish and I do not understand English well, I hope it is understood in the best way.

I am Victor from Spain, I am 20 years old and I have had anxiety since I was little, on May 9, 2022 this hell began from which I am still just as bad, that day as soon as I woke up I had thoughts of harming myself, they came involuntarily and they scared me a lot since I did not know why I had them because I did not and do not want to hurt myself, I was very scared and anxious, my chest hurt, I had trouble breathing, I ate little, I slept with my mother ... I thought this would be because of a bad day and that it would go away on its own but unfortunately it was not like that, a few days after this, being in my room, from one moment to the next out of nowhere this thought crossed my mind: What if I kill my mother? At that moment I started to cry, I didn’t know what was happening to me, because I had that kind of thoughts, it had never happened to me and I was very scared, after this I decided to go to the psychiatrist to tell him about this and he told me about OCD, I didn’t know what it was but reading about it fit with what was happening to me, after a few days, exactly on May 27, 2022, I saw a news story on television about a mental illness called schizophrenia, I was in shock, it was like, I have this... At that time I didn’t know exactly the symptoms of that disease, I more or less knew what the disease was but I didn’t know the symptoms in depth, when I saw that news I entered a loop that lasted about 4/5 months which every day I read and watched forums, videos about the symptoms of this disease, I read about delusions and hallucinations, from that moment on I was aware of the noises I could hear, I tried to find out where I heard the noises to know if they were real or not. it was a real noise or a hallucination, if i was watching a video and i heard something that i thought could be outside of that video i would rewind the video to see if i could hear it again, around that time i don’t know if it was due to stress i developed floaters and i confused them with hallucinations, sometimes out of the corner of my eye i would see flashes and it would scare me, sometimes when i would go to sleep in that phase of falling asleep sometimes i could “hear” my own thoughts, it was very strange, they were like random thoughts of things that had happened to me during the day and i would get scared that they were hallucinations. There is also the other symptom that scared me, which was delusions, I read about them and after reading I noticed that I had those same thoughts but I knew they were lies, for example, I read that a delusion is an idea that is given 100% veracity even if it is proven with clear evidence that it is not true but the belief about that idea is still maintained, such as believing that they are going to kill you without having proof that it is true, well after reading about delusions I have that style of thoughts but I know they are lies, what happens is that I am afraid that from one day to the next I start to believe them and start to rave, to summarize, I have paranoid thoughts but I know they are lies, all this comes from reading about schizophrenia, I think reading about the symptoms has screwed up my head, any help?",1

 Anxiety hit me is mid 2023, one of the first symptoms was a panic attack as I woke up, felt like someone dropped a 20kg dumbbell on my chest, after that first panic attack I was never the same. 

Slowly dev other symptoms including digestive issues, I'll wake up at 3am(insomnia) n feel ok for abt 5mins, only for my body to turn up a switch and I immediately feel the need to use the toilet at 3am(diarrhea)

I had approx 35 physical symptoms or so, alot of those symptoms has resolved on their own without meds, therapy or supplements.

But till date still battling a few, such as insomnia, burning skin, buzzing body parts, brain fog(a new symptom). It's crazy.

I have Hashimoto’s, which I now know greatly affects my mood, energy, digestion, skin, and overall hormonal system. Going to an Endocrinologist could possibly help you out. If they don’t find anything I recommend learning more about gut/brain connection techniques, it has helped me out in the past.

I found several years ago, after a few years of troubleshooting, that my GI issues (along with various mild psychiatric, i.e., ""metabolic"" issues, like anxiety and depression) virtually disappeared when I tried a ketogenic diet. It may not be necessary to go to that extreme, but it is likely that cutting out wheat, gluten, dairy, and even eggs, can help.

Not sure if you've heard the story of Mikhaila Peterson curing her arthritis with a carnivore diet so I don't want to tell the whole story just in case....

It's important for people to know, though, that anxiety is as much an autoimmune condition as arthritis, Hashimoto's, or MS.",1

I used to run between 13-17 miles, wake up with high energy, good mood, and had no anxiety (I really didn’t know what anxiety was). Everything changed when I contracted Covid last New Years. Now, I can’t walk very far, maybe a mile and a half tops. I had sudden alcohol intolerance after Covid, so I’ve been sober for almost a year. I get random heart palpitations especially after eating. I developed GERD as well after the Covid vaccine. I have to go to bed at 9pm every night or I suffer a flare up of symptoms the next day. I’m always very tired, especially after working out. I have tinnitus now. I also get the WORST PMS symptoms. I get major depression and anxiety the week or two before my period, and I feel this God awful buzzing all over my body (internal tremors?) Now I have major health anxiety. Anything triggers it, especially stories about people randomly getting cancer. 

Anyway, I looked up all my symptoms and it turns out I have long covid. There is a sub here called covidlonghaul you can lookup and read people’s experiences with doctors gaslighting us and telling us it’s “just anxiety”. Which is also what I was told. If you have even had the mildest of covid infections, you could still have developed long covid. That was the case for me.",4
Anxiety,18mz0bj,ke7zgrt,"Came here to say this too. Sounds like possible long COVID. Very similar to my experience. I was running 3x/week and walking at least 3 miles the other days, on top of working, cooking, keeping up the house, socializing etc. I have always struggled with anxiety and health anxiety but I was very functional. 

Then one month after my covid infection last December, I started having heart palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, chest pain and general sense of my nervous system being stuck in fight/flight mode. I’ve had all kinds of cardiology tests and bloodwork. All show healthy results. It’s been on and off/up and down since January of this year for me. 

I barely leave my house when my symptoms are bad now. I’m lucky if I feel up for taking a slow one to two mile walk. I’ve had to take time off work and cancel so many plans with people I love. It has been the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I’ve been having panic attacks too because the symptoms are so distressing but also because I think one of my symptoms from Covid is panic attacks and nervous system deregulation. 

As others have said, check out the long Covid communities on here. People do improve and recover! There is hope!

Anxiety,18mz0bj,ke83cz0,"Yeah it really sucks especially when my whole family thinks I am overreacting and being a wimp. Basically, they think I am trying to get out of working or cleaning or something. Saying it is just allergies, just a sinus problem, etc. I have told them all I would work 16 hour days and run 6 miles a day if I had the energy and add on weight lifting too. I normally have extreme energy and they just are not used to this. I could easily work a 10 hour shift, clean the whole house, make dinner, and run 3 miles, and lift weights all in the same day.

They just are not used to me having no energy so they think I am being over dramatic. I am not - I would do ANYTHING to get my energy back. Really, I am one of the least lazy people in the world. I am a gym and work rat. Before all this happened, my husband always commented on how I never sit down for more than 10 min. Now he thinks I am some lazy bum unfortunately. I have been a vegetarian for 30 years - I would eat burgers 3 times a day if it helped - anything! I just feel like a loser and no one is helping me by saying things like - just run, just do this or that. No I am not faking anything. I despise being sick - which is why I am a health fanatic to begin with.

Good avoid on avoiding anything negative. I try to avoid all the doomsday talk as it puts me into a panic. I do not think this is a life long sentence.

Anxiety,18mz0bj,ke97mys,"My symptoms got way worse after being on Amoxicillin for 10 days. Before taking the antibiotics, I just had dizziness, sinus pressure, and the feeling like I had a bad cold/flu/sinus. The 10 days on the antibiotics were the worst of my life - did not move could barely stay up to take the pill at night, racing heart, anxiety, dry mouth, the worst symptoms I've ever had in my life. It was torture getting through the ten days. 

Fortunately, the dry mouth which was the most hideous symptom ever is gone and the racing heart, but the crippling fatigue is insane. And I still get headaches behind my eyes (migraines maybe) and dizzy at times. All tests came clear so nothing I can do I guess. I am taking several probiotics - I hope they help. Usually I am healthy - I have not taken antibiotics probably in 20 years - do not even remember the last time. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible but the sinus pressure was too much.",2

Sometimes part of what leads them to break down is because they always push through and never have any time for rest or slower pace. So it’s ironic because it could be one part of what has led you to this place is just how hard working you are!

We don’t live in a culture that values and encourages rest. It’s so unfair. I hope you can give yourself permission to listen to your body and let it rest if that’s what it needs to heal right now. You’re not making this up and you deserve to be believed and supported. 

I totally feel you on how tough it is to feel this way this time of year. It makes me sad and frustrated too that I don’t feel like myself and I love this time of year.

I feel worse going out in public especially busy stores with a lot of people. I feel faint and more tired like I need to get out quick. He said he would catch me if I fainted and that he had confidence in me that I wasn't too tired. I said that didn't change the fact that I was too tired. He said I am just afraid of fainting which is not going to happen. He said if I can move around the house then I can go in the store. I told him I can easily lay down in the house if I get tired which makes me feel safe. I feel panicky being trapped in a store with no easy way out.

 Then he says I am trying to make him look like a bad guy by insinuating that he is trying to push me to do things that I can't do when he is just trying to motivate me. as a former gym teacher, he says he is used to pushing people past their comfort levels and that it always works.

I have been to the doctor like 3 times the last month - I haven't been to the doctor this many times in a single year in like 15 years! Usually just go to the gynecologist once a year and sometimes a general check up.

I know antibiotics mess up your gut bacteria. Also, I read somewhere your b vitamins get depleted. Also someone mentioned that they mess up your hormones as well. I definitely won't be taking them again.

Anxiety,1e6ubey,ldvp3bk,"I don't need to know your age, but I assume you're young enough that you still have to live at home.  From what you've said, I wouldn't expect your parents to understand your situation.

Do you have anyone else who can advocate for you?  Parents of your friends?  Aunts?  Uncles?  Cousins?  You could make an appointment with your MD.  Assuming you're a teenager, where I live, the MD kicks the parents out at some point and privately asks you if you're okay at home, if you feel safe, if there's anything you need to tell the MD out of earshot of your parents.  You could try to work through your MD.  When you get back into school, you can talk to a teacher or a counselor.

I'm not an MD or a mental health professional, just an anxiety patient.  It sounds to me like you have anxiety.  I had anxiety for 40+ years before I was diagnosed; it started in my single-digit years.  You really do need to talk to someone to get a handle on why you have anxiety.  Being a former cradle Catholic, I'm not particularly surprised.  But hopefully I've given you an idea or two on how you can proceed.",1

Hopefully, you have someone else in your life, a good friend, an extended family member, or even a school counselor to talk to.

Anxiety,18bvszu,kc6vur9,"She is a primary care doctor and has no business to dismiss what your psychiatrist prescribed for you. He's a specialist, she is not. That would be similar to her telling a surgeon how he should do his procedures.  In all honesty, this doctor is not good. She can do more harm than good.  Run far, far away from her and get another primary care doctor.....asap!  

Also, after you get another GP, get into therapy and see what it can do for you. It's the only thing I do, due that SSRIs, SNRIs does me more harm than good.  I just stopped therapy after 9 months. I'm feeling pretty much 'normal' (whatever that is).",10
Anxiety,18bvszu,kcbeumk,"I had the exact same thing happen to me many years ago. I saw a doctor for something totally unrelated and the entire appointment was about my history of panic disorder/anxiety. They claimed that my physical symptoms I was experiencing (which ended up being a weird sinus problem that I needed surgery for) was actually just my anxiety. I was on a low dose medication at the time that was helping but I went off of it so that they couldn’t use that as an excuse to not take me seriously moving forward.

I do find that doctors are very eager to jump to SSRIs. Often times they are very helpful but your wants and needs should absolutely be taken into consideration. It’s so hard to find a therapist, much less a good therapist that’s taking new patients. Is there any way you could go sit in your car for a telehealth appointment? It was kind of awkward but my only option with my nosey family.",2

It all sounds like the stuff people throw at us all the time but I work for a nonprofit that helped me through depression and anxiety with the tools they use.

If you could do something like telehealth, do you have a car to go sit in for a phone call to make it more private? I'd love to share resources that could help but I don't want to overstep any boundaries and quite frankly the mods in mental health groups here ban anyone who shares links...

As you say, it's only been a month since your diagnosis and you have the experience to understand how to explain the issue with a medical professional. There are so many solutions and ways in which your life could turn entirely around. There will be a combination of medication and lifestyle alterations which will make a consistent positive improvement in your life. Suicidal notions can be treated by a number of medications which can make the problem light and day. 

I can personally confirm that there is a treatment path out there that can put the darkest points in your life behind you.

Anxiety,1ctkh5m,l4jflyq,"I'm glad that you're looking at crisis mediation options.

There are many ways in which people can approach problems with their mental health. When you have diagnosed depression and anxiety, typically medication is recommended alongside options such as lifestyle changes and talking therapy. As you are 16, the pathway may be different to what someone older would be offered.

A medical professional should be able to advise a sensible course taking into account your current situation. It would surprise me if they would not suggest medication given the scale of the problems you present with. However, this decision should be made by a medical professional. Given your diagnosis, I assume that you have some experience with one, the next step should ideally be with whoever that is. Do not feel pressured into a particular path that you are unhappy with, the right solution is out there. 

Outside of direct medical help, there are great resources out there for those struggling with mental health. Take a look around and always feel free to ask particular questions on this subreddit or others. Just make sure to take note of the particular rules as some have strict guidance on discussing certain themes.",1
Anxiety,1bod922,kwo5oxw,"Hi, I recommend visiting a psychiatrist. Since it's that bad, you probably need medication. Though that's for the psychiatrist to decide. And only benzos are addictive and you don't need to be taking those.

Its either this, or asylum at this point",1
Anxiety,1bod922,kwo8c2i,"Okay, this is worked with by first of all by making peace with the fact how what you're scared of might end up happening. So when you fear you might make mistakes, accept you indeed might. Same with rejection etc. And it's crucial add how it's no big deal if it happens. If you do it like that, it becomes less scary. At the same time you must not try to reassure yourself how it won't happen, that would make this not work. 

And I think it's best to visit a psychiatrist. You don't need to go to an asylum. Just visit a psychiatrist and that's it. I'm guessing in Lithuania it's free. I'm in Czech Republic and it's free here.",2
Anxiety,1bod922,kwo8qnt,"For simple matters, its free. If its something more complex, and you want personal help, its paid. While checkups are free, idk what will happen after.

Anxiety,1bod922,kwoafp5,"Alright. Well diagnosis are done very quickly by a psychiatrist. For example for me it was probably not even 15 minutes. Afterwards you'll be recommended what's the right treatment. It's usually medication if it's a disorder. At first you'll be going to them again once a month probably three times. After that probably roughly once every three months. But it's always to just report how it's helping or not helping so adjustments would be made. And a prescription. As for therapy, I went to about 15 sessions and I found it not helpful at all. I just kept going hoping it'll somehow end up working eventually, but it didn't. I was then able to help myself on my own much more effectivelly by reading up on how exposure therapy is done and then doing it. I really recommend that, it's very simple. How I described that you should accept the bad outcomes and make peace how it can happen is part of that.",2

Anxiety,1cqm2su,l3sdwgw,"I understand this exact thought process, I backed out on many things due to anxiety and it’s one of the things I hate most about it.

I feel like every time I back out, I feel like a shittier person than I would if I just went. I always feel bad on cancelling last minute and I always regret it later because instead of going out there and trying to make memories with friends I let my anxiety win. I’ve had friends who say they did get mad at me for canceling, but that was before I explained to them why. I still shut down sometimes or get agitated, but they know it’s not because of them but because of the anxiety.

Do your friends know about your anxiety? If not, I would recommend sitting down and talking to them about it. Helping them understand why you may think or act a certain way will avoid any misunderstanding. It will also let them become more aware of your situation and keep it in mind during the trip. It’s ultimately up to you, but I recommend going! It’s a short life, try to make the most of your memories and it’s ok to let your friends know if you need a minute to calm down or get back into it.",1
Anxiety,1cqm2su,l3sfhsh,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It totally sucks when depression/anxiety dictates our lives.

Last fall, I had to cancel a milestone birthday that was planned for me thanks to my depression. Some friends were going to drive down to the state I recently moved to. It was all too overwhelming for me. I would have been an awful hostess. I had to cancel and told them the truth. I also legitimately had another health problem I told them about but it alone probably would not have stopped me. Really hard to do but I was pretty bad at that time. I think most of my friends understood (they knew my history) but I think there was one that didn’t get it although she never said anything unkind.

Sometimes I’ve pushed through things and it’s been okay. Other times, all I could think about the entire time was how miserable I felt while doing it and then I’d get more depressed because I would usually enjoy what I was doing but I wasn’t.

People get sick. What if it were kidney stones (for example) or whatever keeping you from your trip? It’s a shame we can’t always talk about our mental health struggles. But I get it. 

I guess try weighing the pros and cons. Could you handle the trip? If you went and were a real “downer” on the trip, would your friends be more upset with that or would they be more upset if you didn’t go at all? If one of your friends had to do the cancelling, would you really be angry at them? Maybe you’re underestimating your friends if you had to cancel. We’re always harder on ourselves.

ETA: Do you tend to be a people pleaser?” I know I am (working on that) and find it hard sometimes to say no. Sometimes we have to put our selves first. Sorry if I wasn’t more help.",1
Anxiety,1cqm2su,l3sfvt9,"I think good friends will understand if you’re open and honest with them that your anxiety is just too debilitating at the moment for you to make it.

But if it’s going to push yourself too hard and give yourself a panic attack, you’re not a bad person for putting your health first. I’ve had to cancel on a bachelor party recently largely due to my anxiety so I understand how you’re feeling.",1
Anxiety,1cqm2su,nfps1eb,"I truly think in this situation, it’s ok to bail. If your friends are genuine friends, they won’t be mad.

So this definitely sounds like the right move for all involved, no guilt required. Got to make sure you're okay first. Maybe once you're back on track you'll look into new ways of helping people which doesn't take so much of a toll. Still many possibilities if that's a path you want to pursue.",21

I feel most accomplished when my clients succeed,  but I can't talk about it. Sometimes they feel like my own kids,  but I can't tell anyone about them.  It's a very isolating job, even at its best.  

While it is a very challenging job,  I think it's even more brave of you to leave it. It's a really hard thing to do when that's all you know. Do you have any idea what's next for you?",1
Anxiety,sd7rcl,hueywi4,This kills me as I know exactly how you feel and it makes me sick sometimes. It's so hard to think of other people when you feel like your life is collapsing and your heart won't make it.,1

Anxiety,sd7rcl,huek76g,"Thank you for your story, I feel really supported and not alone in my situation! I hope you find your ways to make your situation better, if it is possible...
Next for me comes long vacatiob without clients to worry about. I still have a small lecturing job at university, so I hope to be able to stick to it for some time until I have more energy to think and look for jobs!",1
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc1t1wl,"hi bestie i don’t have much to add about your question. however i can relate to literally everything you said. do you experience like detachment from reality and everything else as a result of your depression and anxiety? bc i’ve been struggling w that recently and dk how to get out of it. the clinical depression is WILD tbh. anyways, sending u love! 🤍",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc3t6y0,"Hey! Thanks so much for reaching out…

I definitely experience detachment as a direct result of my depression and anxiety. I remember when I would go to school last year I would literally walk the halls as a ghost because I wasn’t in my own body— my derealization/ depersonalization was at its peak then. That was the end of Sophomore year, and now I’m doing online school as a junior because I can’t handle the stressors and triggers at school. 

It was going well at first, but right now I’m changing up my medications so it’s been really hard to stay on track. Sometimes when I start new medications my body will reject them, so I’ve been off of them for a week waiting for my stomach to settle again— I have extreme emetophobia, which doesn’t help much either. 

My mental health is feeling like it did last year right before I went to the hospital. I struggle to have motivation to do practically anything… I can’t do school, clean my room, or even get myself out of bed at the moment. My therapist even mentioned today that I’m going to need a higher level of care if my mood keeps going down which I completely agree with. I just don’t want to be in a horrible hospital again, I would love it to be somewhere comfortable where they actually care about you and know what they are doing.

I’ve also lost so many of my close friends due to my isolation that started really bad last winter. In the moment, I wasn’t reaching out to them because I couldn’t handle anyone else except myself, but now, a year later I regret it so much. I’ve lost everyone who cares about me as well as create a toxic relationship with my parents. I’ve also fallen out of love with horseback riding, which I’ve dedicated my life to on a super competitive level, and it’s been really hard dealing with the consequences of loosing my horses since they have been such an important aspect of my life. 

Anyways there’s my rant, you can read it, you don’t have to, but yeah!",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc3y37s,i relate that so heavily. it’s gotten so bad for me and i’m just at a loss right now. the derealization and depression is awful & so debilitating. i’m sorry you are going through that :( i hope your new medication works for you. i’m at a point where i don’t even care ab anything and i just wanna sleep all the time. i wish the out of body feeling would go away so bad. i hope that you feel better & ik you’ll make it out 🤍,2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc486wm,"I completely agree with you… all I want to do is sleep since I guess that is the only way not to truly feel anything without you know,… dying… Anyways, I hope you start to feel better because none of us deserve to feel this way and it feels so unfair. Are you receiving help from a therapist and psychiatrist?",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc48l3n,i’m currently looking for a new one but atm no. it’s so hard to find one that accepts my insurance 💀 i hope once i find one they can help tho,2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc4o1mw,"That is so hard and I am so sorry you have to go through that. I first went through Advocates (not sure if it is only a MA company/service), and they sucked so bad. They are just a huge company that I feel doesn’t sincerely care about their clients so I wouldn’t recommend them. They require you to have your therapist and psychiatrist both from their company and you cannot just have one. So, I had a psychiatrist that I liked and a therapist that I didn’t and they refused to give me another therapist. After months of “having” a therapist that I never met with, I decided to leave Advocates entirely.

I was stuck without a psychiatrist and a 90 day bottle of meds that weren’t working for me for 3 months while looking for a new psychiatrist. I found a psychiatrist who I really like, however she’s super young it’s kinda scary like she’s not even like 5 years older than me… it makes it a lot easier to talk to her tho which is nice.

I’m hoping you are able to find one that takes insurance soon, because that search just feels never ending. You will find one that suits your needs eventually, but finding the right medication for you will be life changing. This summer I was put on one that drastically changed my life for the better, but sadly no longer feels effective now. It’s a lot of trial and error but I think worth it— I’ve been going for a year and still depressed😭",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc4p3lh,"aw that’s so sad i hate that :( i saw that ur 16 im 17, so we’re going through a super similar situation. does the out of body feeling ever go away? this whole thing was set off by academic pressure and a really traumatic breakup. it’s awful. i admire you for taking the initiative to get better tho! mental illness is SO hard to navigate and there’s not a “one size fits all” and it’s so exhausting. i want the derealization to go away so mf bad 😭",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc4qh8h,"It does eventually. I remember it would be really bad whenever I would walk into school. It would wash over me and make me feel like I was fake. Once I got medication it was so much easier for me to navigate my life without feeling like I’m in a foggy dream, however that is only when you find one that works for you. I can also relate to you with the academic pressure as I used to be a straight A student and dedicated my life to school. I always just wanted to be more perfect in school to feel some validation from my parents (didn’t even get the validation I wanted lol). I used to have such ambitious dreams about what I was going to do with my life but I’ve decided to put those back while I focus on myself. I just want to let you know that getting medication will be life-changing, especially if you experience so much derealization.",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc4r3hq,"i think i’ve already said this but idk, but i started zoloft. i’ve heard it helped a lot of people with derealization. and i don’t seem to have any other underlying mental issues (bipolar, etc) so i feel like it SHOULD work for me. and it has gotten easier but i still live in such a bad fog. like it’s actually so depressing 😭 and it does NOT helps that i was on forums where people say they had it for years. how long did it take to know that was the medication for you? i’ve almost been on it for 2 months. 

since u didn’t get the validation from ur parents, ur doing so good bestie and i’m so proud of u!! just waking up is genuinely an accomplishment. i also had such big goals and dreams but i just kinda lost sight of that in all this. i hope you find relief! i know it’s a struggle :(",2
Anxiety,18b0xp8,kc4sq5g,"Stop you are actually making me cry your words are so strong thank you 🥰 😭I feel like 1.5-2months is a good time range, but I’m not a professional so don’t take my word!!!!! That was just around the timeframe I would do with my old psychiatrist before we switched to a new one. Also, some medications just won’t work and you’ve gotta admit that to yourself. Im being so serious when I say every time I get a new medication I will go to my best friend and say “omg I have so much hope in this one,” and then the next month I’m on a new med… I have so much hope that new meds will work and then they don’t, which is really hard. I started Effexor in January, and I really liked it. It really helped me during the summer but I’m just now tapering off of it since I guess I have a tolerance to it??! Idk how it works.",2
Anxiety,1cz40xt,l5e169f,"Hey, 

I'm sorry you've been struggling. It can be so isolating and stressful to be going through this on your own. 

I was in a similar boat 4 years ago - my mental health just kept getting worse and worse until I completely broke down and had to drop out of uni for 2 years to recover. I had a traumatic childhood as well and was not coping well. 

Usually, I would recommend therapy as that is what was most effective for me, but you mentioned that money is an issue, and I know the states don't have free therapy like Canada does. There are some therapy things you can do on your own through online or book resources. For processing trauma, something my therapist had me do in the beginning was to write out my side of the story. It really helped me own my story and recognize the strength it took from me to get through those things. Writing it down also helped me realize that it has passed and that I am wiser now as an adult, and I can protect myself from the injustices I experienced as a child. 

And if you really feel like you can't keep going anymore, please tell someone. You could call or text a crisis line or even find someone at school - they should have student support services people you can access. Remember you are not weak for asking for help. In fact, I think you have showed immense strength today as you wrote out this post and asked for advice. You are so so strong, and I hope that one day, you can recognize that in yourself too.",1

Anxiety,1cuzryx,l4m1tk4,"I guess it depends on what is the type of your worry. Often radical acceptance helps. Meaning accept how whatever you're worried about might come true. And add that it's fine. It's done with sort of ""whatever"" tone. And it goes for even the most terrible scenarios. It's sort of a fake it till you make it thing, but it can start working at least a little right away.",3

Anxiety,al7x83,efd7tax,"I would highly suggest to OP to get therapy.

It took me a long time to figure out Filipino parenting tactics were full out ABUSE!

The jokes about getting beat with broom sticks, slippers, belts, sticks, inner tubes. Getting pinched, being yelled at about being an embarrassment to the family but never being taught how to act like an adult, because yelling and blaming is the way discipline is doled out.
 
Then the teasing, like they find your biggest weakness and taunt until you cry just so they can say ""why you so sensitive?""

It sounds funny when some comedian is joking about it, but when you grow up and realize that other kids didnt grow up that way,  its messes you up even more.  

Then our Filipino parents say shit like anxiety isn't real after they have done their job and completely broken us down and messed us up mentally.

Filipino moms will feed you, and destroy your soul while laughing.  ""I'm just kidding...I don't know why you're so sensitive...:

What you are going through is very real.  Anxiety is very real.  If you could flip a switch (I.e., just be positive) to turn the anxiety off, my guess is you would in a heartbeat, because nobody wants to live his or her life imprisoned by constant worry.  

Everybody is going to have an opinion about your mental wellness, but YOUR opinion trumps all others. Keep seeking the treatment that you need to get better and to live a full, rewarding life.  Your diagnosis is sacred.  Don’t be afraid to treat it as such when discussing it with other people.

And find a good support system.  Just because your mom is related to you — and, presumably, you love her — doesn’t mean she’s qualified to be a part of your support system.  I’m a firm believer in tough love, but the text transcript you depicted is NOT tough love; it’s emotional abuse.",13

I've now been an adult for a decade, and have been admitted to the psych ward twice due to suicide attempts. My mom is very accepting of me being on medicine now because she knows that I could die by my own hand if I'm not on them, but is too stubborn to admit that she said something wrong back when I first got anxiety meds.

Hopefully she understands that you love her and that you want her to be part of your life so certain topics are off limits. If she doesn't respect this descision you might need to just not talk to her for a while. This mind set can be very toxic to someone who is trying to heal.

You do is excuse ",1
Anxiety,al7x83,efdhynh,"That’s frustrating. I’m so sorry. I’ve gone through this with my own Filipinx mother. While I try not to use this as an excuse for her, I recognize that her upbringing in a collectivist culture that often stigmatizes mental health is a giant barrier for her to overcome. From her perspective, she’s endured very different experiences and obstacles (like her immigration to the states) and ultimately compared them to mine, simply viewing mine as lesser when in reality they’re just different. Like I said, I’m not excusing her, but this logic has helped me cope, keep a healthy distance, and preserve my relationship with my mother. I hope things get better and that you care for yourself first. Best wishes.

With all the counting of mail-in ballots, if in-person voting has long lines, and a certain head of state undermining the results and implying that he'll refuse them before they've even all bee counted? That's worrying even if you DON'T have crippling anxiety. Since I can't vote, either, I'm not feeling so well about all this. It's gonna be rough. Again, I just want it to be over and the results to be announced. The anticipation is the worst. But, since I can't vote and can't be a pollworker, I'm just going to try and avoid politics until the election results are announced. It's better for me to focus on what I personally need to get done right now.",9
Anxiety,jm79h4,gau7jde,"I found that I was reading the news almost compulsively, especially in like June. I felt like it was wrong of me to just shut things out and that I had to be informed, but my mental health was in the gutter and my anxiety had never been so high. I was getting really worried for myself, so I made some changes.

The first of which was to limit exposure. I now give myself fifteen minutes to actively seek out news in the morning. I'm subscribed to the New York Times and they send an email that condenses down their biggest stories so I start there, and sometimes I'll jump over to a few other sites to just get a rough idea of what's going on, and then that's it. I have to start my day from there, and I don't get to do any more active seeking out of harmful news. I also drastically reduced my social media usage, and that was really helpful in allowing me to shut out some of the noise. Just because we can take on the problems of an entire world through the wonders of the internet doesn't necessarily mean that we should!

Another thing I've done is try to do more working with my hands. It's so hard to feel in control right now, and so easy to get wrapped up in anxiety and intrusive thoughts. So after lockdown started, I committed to learning some new skills that I used my hands for, like woodworking and weaving on a hand loom. I may not be able to control what's going on in this country, but I can turn my head off (or listen to a podcast or an album for distraction) and make a table in a day, and at the end of the day that table is real, it's physical evidence of my ability to control just that one little thing. Working with my hands helps me feel grounded and gives me something to do that isn't just wearing a hole in my mind over everything.

Lastly, I started a daily stretch routine. At first it was really hard for me to get into it, and it hurt and I didn't want to do it at all. But now, my body feels really wrong and off if I don't stretch during the day. It's improved my posture and physical health, and allows me to take conscious stock of my body and how I'm feeling. Now, I can feel the physical effects of my anxiety on my body, and I can tell when I need to be more gentle with myself because I'm feeling really anxious.

Whatever happens next week, you'll be able to deal with it. Stay grounded and try to keep the focus on the present moment.",10

But things would get better as I moved throughout the day and my brain realized there wasn't impending doom.

And even if the election goes off without a hitch and the candidate I prefer wins, there will still be months, if not years of hell still ahead.

To be fair though, I'm not saying that those people represent the vast majority of their side but those people absolutely do exist and they're the ones that worry me. The other groups seem like they're mostly just idle threats and nonsense.

Edit: I also just happen to have my sisters toddler child in the house as well and baby noises are extremely triggering to me but no one in my family deals with mental health issues so they just think I'm an asshole for saying anything.

Anxiety,jm79h4,gav4tym,"I literally had a conversation about this a minute or so before coming across this post.

I recently messed with my meds.  (Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depression, 24 years.) Since I’ve been dealing with this for so long, my doctor gives me carte blanche to adjust my meds, as long as I keep him in the loop.  Before this past week,  was taking 5 mg of Buspar morning and evening, and 100 mg Zoloft in the evening, supplemented with .5mg xanax when I need it for panic.  I’ve recently gone back to work after 5 months off because of the fungalitis screwing everything up.  I felt like I needed a bump in medication because my be-nice-o-meter was in the negative.  I added 50mg Zoloft in the morning.  I didn’t want to add any more Buspar, because experience has taught me that any more than half a pill twice a day makes me stupid.  I’m not kidding, it must be what they call medicine fog, because someone cold be talking to me, I understand the words as words I know, but I can’t make myself understand them.  It’s weird.

I have been on a dose of 150mg/day in the past, and that’s actually what my rx is for.  My work week is Tuesday-Sunday, Mondays off and a random day Wednesday or Thursday off, depending on my schedule and my ability to give a crap.  I do gig work, so I work when I want to work.  My husband does it too, he has ADHD so this typed work suits us.  I’ve been feeling much better, getting out of bed is much easier, and it’s not a fight to get started in the day.  The pit of despair is more like a trench.   But tonight, I was feeling like I needed to do something, but I couldn’t concentrate on anything long enough.  I was feeling sick earlier.

I did what you should never do and googled “too much Zoloft.”  Symptoms: agitation (check), confusion (mild, but check), dizziness (Not out of the ordinary for me but no more than usual), fever (I feel warm, but I live in Texas, my apartment is always too warm, and I’m always uncomfortable with the heat), rapid heartbeat (nope, took my pulse with my phone’s cool sensor, it’s chilling at 79bpm), shakiness (check), and sleepiness (I’ve been wondering since 7pm if it’s too early to go to bed.)

Well, shoot.  I may have to choose between constant annoyance but feeling good physically, and feeling like crappy physically but having a kick-ass outlook on life.

Edit to add:  I forgot where I was going with all of this.  That’s the agitation and confusion for ya.  My husband said that it could just be election anxiety, since the symptoms look very similar.",1

Anxiety,jm79h4,gaumy4y,"Likewise. Stranded out here in Nebraska. I spent most of my young adulthood abroad, but came back Stateside just in time for Trump.

It just seems like we're headed toward an unavoidable train wreck: either the incumbent lunatic will win, and a sizeable number of Americans will (with good reason) not accept the results because of all of the fuckery we're already aware of; or Biden will win, and armed militias will take matters into their own hands. I don't know that there's a way out of this that doesn't involve conflict and widespread instability.

Oddly, this hasn't been messing with my anxiety all that much. I suppose I've adopted a kind of radical acceptance over the past several months -- something born of necessity, what with the pandemic and everything else going on. Nothing is really under my control, so I've learned to view everything through a bit of an absurdist lens -- taking the serious stuff seriously, but also keeping myself removed from it -- while focusing on taking care of my responsibilities as a citizen (voting, persuading others to vote, reaching out to my friends, etc.).

I'm not sure whether this is helpful at all, but I suspect that part of the reason that my anxiety has been steady (if not nonexistent) of late is that I feel as though my life, at the moment, has purpose. I'm one of those people for whom periods of stability or comfort are more aggravating than stretches of chaos.

Anxiety,jm79h4,gb1zkh9,"I just saw this but I wanted to give you a response. I think it's great that you're taking some time to focus on yourself and intent to start is absolutely an important component of actually starting. It's really not easy to make changes, especially with anxiety which makes us feel afraid of new things. Small, consistent steps are the key. Taking care of your body is a long con, and if you go into it hoping to see the effects right away, you'll be disappointed. What has been helpful for me is looking back to see the progress. Like I mentioned above, it's the days that I don't do any stretching that I see how far I've come in that area, not the days that I do.

Also, be nice to yourself! You're doing a full course load, plus work, plus you're managing your mental health in a time where that's exceedingly difficult, all of that is incredible!!! Don't take it for granted. What you're doing is not nothing, and if some days holding onto where you already are is all you can do, then there's nothing wrong with that.

I know some people can faint if it gets triggered bad enough. 


So since I’m underweight and now am hyper aware of my digestion happening (like physically feel it moving/cramping/etc), I’m not sure if it’s the nerve acting up or if I now have anxiety flare up’s when I eat.

I never dealt with any of it and just powered through. Then my body started hurting and aching all the time which was terrifying to me because like you, I’m an athlete and this just felt so odd and scary. Joint pain is my biggest thing right now and burning pain. I’m doing all the tests and trying so hard to figure it out but the more i look into anxiety and how it manifests in the body it makes so much sense. Especially being an athlete we push ourselves a lot usually and often i would use sports to distract myself. I think for the first time ever my body is just in pain from never dealing with my anxiety and possibly trauma I’ve had. It can manifest in our bodies so fast. Also looking up everything and being so convinced of these symptoms can actually just manifest random pains and symptoms as well because we are hyper fixating on everything and making it worse. What I’m starting to do is taking everything slow and also working on my anxiety. Reminding myself that these pains can manifest from my brain but if they can stem from my thoughts and fears then I can get out of it.

I have a few symptoms lingering, but taking into consideration, that my anxiety was there for at least 5 years, it is just normal that your body is still a bit stimulated. Things greally changed for me when i started a strict diet, training routine, while cutting down screentime aggressivley. I started cycling, resumed gym, and im doing daily HIIT. I also started journaling. I solved major relationship problems with my wife. I remember feeling better when I had the urge to go to vacation for the first time in years. When I was anxious, vacation was the worst thing that I could imagine. Being in a foreing country ""locked"" with my symptoms and my thoughts with no work to distract me, it was just aweful.

Anxiety,16rknh1,lixavbz,"Hi, How are doing, Did this help ( I am also an architecture student, Just entered 3rd year, also had a pretty nasty breakdown last sem)",2
Anxiety,16rknh1,k263kfr,Thank you for this. This is validating. I’ve been surrounded by people putting all-nighters so much im starting to think there’s something wrong with me,2
Anxiety,16rknh1,lj3eyf9,"Hi, yes. I would say it’s a necessity not to put all-nighters anymore and also have at least a day or two in each week to completely relax. I ended up not getting along with the aforementioned instructor. However, the next semester’s studio makes me realize that the problem was with that instructor because I was able to do really in the new class! And I didn’t even have to put all-nighters (I even had time to explore new places during the semester). This makes me realize if any studio forces you to put all-nighters and work with it 24/7, it’s probably a dysfunctional course because a well-designed studio will let you to do well by working smart and not about working too hard. However, I applied for a seminar course which I was rejected, im not sure if it’s because I didn’t get along with that said instructor and ending up doing just ok in her class. BUT if that’s the case then shame on the committee.

PS. I also ended up reporting that said instructor to the dean because she exposed my confidential info regarding my accommodation to the studio mates and I also reported her aggressive behaviours towards me during the term.",1
Anxiety,16rknh1,lj5q8jp,I had a pretty judgemental proff last sem. He would judge if you didn't get even the smallest details right and constantly wanted more work. I ended up being a part of his studio again ( my shit luck) .This sem has just started and I already feel terrible. It feels like every body is better than me. Also I don't even feel like attending studio classes anymore due to that constant dread. I always liked architecture though but I am not able get myself to continue doing that because of the constant dread of failing and the fear from last semester.,1
Anxiety,16rknh1,lj614f1,"Oh no. Im sorry to hear you had the terrible prof again. I understand that this kind of situations won’t make any arch student feel good. 

What I find helpful in this situation is realizing and accepting that the problem was with the prof and that you just need to pass the class. It’s useless trying to win over an unreasonable or to be good in a dysfunctional studio. No good design profs would fixate on a minor/petty detail.

Can you get a diagnosis for anxiety from a doctor and get accommodation? My abusive prof couldn’t fail me or bully me too much because I had the accommodation letter ( tho she still bullied me and barely accommodating me).

About feeling that everyone is better than you, let me tell you a secret. Every arch student does that, especially when most of them are anxiety ridden. Before I managed my anxiety, I would find every excuse to think everyone was better than me and some of them were failing. 

I can relate to feeling the dread going to studio classes. It sucks and makes the semester torturing. Please know that this won’t last forever. Once you get to a studio with a prof that’s not abusive/unreasonable, you will feel lighter.

In the meantime, get your anxiety managed. See if your school has a doctor/ psychiatrist/ counsellor/ health centre that can help you with this. You got this! I believe in you!

I’m sorry to see that the toxicity in architecture school is universal and that you have to go through the same toxic experience as I did. Please remember that you are not alone and that architecture school is full of asshole profs, asshole peers and dysfunctional classes.",1

I just want to get through this degree peacefully. I am guessing you are in 4th year now. I am glad you found a better studio that does not keep you in constant distress. Makes me feel hopeful too. How is your anxiety now btw?",1
Anxiety,16rknh1,ljab2kz,"I’m glad that sharing my experience makes you feel better and relatable! I wish arch schools would have provided a safer space space for students to share experiences. I feel like profs make us feel singled out by making us compete against each other.

But I can guarantee that there are definitely more arch students who experience the same stuff as you and I did. 

Yes! I’m starting my 4th years in around a couple weeks. Not that excited tbh lol. I hope you eventually find a healthy studio as well. Yes please! Stay hopeful. There are too many negative profs in architecture that seem to get off from putting people down and you can’t let them get into your head too much. 

My anxiety still comes and goes lol. I have to learn accepting that I’m going to feel anxious occasionally. The progress I’ve made is that it’s easier not to people please my profs or peers anymore. It’s easier to accept when certain profs or peers don’t get along with me and I no longer believe that I have to do everything right with every prof or do everything as my peers do to be successful anymore. I’ve been working so hard for my mental health and I can’t just let these people’s opinion ruin it for me anymore.",1
Anxiety,16rknh1,ljb40ph,"Yeah, these people really do take out the fun from it. Like not everyone is well equipped with all of the knowledge. Studio Proffs really assume that everybody knows everything already. 

I honestly want to make that much peace with my anxious mind so as to not have that crippling need to everything perfectly and please everyone. I am glad that you did. I think we all should in some ways. No design is ever perfect. I really neglected mental health last sem. I am really trying to focus on my mental health more this Semester. Hopefully I will achieve it. 

Is this your Final year, I have heard final years usually go away pretty swiftly. I hope it goes well for you. Where I live B.arch is a 5 year course. So 3 more year for me:)",1

Anxiety,3j3jkm,cummc6w,"IMO, needing to take a sick day for mental health reasons is no different or lesser than taking a sick day for physical reasons. I wouldn't feel bad about not mentioning that it is for mental health reasons either. You are not cheating your boss by using your sick day for mental health purposes, just as you wouldn't be cheating your boss using your sick day because you were throwing up all night or something. Also, generally your boss needs to know you are absent due to medical reasons but not the specific reasons, especially for a one off day. Even in situations where a doctors note is requested the doctors note (IME) generally does not have to include a diagnosis, just verify that you were absent due to illness / for medical reasons. I think part of the reason we have a hard time not feeling bad for taking mental health days is because MH is an invisible illness and we're still trying  to see it acknowledged as legitimate as much as physical illness is, and because people often use the term ""mental health day"" in jest when referring to taking a sick day when not being ill, but it can be a very important part of maintaining over all health.

Anxiety,3j3jkm,cumplp3,[deleted],2
Anxiety,3j3jkm,cumw773,"I was in a similar situation with my last job. Would call in sick nearly once a month. Initially I'd make up an excuse like stomach problems but once I started wearing that excuse thin I came out and told him ""I have mental health issues and I've been having an anxiety attack all morning."" 

Initially he was understanding, but after they started becoming too frequent he would give me a lecture about taking time off.

So instead, I started planning my mental health days. I'd request for a day off here and there and just try persevere until the day off or the weekend. 

After 2 years of working there I inquired about the possibility of a raise. They instead offered small ($100 /month) bonuses to not take sick days or holidays. I managed to find a new job shortly after and left.


New job has a rotating shift work roster, 4 days on, 4 days off, 4 nights on, 3 nights off. Shifts are 12 hours long.

Initially it was great and felt like a part time job, but soon the alternating shifts and forcing my body clock to change every 4 days took its toll and I noticed I was getting close to breaking down. The 4 days off between shifts was mostly spent sleeping, worrying that I won't get enough sleep or about work.

Adding to that, I can never sleep more than 4 hours during the day and I started missing meals due to how busy/tired/stressed I was and lost 10kg/22 lbs in 2 months unintentionally.

There was also never a possibility of having a sick day. There were only 4 people on the roster and calling in sick meant someone had to come in on their day off. As far as I'm aware, most of the team has never had a sick day or holiday.

I couldn't continue and last week gave my 3 weeks notice despite not having anything else lined up.

I'm more than likely going to be unemployed for a long time and my $40k debt will grow, but that seems to be the lesser of two evils right now.",2
Anxiety,3j3jkm,cum47d4,"I was lucky in my last job because their policy there was 'if you're sick you're sick' so they didn't have formal sick days.  I realize most companies don't work that way.  I'd say if you are talking about one or two mental health days a year you can probably afford to risk it.  If you think they're going to become habit you should really consider counseling to help take control of your anxiety before it impacts your career.

Also depression, but I feel that it's more of a side-effect of the above than an issue on its own.

If you aren't aware of that you aren't being realistic.  That kind of behavior isn't treatment and it's not helpful in the long term - that's what I'm calling a crutch.

I have plenty of first-hand experience with this.  I have anxiety all the time.  I was hospitalized.  I have been on disability.  It's not fun.  It can damage your career.  If you can avoid it by other measures (such as counseling), then you should really take those routes.

Anxiety,3j3jkm,cundix6,"But how do you know they aren't like that? You can just ask an interviewer ""I take FMLA because I have bad anxiety. Is that okay?"" Think about it this way. You get a job and because pretty much every job is stressful, it triggers anxiety and you go on FMLA for days at a time because you can't handle it and now your employer is out a person who they could really use and there's nothing they can do it about. It's illegal to fire someone for taking FMLA for a medical condition. But it's also a dick move on the employee's part because for one, staying at home all day and letting the anxiety just stew in your brain is no good. Working actually helps distract you. Okay, so your job is stressful? Everyone has a stressful job. I have anxiety with panic attacks and depression. I'm a work comp adjuster. My job is sooooo stressful sometimes. But I don't take FMLA because my job needs me and frankly I need my job. I need money to pay my bills and to feed myself and my husband. But if I were take FMLA and just sit at home while my coworkers are trying to handle their work and mine, I'm not going to have a very good reputation. This sounds mean, but sometimes we just need to suck it up, get the help we need and do our jobs. Anxiety doesn't have to be a life sentence from being able to be productive members of society. The more proactive people are about their mental illness, the faster they can pull themselves out of the endless void of anxiety/depression. I feel like some people think just because they have anxiety or panic attacks it means they can just cower from it and let it control them. Okay, that's my rant.

I don't go on FMLA for days.  Every once in a while, I take a day, and I'm honest about it.  My employer isn't ""out a worker"", I work with a very talented group of people, all of whom know I suffer from my disorder.  They've seen me journaling, they've seen me look awful....  Purple you do understand that other people recognize our sickness and have this thing called empathy, right?  They don't look at you as some manipulative bastard who uses FMLA to come to work whenever you want to.  

Maybe my situation is different, because I LOVE where I live, so taking a day from work actually does me a lot of good.  I definitely don't ""stew in my own brain"", I go outside and stare at my backyard.  I sit in the sun.  I listen to music.  I smoke.  I talk to my friends.

Firstly, take a breath. 

Secondly, given your age, it’s very unlikely you’re dying of a cardiac arrest. 

To ease your anxiety short term, go have another check up ask for an ECG to monitor your heart. 

From then, I’d recommend therapy. It helped me so so so much with my health anxiety, helped me rationalise bodily sensations (for example, you may learn that your heart is surrounded by muscles and nerves than contract, especially when anxious, which creates the sensation of palpitations/squeezing and is very common)

Slowly your anxiety will get better with the help of therapy. 

Wish you all the luck in the world ",1

I was honest with my new boss and I told him I’ll accept whatever the organization decides to do with me.

Anxiety,11ybz23,jd8muyn,"Congratulations!  Mental health used to be an afterthought to me.  I thought my mental health was ""okay.""  Something happened that very much brought it to the forefront.  I couldn't get control over it for 4 months (including therapy), and -- I swear, I thought I was being too dramatic -- I told my manager I needed to change my work schedule and go off the on-call rotation.  I kept thinking I was nuts for having had something affect me so badly.  For context, it was a 45-second scene in an animated television show that turned my life upside-down, but that context made me thinking I was nuts or being ridiculous.  Yes, life change can come from *anything*.

But nope, it was very much the right move.  My counselor and I have dug into many, many other things unrelated to the show.  Got my depression, anxiety, mental trauma, grief, and now emotional dissociation diagnoses in the last 8 months.

Anxiety,168kwpj,jywlaiq,"Not as severe, but same thing happened to me. I never believed in it then I got a bad panic attack in February (on my birthday), not sure why. But since then I’ve never been the same, always thinking that when I go to sleep I won’t wake up. Some crazy stuff. But I think the only way out of it is to keep yourself busy so you can’t think too much.",3
Anxiety,168kwpj,jywyrw5,"I had/have the same thing. I had anxiety my whole life but just typical anxiety stuff. Panic attack here and there blah blah blah. Then one in Nov. 2022 sent me over the edge. Exact same thing, never came back. Always freaking out, 8-9 hospital visits couple ambulances, cardiologist and lots of blood work. Nothing. Never found anything. Lost my job, waking up my girlfriend everyday crying because I thought it was the end for me. 

Now I'm a lot better but I still struggle. It's not as constant as it was before but I still get stuff like left arm pain and chest pain and sometimes start to freak out. Etc etc it's difficult. Have suddenly started violently shaking for no reason, crazy shit. 

I highly suggest you read hope and help for your nerves by Claire (weeks? Something, I forgot). Written by a doctor in the 1960s that went through this as well. Bit older but it really helped me progress. 

Backstory aside, here's what helped me; I like to have airpods with me so I can put on a tv show or something to keep me occupied if I start to feel crappy. If you start to freak out, box breathing. In for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4. That will help a LOT because most likely you are hyperventilating snd don't notice. The goal is to stop fearing the symptoms. When you fear them and get scared, your body doses you with adrenaline. Which causes fear. which causes more adrenaline and s panic attack. The book elaborates a LOT on this and honestly helped me be more comfortable with the symptoms. 

Final thing is time. I'm still not completely better snd to be completely up front with you I don't know if I ever will be but I've accepted that. I am TREMENDOUSLY better than I was. I've had my job back for 4-5 months, am able to go out with friends etc. situations can easily turn into too much for me still and I need to go home but overall, I could not imagine going through what I do again in such severity . It's fckn terrifying.  

Don't give up though. It's going to suck soooo fucking hard. Read that book and get ahead of it. It's almost 80% mental. Go to the gym if you can. I know it's scary but holy shit does it kick anxiety in the ass. That will get you better faster than you could imagine. It's going to be a horrific time, but you can do it and I believe in you.

Edit; even if you go for a fckn walk for 20 minutes. Doesn't have to be intense but it truly makes the difference",3

You're not alone and you will find a way to cope. It takes time and effort and I think that's the biggest advice I have. Don't be like me amd get lazy with helping yourself because you feel better for awhile. It's a constant effort and you can do it if you just keep at it.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksgeuop,"What kind of steps do you have to take to be prescribed a benzo? Like who can prescribe them? I’ve had anxiety for seventeen years, but only been prescribed meds for a year and a half, but in that time, I’ve tried 4 or 5. I started on bupropion but it gave me horrendous anxiety day in and day out and I gave it two months to see if it might wane, but it didn’t. Then, I tried Sertraline and it worked alright but I was still getting so anxious it made it hard to function day to day so I then tried escitalopram and it was even less effective than sertraline so I switched back to that. Once I wanted to try something else, the only option left with the program I’m using (Hims&Hers) was duloxetine. Something I should note is that I struggle to take pills in general, but I’m especially useless when it comes to capsules. I know they’re generally preferred by people but I need to be able to drink water, slip the pill in my mouth and swallow while I look down and the fact that it floated to the roof of my mouth hindered me. All this to say, I’m back on Sertraline at 100 mg. In addition to this, I have been on citalopram but that was years ago at this point, however I have been taking mirtazapine to help me sleep for several years now and it’s the only thing that helps sometimes. I’m having a really hard time finding a psychiatrist on my insurance but I really need to get my mental health in check. I’ve been unemployed for almost three months and thinking about going back gives me really bad anxiety but I need to do it to be able to work. Once I finally do get an appointment with a psychiatrist, I want to request something like Xanax or Klonopin because these ones I’ve been on don’t cut it. I don’t enjoy the things I used to anymore and I’ve developed pretty severe agoraphobia from being stuck in my apartment since I lost my job and I have this irrational fear that something bad will happen if I leave my house, even though I know it won’t. I don’t know if it’s important to mention but I have phobic anxiety centered around emetaphobia (fear of vomit and vomiting) so that’s already a challenge to live with on its own, and I developed depression about five years ago that’s only gotten worse with time.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksbpx5a,"I've also been on a shit ton of different non-controlled meds that didn't work, or made me have bad side effects. Hell, I was prescribed Xanax at one point years back and had paradoxical effects from it where I actually got agitated and angry anytime I took it and it stopped when I stopped the prescription. Klonopin has been one of the few things to kind of control my anxiety to the point where I don't feel like I'm in a constant state of panic or actively having a panic attack.

Like you, I'm on an as-needed prescription for Klonopin as well. It is helpful and allows me to work very part-time (and I can actually come into work sometimes, whereas I was having panic attacks preventing me from coming into work prior; I was even having them when working remotely). But it does make me a little tired, more talkative (I don't like this), and I do notice some memory issues in the short-term, which I really wish didn't happen. But these side effects help to make me not want to take it much more than at most a couple times a week, or I take half or a quarter of a pill when I do. I don't have any cravings or a drive to take it, but I haven't ever had that happen to me with any medication I've been on, luckily.

I understand benzos are not ideal in the long-term, especially daily usage. But there is a place for as-needed usage. Not everyone is out here getting addicted. I feel for those who do, but that is obviously not the experience of everyone who is on these medications. Seeing people literally say ""they are poison all the time in any dosage!"" is strange.",10
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksbt9sl,"I think the issue is now you have a serious dependence and if you don’t have it you run the risk of serious withdrawal. 

Benzodiazepines just aren’t safe for daily use over years and years because 

1. You build a tolerance fast and it doesn’t wane for years if ever. There’s a chance your daily use just holds off a rebound effect of withdrawal and that’s relatively soothing considering the opposite is pretty bad. 
2. Benzos are one of 2 major substances that can cause death if withdrawal isn’t properly managed, the other being alcohol. 
3. Benzos are extremely addictive for many and a lot of people are prone to abusing them. Addiction isn’t a choice people just make because it sounds so fun. 

I use klonopin for emergencies, I don’t think it’s right to completely demonize them, but we shouldn’t be using them daily for years and years. 

It’s not fun. Anxiety isn’t fun, but benzos aren’t the cure long-term. 

This isn’t me judging you, it’s just an honest disagreement. You aren’t a bad person for your medication, but I’d never advocate for daily benzo use.",13

I suddenly had crushing (and I mean CRUSHING) chest pressure from hyperventilating for no reason. I couldn’t get out of my bed, walk out of my house or drive a car without panicking (for no reason, it was entirely physical). It was living hell. I still don’t know how I did it. It got so bad I couldn’t drive to work. I stopped sleeping. Just stared at the ceiling for 3 nights straight. I didn’t eat for three days. When I got up to use the restroom my heart rate hit 198bpm and stayed there. I was googling mental facilities to admit myself. Went to the ER and they admitted me to cardiac unit for one week because my heart rate was uncontrollable. Was prescribed beta blockers and Klonopin. Took it daily for 3 years (1.5mg) and functioned normally again. Doctor wanted me to taper off and I did with horrible withdrawals. Cue daily horrific panic attacks for four years. Complete housebound. Went months without darkening the door of a store. The sound of the doorbell ringing would start a panic attack. FUCK panic and anxiety disorders. I had two children and realized I was an unfit parent if I continued that way. Stayed awake at night and cried and cried about missed playdates and how I would possibly drive them to school when it started. Found a doctor willing to prescribe Klonopin. Had a panic attack on the way there and back. I’ve been on .5mg-.75mg daily for over a year now + weekly therapy. I love my life. I run daily, fulfill my parental duties, work full-time and go where I please without panic. I’m terrified of someone taking it away. Or it not working. It would be like taking my entire life away.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,kse6cr7,"Omg fr I saw that post and when I noticed it was locked I got even more mad. I’m severely allergic to klonopin but I take Ativan as needed for my panic attacks. Without it, my panic attacks just keep going for hours and cause even more physical damage. I can’t move, I can barely swallow the pills, I shake and hyperventilate uncontrollably. I have some breathing exercises and whatnot but they only do so much. “Oh but you depend on it, it’s a crutch. Just do some therapy” ya I’m glad that works for you but it doesn’t work for everyone, at least not all the time. I do use marijuana. It doesn’t make me a drug abuser. “Ah see that’s why you have anxiety issues.” Is it? Crazy how I’ve been having panic attacks long before I even thought about using cannabis. I’ve never used Ativan recreationally either. I’m so tired of this holier than thou attitude towards people who use benzos.",2
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksbwk47,"I used to take it PRN.

I always notice pro benzo people who are offended they get stigmatized do the exact thing with SSRI’s. They talk about how dangerous they are and how doctors are greedy prescribing them. So basically they’re “ stigmatizing “ them.  If you believe something helps you should take it then quit the whining about SSRI’s. They help people too. SSRI’s are safer than benzos no matter how you try to spin it",1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l2wjwhn,Majority of these people demonizing benzos are the ones misusing it to get a high instead of actually taking it for severe anxiety/panic.

I went from 100% normal life wirh no issues to I can't even stop crying because I think every bump on my body is a tumor and my kids are always going to be sick or hurt or somethings wrong.  In 2020 I had this happen badly and doctor gave me xanax to try and poof    100% back to normal.   Used 3.5mg a day for 2 years.  Tapered off just fine and by then I was 1 year into my own small business and working 55 hours a week at my regular job.   Taking trips to Utah and more.   Medicine free no issues there no seizures not a thing.   But months later I had some spine issues ans syncope that hit to a panic attack and reset the shit back to square one.  And no doctor to re do my xanax to combat this again.   The stuff I had left over from earlier in the year lasted me a few weeks then it was day to day 24 7 anxiety and panic.   Again  normal guy to the most fearful thing you'd meet  months of trying this and that and nothing helping   therapy,  ssris... and now om leaving work early and sobbing daily  wanting to die because this shit is so painful.   Now after all these months om so far gone I start hallucinating at work that Mt kids are bot real memories anymore.  So 2 hour panic attack in my boss office he says you gotta go and don't come back until your better.. .months later and thousands in bills to try try and the only thing that has been able to send me back to work and be somewhat functional is klonopin.   No one will give the xanax    which works for me for better   klonopin at least alows me to survive a bit and work for my family needs me to pay bills.  But yea it doesn't stop the fears much.  But what am I to do.  At this point one would think I have so e underlying issue.  But no one cares.  Anyways how did trt help   I am low on test and e2.   Doctor wants to start test c.

With benzos, the substitute/ improved anti-anxiety drugs are proving to be not as effective and have the same or worse side effects eg. Gabapentin & pregabalin cause sedation, dizziness, and are highly addictive.  So will the medical authorities reverse their present stand on benzos in the future ?",1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l9mwgpg,"I have something very same - been suffering from for anxiety for more than 2 years. Tried SSRIs - zoloft, Paxil, prozac, Wellbutrin(NDRI), lyrica. I personally am very afraid of benzos because of addiction potential and withdrawals - just leave about abuse and recreation. I just need 0.25mg in morning for my day to flow - nothing else helps me. 

My psychiatrist is pushing me to restore my quality of life with a very low dose klonopin - He says it's been time that we tried and tested everything and we have not reached anywhere. It is time you took a call to stay on low dose benzo for 6 months. Most of my anxiety is subconscious - fear of fear which is embedded so deep that it comes out of nowhere. 

The other option is keep the stress levels high in body(body is always in flight and fight mode) and die of cardiovascular or other deathly mutation disease. Sometimes the choice is very hard.",1

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,lbkwfiu,"Can someone explain to me why benzos are so frowned on. I hear that you get a tolerance/dependence.. but doesn't almost every medication do that to some extent. I also remember reading that they might cause brain damage leading to dementia. But again, don't most anti depressants/anti anxiety pills are also correlated with that? (Please correct me if I'm mistaken, I believe in learning) It almost just seems that it works TOO WELL. Benzos as a whole, I mean. Plus it seems like it has to be a money thing since 30 0.5mg of clonzapan costs me 15 canadian (without coverage of ANY sort) when my new anti anxiety medication; pregabalin costs me if I'm rememering correctly 80 for 30 50mgs of it. Yes, benzos are bad for people who abuse them. But just because some abuse them doesn't mean we shouldn't use a wonder drug for people who need them. I'm just saying, feel free to disagree with me.. all a money thing. One last thing isn't a dependence on a benzo (not like pop 7 to get high). It's not a bad thing if you can always get it, right? Anxiety is a real thing for everyone to some extent. But some people have TERRIBLE ANXIETY to the point you can't do anything. No one should have to live like that. I suffer from psychosis and due to my antipsychotics, I have a new problem. HORRIBLE ANXIETY. Like, what can I do without one 0.5mg clonzapan (split dose half in the morning and the other half at night) 

But yes, not everyone should be on it. They just shouldn't be so scared that everyone is a drug addict (or doing it for money)",1

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksdo7bk,"I was the exact same way. Around 2013 in college I was overdoing it on caffeine and weed and suddenly had a panic attack. Changed my life for the worse and began having them constantly. The only thing that got me out of it was the smallest dose of Clonazepam twice/day.

I did that for a few months, then started taking it only as needed when I felt a panic attack coming on. Went down to once/day, once/week, once/month, then really never. I always keep some at home just to know that I have a parachute, but I haven't taken one in years.

The way I describe it to people who have very bad anxiety and are hesitant to try it is that it gives you kind of a base to work off of. When I started having panic attacks, I forgot how it was to feel normal. Clonazepam helped reset me so to speak, then you can build from there.",1

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksg10te,I had to taper off pretty abruptly for medical reasons and it was absolute hell.,1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksg3l0k,"I (54M) have was diagnosed with RBD in 2012 (probably had it way longer) and currently take 1mg Clonazepam for it. Other options?

I have always had vivid dreams and have acted out verbally and somewhat physically for as long as I can remember.  In fact, I also can lucid dream, which is really cool when it happens.  But the RBD is a persistent problem that worries me.  Because 1. I foresee a neurological condition in my future (my Dad passed away from Lewy-Body Dementia, and my looking back my grandfather probably had a form of Parkinson's) which I know I can't prevent 2. I worry about hurting my wife and 3. Am I destine for a life on Clonazepam?

My physical actions range from running and kicking to hitting, slapping, biting, and throwing myself out of bed.  I don't sleep walk.  The worst injury to myself, so far, is when I threw myself out of bed and busted my face on the nightstand.  The worst injury to my wife has been the bite on the back of her arm; generally the other ""batterings"" she catches as I become active in my sleep so far so good.

The clonazepam does a fairly good job of controlling my RBD but roughly 1 - 2 times a month I still experience some sort of event.  There have been times (like this week) when I have accidentally forgotten to put my clonazepam in my med box.  The good news is my anxiety and tinnitus are so high by day 2 of withdrawal that I immediately know the problem.  The bad news, the withdrawal sucks both physically and cognitively for a couple days.  I am also concerned about the long term use of it.

I've tried melatonin in the past without much affect.  Is there anything else out there that people have used to combat this besides clonazepam?  I've recently transitioned off of Effexor XR to Lexapro for reasons related to my anxiety, but I was hoping the RBD might get better since Effexor is know for weird dreams an potentially exacerbating RBD.

Thanks in advance!",1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,kssgslf,"Thanks for sharing. Knpin is probably causing you more anxiety as you have tolerance now. I have a friend( now 62) who has taken 0.5  k-pin for 25 years every day. He is alert, cognizant and creative; engaged in life. 
I, however,  have taken it for the same amount of time on and off.( Mostly on)  But have tolerance to 0.5 and vivid weird dreams every night when on it. I am also much more articulate when off k pin. 
I have a lot of experince with tapering off. I went off it once for 4 years and twice for 2 years. Every time I go back on its because I'm nervous about dating a new girl.

So it's possible  to get off if I've done it... You have too accept that you will suffer for a solid  month after taper : no sleep , walk around in surreal state like your in Nightmare on Elm Street.  Creepy stuff..and stiff muscles back, gruin pain stiff neck jaw...But...if you can indore  this,once you're  off  you will sing  in shower sing in car.. things will smell better..youl be Happy!  And no longer have nightmares. 

The worst day of detox is 14,15 when it's finally out of system. 


My most recent  I attempt  to get vlean..I went into a rehab because I had begun to drink and do other drugs after being alcohol free for 28 years. I quit in 89' AA was great to me! NA does not want to here your are on o.5 mlg of kolonopin and take it as prescribed. To them you are not clean.no at me will sponcer you..

Rehabs not the place to go to get of benzos.. because they make hideous tranquilizers readily available specifically Sariquil and Trazadone....far more sedating drugs than k pin. 

After 25k of own money..and 5 weeks at Handly center in fla.. off k pin..I could not snapp out of Sariquil fog...felt weak like I was going to fall.. I called shrink and sadly went back on..k pin

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l43t1t9,"Well alprazolam is the worst of the benzos in terms of how it will ruin your life in a few months. I took xanax for years my doc got me up to 6mg a day. My family goes to him too and my mom said I was acting weird on it. (she didn't know I was leaving my body due to the panic attacks xanax gives you even if you took it that day)

He lowered my script and said I can't manipulate him anymore. Then didn't return my refill requests. I had to go to another place to slowly use a y

The super high affinity and low half life is a deadly mix.

Your brain gets a punch to the face and calls for more benzo receptors way faster than klonopin. Klonopin has a half life of about 40 hours. Diazepam is better yet with possibility of an 80 hour half life which is great for tapering.

Id take diazepam if I had to do it daily. I'd do xanax if I had to do it every once and a while. Which is why it should only be used for panic attacks.
But, I'd vote yes to take it off the market because doctors are getting so dumb these days that they give them our like candy in large daily doses. Then you get to another doctor because an insurance change or whatever and they won't refill that anymore. Now what?
Ativan works just as quick as xanax with a similar half life. Little euphoria too so abuse of benzodiazepines might drop quick.

Tldr
Xanax should be removed or black boxed to hell, Ativan is better. Diazepam is best if needed daily for some period of time.
The withdrawal will kill you if you are not careful and do a slow taper. But be ready to save up for a year of disabilities. Find a place that will let you taper at home with a family member. Bring them into the doc apt with you to say ""I will follow the Ashton Manual and hide the pills and make sure the daily dose is correct""",1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,lfdosm2,"Xanax has a pretty short half-life around 10 hours, so it's more likely to have withdrawal issues like that after even a short time. A key advantage of Klonopin or Valium are that they have very long half-lives, more like 40 hours, so they more gradually leave your system and at lower doses wouldn't cause such intense withdrawal. And they're much easier to taper off of for the same reason, and less likely to cause addiction.",1

I take supplements to help fill any nutritional gaps. I drag myself to work every day, including my side business most other days. But the klonopin is what holds me together.

Also I've been tested by many doctors over the past decade or so for other medical issues. I've had multiple MRIs, tons of bloodwork, heart work ups, scoped both ways, etc. I've even seen a dietician and have purchased genetic tests out of pocket. I treat every deficiency and issue we find.",41

Also one thing most people don’t realise is that after years of usage, you’ll start to get withdrawal symptoms while taking the drug. You’ll get a lot of weird symptoms and will think you have some kind of disease, but it is the benzos. Eventually everyone finds out if they keep using it.

It gave me my life back. I was able to work, have relationships, enjoy traveling and my hobbies, and none of that was really truly possible without that 1 mg a day. I don't need more, I can't take less. That's the amount that plugs the hole in my brain. I have fairly severe CPTSD,  panic disorder, GAD, and I'm neurodivergent which probably has a lot to do with my anxiety, and probably part of what caused all my childhood abuse and trauma. I have a history of being used, abused, and bullied by my family members, ""friends"" and people I relly cared about. I still don't understand it except that they are toxic people. I have had doctors give me shit about my med and I finally got a good psych who understood that it was only ever a maintenance dose, which for me made life bearable. I don't have many years left and if the day comes that I can't get that medication anymore, I am OUT of here.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l6nd3ph,"Yes, at varying amounts. My psych upped my script to .5mg twice per day for more wiggle room as my anxiety had heightened due to life events and other stuff. I take really 75% of that at most in .25mg increments. I also started Nortriptyline 9 days ago.",2
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,lfavd3q,These words are so true! Quality over quantity.,2
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,mijyvwt,"Sorry to hear about that.


I actually stopped around 3 weeks ago, kind of. 3 weeks ago I stopped taking it daily and took a total of 4 .125mg doses for that week. Then the next 2 weeks I didn't take a single one, but was taking Propranolol which was newly prescribed. I had to basically beg for it. I figured the dose was low enough that I'd be fine. Sunday I had a pretty big panic attack, or on the edge of one. Thought that was the worst of it. Yesterday at work my anxiety was so bad I couldn't even sit still. I could barely sit up. I could barely think. I had to show someone a program and I was shaking inside, but I think kept my composure. I called my doctor's office and asked if I could take more Propranolol than prescribed. At that point I had taken 3 10mg instead of 2. They said they were fearful of my blood pressure, even though they demonized Klonopin a lot. They said to take it in small amounts until my appointment in a week. I was so angry at myself... I took a .125mg dose and it helped. Today was Hell in Earth again. Just shaking inside, couldn't function. Got to the point I couldn't take it anymore and took a .125mg dose again. A half hour later another one. Another half hour later a last one. That finally did the job.


Im glad I still have the medication and it works. It's better than being completely helpless. But man, it was intense. Of course I read today that around 2 weeks is when the peak withdrawal effects happen, so it all makes sense now. 


I think my issues are that I've been taking it awhile, even at a low dose. But I'm also super sensitive to meds and supplements too. I guess .125mg is like a .5mg for regular people. Not sure why.",1
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksdkz92,"Yes, there are days where I try to not take it and my dissociation is so severe I feel crazy, I feel muscle tension, I can barely think straight, I feel on edge, etc. And this is without any provocation like being yelled at or whatever. This is me sitting at my desk at work. Or even being home with the family. It's hard to enjoy life, or even tolerate it, in such a physical and mental state.


Yes, it isn't immediate, but I do mentally feel a bit better soon after because I know relief is on the way. It's like being in a bad car accident and being able to call 911 and knowing help is on the way. 


For tiredness I've tried caffeine but that's honestly counter intuitive. Now I take B12, around 2500mcg SUBLINGUAL - THIS IS IMPORTANT.  Oral tablets or capsules don't absorb well in the gut whereas sublingual absorbs quicker and better. I use a liquid METHYLCOBALAMIN (supposedly the best version of B12).

It's odd, but sometimes breathing exercises, especially while already anxious, makes me MORE anxious. I then can't breathe as easily as my chest tenses up and I can't get a deep breath. It sucks because at that point I'm trying to mitigate or avoid benzo use.


People call it a crutch but will stand by the heavy use of SSRIs and other mental health meds. While less problematic, they do have side effects. Some nasty ones depending on the person. One being increased suicide risk.


I wish cannabis worked for me. I used to smoke recreationally back in college and I felt quite good with it. Motivated, everything felt more enjoyable - from food to music to movies and more. Sadly it did end up making me more anxious. We are all different so I'm not saying thatll happen to you. I also tried medical marijuana about 2-3 years ago now and it helped sometimes. I figured since it was controlled and I knew the ratios of CBD to THC and the strains I'd be better off. Ultimately it made me anxious too often to use, sadly. It was also stupid expensive and the dispensary was quite far.",1

There is no ""underlying cause"" of my anxiety that can be resolved. It is largely genetic/neurological for me (I also have significant neurological issues that I've had since childhood).

Some people would call me crazy on here, but I've used supplements to help with my liver. My AST and ALT were high and I took Milk Thistle. Next round of labs and they were within range. Later on I did stop drinking as well. I take a whole host of supplements - around 10 per day. I add some, eliminate some, etc depending on how I feel and labs.


Since using powdered NAC I do feel less inflamed. Like many days I would wake up and go to work and I felt sick and hot, like a fever. My inside and outside felt inflamed. So I take a concoction of NAC + Vitamin C + Creatine + electrolytes (for flavor mostly) twice a day. For inflammation I also take Vitamin D and Fish Oil. Lifestyle is important too, so like I said I stopped alcohol (as well as smoking), went gluten free (for the most part... 99%, it is everywhere and there's the risk of cross contamination), went lower carb (so minimal bread, just fruits and vegetables and legumes mainly), drink mostly water, etc.",1

I take it now but never take a full .5mg per day. Lately anxiety has been high, especially starting taking Lamictal (my body doesn't like to start new meds), so I've taken .125mg 2x-3x per day. Today has been a tough day.


I've tried a wide variety of SSRIs - they honestly make my dissociation WORSE. Zoloft was the last one I tried and at 75mg I was spacing out so bad. I felt like I was on a street drug.


I more recently tried Auvelity. This is Welbutrin + Dextromethorphan. Horrible... Felt so spaced out like I was going crazy.


I am currently on Nortriptyline 25mg (unsure it does anything), Propranolol ER 65mg (not sure how much this does), Lamictal 25mg (started 2 days ago) and the Klonopin.

As for me, Xanax knocked me out. My first psych prescribed it daily and I couldn't keep my head up at work. It was too intense for me. I'd break them in pieces as well. Klonopin is more drawn out so while it can exacerbate my fatigue it's more tolerable. 


Other health issues were making me very tired, too. Doctors missed the issues I'm still working on. I had low B12 that 3+ Neurologists and many other doctors totally missed because it was ""in range"" but all the way near the bottom.

Even if you the drug works the people who have bad bad withdrawal may experience anxiety in a much more intense way than they ever experienced before ultimately thinking it's just not worth it and that it's a bad choice of medication to treat anxiety.

I understand both sides and since I've been through withdrawal I can say it's not worth it for me personally even though I totally said it was before I experienced the severity of the withdrawal but some people don't even go through withdrawal so everyone is different.

Heroin and oxycontin doesn't come close and it's well known they are addictive enough to destroy lives. Benzo is the end boss of all drug withdrawal but it does help some people and  makes some people feel like they would rather die so it makes sense that people feel very strongly about it",19

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l2u39fs,"Tolerances are different for all of us, and depends on other factors. You are lucky. Many have terrible withdrawals even coming off .25 after just a few regular dosages. Main problem is very few doctors understand it enough to have the time or energy to treat us so they either blanket bank it or blanket give it, or give so little it causes more anxiety for people when they are about to run out. Anxiety itself is the issue, and management of it needs to be more empathetic and not just blame the drugs alone which some here know their lives have been saved by them too.",6

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksb8vx2,Cool. I’m glad you didnt have to go through that. Take a little trip over to the Benzowithdrawal or benzorecovery groups to see the other side.,10
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,kse93kg,Yep. Exactly. Your brain starts down regulating your GABA receptors to compensate. So you eventually need to use more and more or you’ll start having withdrawals while using. Then when you go to quit you don’t have as many GABA receptors and it can take months or years for it to come back to normal. It’s a nightmare.,6
Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ljbwc47,Yes. Alcohol is damaging to your body and organs. I did not say klonopin has the same effect on your body as alcohol. I said it has the same effect on your brain as alcohol. Both are GABA agonist. The addiction and withdrawal is almost identical. If you dont know that then you havent been through it or researched it.,1

My mother was on Xanax for years. She had a doctor that honestly over prescribed a lot. I saw him for a bit and he shouldn't have been practicing. He prescribed me Adderall and Xanax at the same time and said to take them whenever I want. The Xanax was making me fall asleep at my desk. He also put me on Cymbalta and told me to quit cold turkey when I got heart palpitations... it sucked. She now sees my psych and they tried to titrate her off Xanax and it was awful.

A person can use benzos as a last resort when other methods of regulating through a panic attack or anxiety-induced insomnia while simultaneously working on getting to the root of the underlying issues. They coincide and your therapist works with your psychiatrist.

Anyway I went through something similar to you almost a decade ago now and was basically living off benzos. Actually worked in medicine as well haha just not a first responder. I never abused them but I didn't really get better until I got more intensive help and got more long term meds. Right now I'm on Zoloft and Lamictal.

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,ksc4m35,"Hm, well, it's up to you. If she straight up refuses it and you absolutely need them long-term, I might seek out another provider (which sucks for multiple reasons - it can make you look like a drug seeker even though you're not, and you might not have any luck finding someone understanding of your situation anyway and refuse to prescribe controls at all). It would be one thing if you were wanting them on a daily basis, but it's a completely different thing if you're very safe about it and would only be taking a pill or a half pill 1-2x week max. I don't see why your doctor would be vehemently against it, but the provider you're seeing might also have a personal bias, is following protocol for the clinic, or just does not like to prescribe benzos at all except for a very short period of time and that's it. 

I am fortunate to be in a position where my provider knows me well and trusts me, and knows my history, and is aware of what I can or can't take. This is also at a smaller psych clinic, too; I feel like smaller psych clinics have providers who have more time to spend with patients and therefore are willing to make better patient-specific plans instead of outright denying treatments.",3

Anxiety,1b0wfi5,l6y5oxl,"Paroxetine as a SSRI ruined my body over many years and started losing its efficacy. I got heavily overweight, regardless how healthy I ate (lots of broccoli, tomatoes, salads etc.) or how much exercise I did (4 times weekly over 1.000 calories cardio plus weight lifting in moderation). Stretch marks as a male as if I were pregnant. Started sweating excessively and smelled all the time. Couldn't wear a jacket in the winter time as I was always feeling too warm. Thd paxil even made me aggressive and induced changes in personality. Sleepy throughout the day. 

The doc told me I wasn't taking enough for ocd. Eat more... 40 mg, better 60 mg and the weight issue was of course my lack of control wrt eating habits. When I asked for spravato I was laughed at. 

Thanks to amanita muscaria (ibotene transferred to muscimol via cooking the powder in water with lots of lemon juice). Thank you very much to Baba Masha and Amanita Dreamer for their promotion of AM by the way. I was able to finally quit Paxil after 5 unsuccessful attempts. Each attempt before led to a nervous breakdown and restarting the paxil. 

A few months later I have normal weight again, feel good in my body and take Ativan when needed. Sometimes amanita muscaria or a dose of Ket. And seldom a beer or two to relax. Plus healthy diet. Tbh I feel much healthier this way  than in all those SSRI years and would have preferred to have never started it in the beginning. Never again do I want to take an ssri or snri.

If I take 1 or 2 mg of Ativan on a day I want to feel good, I notice how the anxiety dissipates. Then the intrusive thoughts lose their power, which results in the depression leaving. It's kind of like a card house falling together. The whole mental health issues (ocd, anxiety, depression, adhd) driven by anxiety at their core. 

Great if SSRIs work for you! That is fantastic. 🙏🏼 Mental illness is a menace and the field of psychiatry needs far more research.

I believe that it was a multi-faceted situation that caused my anxiety to spill over into panic attacks and therefore change my life thereafter.

If I've given up on therapy why did I start therapy with a new therapist a month ago? That makes no sense. You're seeming quite foolish and myopic right now. Not surprised.  My last therapist had to stop treating me due to a job change. I didn't drop him. And i couldn't spend $150+/week to talk to him.


Alcohol doesn't have medicinal properties. Well, some wine may be good for you but that's really it. I'm also on the LOWEST dose and have been for years. There are days I break it into quarters to minimize its usage. I go by how I feel for the most part. I don't abuse it. I dont even find it enjoyable, I just find it helps me feel more normal.


Weird how you're so against people feeling better and then making vast uneducated judgements about them because they've tried everything else and it didn't work.

We're open to discussion and differing opinions here, but claiming that heroin is safer is outright ludicrous and your comment of taken on board by anyone would be far more problematic for them then the Ops views.

I don't blame you for not wanting to take SSRI'S. I hate them things. I tried the Celexa and had tons of side effects, so I tapered down to 5 mgs. At least the side effects went away. I can only handle them in low doses and I may not get the best results, I feel like I get some results without the side effects. There is a study that advocates for low dose antidepressant therapy. It says that with Prozac, 54 percent of people will get a good result with 5 mgs. While 64 percent will get a good result with 20 mgs.

Anxiety,u3vpge,i4s5yhq,"Hey, I kinda stumbled onto this when looking up for depression. It actually all stemmed from my heart health anxiety. 

In the last year I've been getting frequent ectopic beats aka PVCs or PACs. The doctor told me they were called benign PVCs and they are common. Some people just get them. I've always had the odd one here and there but since last October I've been getting 2-3 a day. So I went to a different doctor to get a different opinion and she told me that there's no treatment needed. As long as I wasn't fainting, dizzy, chest pains or passing out while I was still working out then I was fine. But for my peice of mind, I decided to get some blood work done and Holter monitor to see how many PVCs I do in fact get per day. I'm still awaiting results. But as anxious as I am, I noticed I've become more and more stress and depressed. 

Since then my PVCs have gotten better and they have subsided but I'm dealing with other health issues. I noticed since this heart scare, I've been walking around uncoordinated and clumsy. I have slight involuntary jerks and I think it's psychomotor agitation from the depression. 

The ectopic however did subside since it's been 3 months since I've quit all stimulants (smoking, vaping, coffee) they had suspected that those were the main culprits. I have also discontinued my low carb diet due to possibly low electrolyte balance even though I take my supplements when on a low carb diet. I've been sleeping more hours, doing more light cardio and drinking alot more water. The heart isn't the issue now.

But eventually it caught up to me and I was dismissed from the university with only 3 classes left (two of witch I had failed before because i just never went to class). 

After that, I was pretty lost and wasn't really sure where I would end up. I just sort of drifted around and eventually got job working night shifts. Then about 4 ago I hit rock bottom and my anxiety was at its peak. I was having panic attacks all the time, and it really made me realize what it was that I wanted in life. My anxiety mostly manifested as health anxiety and I was worried I would die before I was able to do the things that I wanted to do. 

This however was the motivation that I needed in order to start rebuilding everything. It ultimately will be a slow process that will take time, but I will always be me, that intelligent person that created those great opportunists in the first place. I can do it again and will always have the potential to accomplish all the great things that I would like to.

Remember there is a reason you were able to get where you are now, and there is a reason that have been given all of the opportunists that you have now. It is because you are capable. The road wont always be easy, but you will be able to manage simply due to the fact that you are you. Not sure will be the best help, as it took me hitting rock bottom and thinking that I had reached the end to truly see it. But hopefully some of it will come through. 

Lastly I would just like to add that during my two year break from school, I was able to affirm my true interests in my field, and have spent a fair amount of my personal time studying it. School and work aren't necessarily the only places you can achieve great feats of science and math.

My collegiate path, transcripts, and ultimate outcome... are ugly.

But I still found a job that I polished into a career that's fulfilling and pays well. 

It may effect you, but it will not ruin you.",4
Anxiety,5i2dom,db5tybj,"I was the exact same way in undergrad, almost ten years later what I wish I knew was that nothing was going to be ruined that I had a lot more time and chances than I ever knew. 

Basically nothing was ruined except for me worrying all the time that it was. 

If you break things down into small bits, say even writing the to-do list is too much just getting out the pen and paper, etc etc it can help. 

But also letting people know that you might need some help in the here and now. I really wish I had let my professors know that I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression. Some even asked what was wrong, I was too stubborn to let anyone know. If I had told someone I could have had more time for papers, an understanding of attendance issues and more. 

Also, find and fight for a way to take a break from whatever is the most stressful thing. Maybe it means you really take the Summer off or you don't do much for Winter break in a big way. 

I fought myself so hard and I eventually got my MA and a good job that I really like. It just could have been so much easier if I would have been a little bit easier on myself and had let people help me. 

Also, keep working on the meds---sometimes feeling cloudy is a sign of withdrawal (if not taking on a good schedule) or too high a dose. You'll get it right and it will have to be tweaked every now and then for a while. 

Most people have something like this at sometime in life. I understand how much it sucks at 19 when there is a lot on your plate and you feel like you have to do everything. This is the BEST time in your life to take a step back and work on things, don't give into the twenty something twenty everything ideas. 

You got this",5
Anxiety,5i2dom,db57vlv,"Same, same. 20/f who got perfect grades freshman year, and have been gradually failing more classes over the last couple years. I do all the things - eat about as healthy as I can, go to a counselor, walk to class when possible, got disability accommodations, started only taking three classes at a time, the whole 9 yards. Still have been struggling to do the very basics in my classes. 
I'm just now coming to terms that my anxiety is causing literally all my problems. Since I feel like I've tried everything now and it hasn't been getting better I'm trying to figure out if I can take a gap semester, or what I can do to get on track somehow. I tried beating myself up over it, but I'm realizing that does nothing for me and just made my anxiety worse so I'm trying to figure out ways to trick myself into doing my work. 

If there's one thing I've come to terms with in the last 4 semesters, it's that struggling in classes won't ruin the rest of your life. There's a lot of creativity that comes with grasping at straws to keep your positition. Professors keep assuring me that having to retake a few classes isn't the end of the world, even when it feels like you have a lot to lose. That being said... I'm still not 100% convinced I'll ever be happy or successful, but I think that's the depression talking. ",3

Being depressed and anxious has made it so hard just to get myself to eat, let alone get out the door and learn anything in class. I'm losing hope that grad school could ever be an option for me, if I even manage to finish my degree.

I spent so much of this semester doing all the things I could to try to improve. I took up exercise. I went in for weekly counseling. I tried a variety of medications. All of that has made me stable enough to not kill myself, but not stable enough to be able to do any of my school work. I feel like such a disappointment.

It's hard, though, because I know that even the bare minimum is going to be a pain to get.

And as an adult i only just got Medicaid and the 2 psychs i emailed to try to make an appointment never replied back. 

Finally this year was the year i let myself slip. Up to like 15k debt now, i used the rest of my credit to upgrade my van before moving into it. And have been living in it since September. At least I'm job free. Any time i try to feel good though i suddenly get really anxious about finding money and the spiral of thoughts that involves and then it concludes that life sucks and I'll probably have to get a job or end up truly homeless so i might as well kill myself now while i have the means before the pain of being homeless happens. 

I could be doing so much more than laying in bed in my van all day at Walmarts if whatever mental issues didn't ail me. I suspect adhd-pi, depression and anxiety.

Like, i literally believe that i can out-think my anxiety and depression that has lasted my whole life. I literally believe it right now as i type this.


The funny thing is, im only ""strong willed"" when i talk myself out of needing help. But that will is nowhere to be found when im suffering from anxiety and depression paralysing me in my steps. Ive been a hermit for 2 entire years now. Depressed that im overweight. A d yet 2 years is plenty of time to lose weigjt. Thats 52 weeks. At least 52 lbs each i could have lost. So why am i upset over somethint i could easily fix? Why am i paralysed by anxiety?


I also went to engineering school, finished, then went to grad school. I blamed all my anxiety on school. But then, 2 years of unemployment, initially time i took off on purpose to ""work on my mental health"", and im literally worse off than when i was giving graduate level presentations to a room filled with way smarter ppl than me.

This says a lot about how you were treated in your past, I suppose your family, but anyway this is very significant and the reason you are thinking these things is because it’s what you were taught and you have internalized these things, you have taken them upon yourself.    


I wouldn’t be surprised if you discover that you don’t overreact at all, you probably are very astute but were taught that “you’re too sensitive” by people who treated you badly but didn’t want you to realize it and they want you to think that what they do is normal so therefore, it’s on you, it’s your problem, “you’re too sensitive”.

Some sessions are really hard, I’ve come out of some appointments bawling my eyes out, but stable enough to go home, because of what we talked about. It’s really hard and it’s a hard mindset to get into but stick with it!! Getting help was the second best decision I’ve made in my entire life.",2

Well done for reaching out to a therapist, I know speaking to one definitely helped me a lot.

I recently started documenting my own journey living with anxiety & my journey on overcoming it on YouTube. Feel free to check it out, if you're interested:

Both arent helpfull and I do try to remind myself of that but I tend to get stuck in a surten thought-pattern sometimes that's exhausting to break through.",29
Anxiety,hqlsf8,fxzs440,Something that I learnt from therapy also was that just because people have it worse doesn’t mean your problems aren’t valid.,17
Anxiety,hqlsf8,fxzuxsq,Definitely. A lot of mentalities instilled in childhood have to answer for a lot of my problems lol. I keep discovering more and more as I grow up,7
Anxiety,hqlsf8,fy04k3e,"Getting over that mentality was the first step for me when I began my mental health journey years ago.  I had to accept the fact that I had been mildly emotionally and physically abused as a child before I could let go of the guilt I felt for being angry ""because it's not like I was abused or anything"".  I remember the first time a therapist said, ""but you were abused"".  It was such a shock to my system.  But when by accepting it, I validated my own hurt and anger that I had been holding onto for years and was able to begin working through it, rather then trying to find a way around it.  Now I have a great relationship with my family.",8
Anxiety,hqlsf8,fy14ek9,"I agree.  Insensitive people often open communication that way.  “How are you?” [insert your six alarm fire with IED evasion survivor experience] “Well, we are all going through something!”  Why the blueberry French toast did you ask ME then?

Anxiety,hqlsf8,fxyu00u,"What would you define as a long waiting list? 
When I tried to go through my insurance (teacher, US) it was the beginning of february, and the earliest they could get me in was may 5th. 

Fortunately my employer offers a separate, free 10 sessions, through a company, and I was able to get in much faster. (within two weeks, which I consider as fast as humanly possible in the US)

*Side note:* 
I've also seen a lot of people I know who are lucky enough to have access to counseling/therapy through employers, or some other means, but often don't take advantage of it because they feel like 'there are people out there who need this more than me.' or that they're 'taking up a spot'.

Anxiety,hqlsf8,fy1fnoj,"Having the right therapist is so important. It sucks that you have to choose between one you can afford and one you like. 

20 USD sounds like the lowest copay you'll see in the us. I may have had a copay of $15 once when I went one time through my insurance a few years ago after a break up. 

For reference, what else would you buy in India for 1500 INR? I Can see you're worried about the expense but I just can't wrap my head around it because $20 seems SOOO cheap to me.",2

Not to the mention the additional people who will have developed some type of mental illness throughout lockdown who are seeking help too 😔 I’m fortunate enough to be able to afford it and, similar to what you’ve just said, I’d rather leave the free appointments for someone who can’t",3
Anxiety,hqlsf8,fy1gv8h,"Ummm...it's quite expensive,like a normal physician charges are anywhere between 100 -400 INR. If u want a specialist like an ENT, Cardiologist costs u around 1000-1500. So yeah 1500 belongs to expensive margin. And our health infrastructure is opposite to the one in US. There everything is done via an insurance company right. Here u do yourself. It's just lately ( I mean in this decade or so) people invest in insurance fairly. Or else don't do. To answer your question as to what one can buy for 1500, not sure how to answer that. But for someone who belongs to a middle class family yes 1500 is a lot...  I aim to take three sessions per month so 4500... But yes lately due covid,expenses have increased, my father lost his job so I have to pay for everything. So I have to think twice for the sessions. I sometimes take  2/month. And not to mention when people don't support u taking sessions ( coz they are expensive) :( .. I wish they understood it's tough to start over...I am seeing this doc for over an year now. And to start over...it's :((

PS - General physician who can easily treat almost 80% of your health problems charge 100-400 INR.....and for mental health its 1500 per session.... I am sure there would be ones who are cheaper it's just I haven't checked coz I don't want end up comparing and thinking should I shouldn't I? Not knowing is right now better for me",2
Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv27qdb,"I think that you still sound like a great mother despite the circumstances. Plenty of kids watch a lot of TV, but I think as long as you’re even attempting to take an active role and play with them, then you’re doing amazing. I know you may be reluctant to, but also maybe consider reaching out to friends or family who are willing to help.
You may feel like they deserve more, but also keep in mind what you’re going through. Also, they’re 2 lol. I don’t remember anything about how my parents kept me busy when I was that age. As long as they’re loved, which they are, that’s all that’s important :)

Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv42uda,"Hi. Mom to two kids here. Crippling depression and anxiety, so you're in good company. Lol . 

I don't talk about this with anyone but, I struggle hard. There have always been ups and downs over the years but this time of year is never good for me (I'm in Canada, winter is dangerously close, and the days are shorter.) In stressed, and stress makes it worse. I lose my temper. I feel like a failure. I'm impatient. All of those things. 

Last winter was pretty awful for me for a lot of shitty reasons. My kids watched way too much TV and played way too many shitty videogames, but the alternative was ugly, for all of us. This summer I put them on an electronics diet. 

My point is, you will never be perfect. The situation will never be perfect. You just make survival your priority, and when you can do better, you do.",1
Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv293r2,"Thank you for that! I appreciate it. I hope my kids know they are loved and feel seen. My daughter sometimes says “I feel sad” and that breaks my heart! What am I doing that makes he feel sad?!? 🥺

I no longer have any outside support at all. We moved at the start of the pandemic while pregnant with the twins to be closer to family. Long story short, my family let me down big time and I have since realized how they actually have done so my whole life. Becoming a parent myself made me see how much my parents failed me. So that has been a lot to process alone. Moving also meant we lost contact with people we knew before - and my personal patterns of creating relationships with “takers” meant I was too exhausted as a new parent to support those relationships. So now we have nobody except my kids, husband, and myself. It’s like extra gut-punches when your already down.",2
Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv273gl,"Thanks for the response. I do try my best, I just know what my best is at the moment is severely lacking and that hurts. 

PPD is postpartum depression. It’s typically diagnosed sooner after delivery, but I just got diagnosed. 

I am married. My husband actually helps a lot and is very understanding and helpful. I’m a stay at home mom and he works full time from home. He does all he can to help, but he has a lot on his plate too. I just didn’t mention him because I feel like these feelings and failings are about me and not him.",1
Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv2aaig,"Thank you. Being the best mom for my kids is my biggest motivation. Sure, I want to be a better me for myself too, but I know how to function in empty. But that’s not the mom they deserve. I’m trying so hard to be more. But I’m so worn out and it’s hard to have the energy to take care of myself on top of everything. But I’m trying. 

My own mom was not very present in my childhood. I’m just now coming to terms with how little she saw and did, because she was “nice” and seemed loving. But she was negligent in a lot of ways. (I’m only now starting to recognize and unpack that myself.) I desperately don’t want to be that for my kids. I want them to always feel seen and grow to be who they want to be, not who they need to be to find acceptance from those who should unconditionally accept them. I hope even if I’m a crap mom in other ways that I can still give them that at least.",1

Anxiety,ym5nzd,iv2any4,"That’s too bad :( I feel like maybe your kids notice you’re sad, so it might be more of an empathy issue. If not, as long as you’re trying to help, I’m sure it can’t be too bad. Considering there’s no support system around you, I would maybe consider therapy if you can.

Anxiety,ru1pc8,hqwen0b,"Wow I have a similar story to why my mental health has gone down hill. I’ve had A LOT of trouble finding someone and I also have a form of anxiety that makes phone calls almost impossible. I put petty phone calls off whenever possible. It hard for me to even order a pizza. It is embarrassing. My mom also died suddenly…in my home…in sept…in my 12 yr olds bed 😞 
In June my anxiety took over to the point I couldn’t eat or function. I ended up in the hospital for 4 days for hyperkalemia. My levels were literally to where so could die. My mom was still alive then but upon being sent home my mom was off and I refocused on her. Hospital and docs found nothing wrong. She died 3 months to the day. 

Anyways, I think that this stupid war on pills is INSANITY. People need them. If I have a xanax(like you- low dose) I am fully functional and supermom. I get more done in a day than a normal month. But doctors think it’ll be addicting. 
To be fair Idk if they actually believe that or just know they have a huge burden when they rx them. 

I am a single mom. This has been so hard and I wish it was as simple as being able to say “this is what works”. 

I was just put on an antidepressant for like the 3rd time in my life. It’s not depression. I really wish that there would be a change in this country. The govt constantly changes their opinions. Deaths from fentanyl are higher than covid. Why? Welp my guess is majority of people were taken off their meds and are not buying illegal meds and don’t know wtf is in it. Not everyone wants to get high they just want to function.",2
Anxiety,ru1pc8,jenx9vo,"Therapist with anxiety here 🙋🏼‍♀️
First of all, I’m so sorry that you’ve experienced such shitty therapists.  I’m not even exaggerating a little bit when I tell you that my jaw was on the floor reading through the outrageous behavior you’ve experienced through the people whose job it is to provide you a safe place to heal.  The grief therapist that yelled at you for “causing her more work”?!?!?  Seriously???

My best advice to you is this - find someone who not only specializes in anxiety, but has it themselves.  If they have never had a panic attack or been unable to eat or sleep due to their anxiety, they’re not going to really truly understand what you’re feeling.

I wish you well, dear poster.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but some days it’s damn hard to find.  Keep searching until you find it, because once you do, it’s so worth it.",2
Anxiety,ru1pc8,hqweup9,Thing is these doctors and specialists dont have an anxiety disorder or anything so they dont know how we feel. So they prescribe us what they think will help which sometimes doesn't. Alot of them dont care and some do. Have mental health problems is rough because they're not doing enough research on it. They just want to drug you up and hope it does something,1
Anxiety,ru1pc8,hqwrs5h,"Oh God! I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Grief is horrible especially along with an anxiety disorder. We are living in fucked up times my friend. When I was first given Xanax in 1996 I was terrified to take it. The first pill I swallowed actually gave me anxiety as it slowly slid down my esophagus. Then suddenly it was like a switch was pulled. I felt normal for the first time in my life.

All the worrying thoughts that spun around inside my head quieted right down. The heart palpitations were gone. The gloom and doom was gone and I felt ""even"".

I was told Xanax was very safe and effective. I was also told I would be taking it for life just like a diabetic that needed insulin or someone who had high blood pressure needed blood pressure pills. When I was pregnant I was taken off of it and then my anxiety and panic got so bad that I couldn't even hold food down or even eat without vomiting from nerves.

Instead of gaining weight I was losing it. I kept ending up in the hospital because I was so dehydrated and malnourished, that the doctor said the benefits outweighed the risks and so I was put back on my meds. I had two healthy children while I took a low dose of Xanax.

Now the bastards say ""Xanax is no longer safe for long term use"". WTF?! It is like getting the rug pulled out from under you. Being med resistant and only having one that works for severe anxiety and panic getting taken away from you is a horror most will never know. I am finally lucky to have found someone who will listen. Most doctors are arrogant and will not listen to their patients. They act as though they are superior and that the patient knows nothing about modern medicine. I know my body. I know what is effective and they just do not want to listen. Instead, marihuana is being legalized in almost every state, but you have to beg to get a Xanax for a serious mental condition.

My own best friend got hooked on weed and is a shell of her former self. She cannot even make a coherent sentence anymore, but weed is okay the government officials say. Every other week she is getting into a car crash and smashing up people's cars while taking edibles. It is turning into bizarro world. I was told by a few practitioners I could get a legal weed card and take weed for my anxiety. I don't want to get high! Getting high scares me. I don't even drink for God's sake, but yet I am treated like an addict for taking Xanax when I get a panic attack and a God damn psychologist won't even treat me because of it.

I bet if I smoked weed or took edibles that fucking bastard would give me therapy. I am beyond pissed. These therapists suck balls. I cannot find one that is decent anywhere. Not even one. I spend every single day calling and seeking out someone that could help and am getting nowhere.

Picking up the phone and even dialing has my heart palpitating, my hands sweating and me stuttering as I leave voice mail after voice mail hoping and praying someone will call me back and nobody does. I keep getting the bullshit excuse ""Due to Covid our practice is filled up and is no longer taking new patients, blah blah blah"". The only ones left on my health insurance provider list are the shitty ones that I mentioned in my original post. The rest are too filled up with patients to help. What also scares me is if someone does call me back, what if they end up just as bad as the former shitheads I had? Most of these people are now only recommending mindfulness and mediation. That seems to be the new flavor of the month for mental health disorder treatment.

I was prescribed Xanax and only take it on very bad days. I stop myself from taking it even when I need it, because I am so afraid it is going to make me feel better and then the latest practitioner who is finally giving it to me will swipe the rug out from under my feet and no longer give it to me. Then I will go through another 3 years in misery trying to find someone else who will prescribe it. I have stockpiles of it that I don't take when I should that I hoard because I am so fucking terrified of losing it again.

Every month when I need a new script from her, I get nervous as hell expecting her to say ""I am retiring soon"" or ""Let's lower your dose"". Antidepressants don't do shit for most of us, yet they want to jam that shit down our throats or give useless meds like Buspar to people like us. Sometimes you even get stuck with doctors that drug you up with shit that makes you like a zombie so you do not complain and stay out of their hair.

I get so desperate to talk to another human being with empathy and compassion that I call suicide hotlines just to have someone to ""listen"" and help calm me down from a panic attack. I have phone anxiety, so calling is no small task for me. I also hate picking up the phone calling because what if someone who is trying to kill themselves gets a busy signal because of me? I learned my lesson. If I am lucky enough to get another therapist I will not even tell them I take Xanax. I do not need to be abandoned again. These jerkoffs think we are drug addicts for taking Xanax. This is beyond fucked up.",1
Anxiety,ru1pc8,jeo3vhy,"Thank you for the compassion. It is really hard trying to feel hope when the people you think are there to help you, destroy your trust. I appreciate you and thanks for your comments.",2
Anxiety,ru1pc8,hqwuekz,"You nailed it right on the head. They have no clue. If they even had one panic attack I bet they would shit their pants.

They try to dope us up with fancy, expensive antidepressants that just don't work or exasperate our condition. They don't want to give the old school meds that work anymore because they are so cheap and generic. 120 .5mg Xanax costs me $22 out of pocket with no insurance. The drug companies are no longer making money off of it. So now, they demonize it and every student of psychology, social work or MD is being told  it is ""dangerous"" and ""highly addictive"". Because of junkies and people that like to crush it and snort it up their nose to get high, I had to search for 3 years to find someone to prescribe it to me, while I turned into a full blown agoraphobic from not having it anymore.

A big problem is now everyone and their mother on social media says ""I had a panic attack"" and now it seems like people with real anxiety and panic disorders are just being dramatic. Anxiety disorders are not taken as serious as they once were because everyone says they have anxiety when it is just normal everyday stress. Those people annoy the shit out of me.",0
Anxiety,ru1pc8,hqynn2e,Yea alot of people do it for attention. They have no idea what real anxiety is. They google it and self diagnose and think they have something when they dont,2
Anxiety,y31a7w,is5ytqp,"If you dont rely on this job for income I'd say you're better off quitting. You shouldnt have to tolerate a job when if its undoing all the work you did for your mental health during the summer. I also dont get why your therapist said its an ""avoidance"" tactic when its the complete opposite. Either way, your mental well being comes first and if this job is not doing well for your mental health the best option is to quit",9
Anxiety,y31a7w,is626hd,If you already have a job and this is just a sidejob it's stupid to keep at it if it's making you miserable.,3
Anxiety,y31a7w,is666hf,"I think it's a really difficult line. I honestly think I would find *any* job stressful on some level but if I responded to that but just not working that would probably count as pretty unhealthy avoidance. That said there are going to be plenty of jobs which I'm not suited to or where the workplace culture is really bad and unhealthy.

If you don't think your job is objectively bad then it might be worth sticking with it for a while and looking at which parts of it are stressing you out and what you can do to reduce those stressors?",3
Anxiety,y31a7w,is7c75p,Some battles don’t need to be fought. Staying at your job is one of those battles. This job is clearly bad for your mental health. Quitting would be the right decision. You are facing a problem head on and doing what you need to do to take care of you. That’s far from avoidance. I think your therapist should be supporting you and initiating conversations about what kind of job is going to be a better fit.,3
Anxiety,y31a7w,is8iuow,"When I was in the same boat with my previous job I sought therapy and the first thing my therapist said to me was “have you considered leaving?” Walked out of therapy that day and applied for 3 other positions within my organization and ended up getting one that I absolutely love and am way happier and less stressed at. He told me he doesn’t care who I have to disappoint if leaving my previous job would make me happier and less anxious. Long story short I think that sometimes there’s more strength in walking away from things that don’t provide any positivity, than trying to stay and make something work. At the end of the day, like you said, you have to do what’s best for you!",3
Anxiety,y31a7w,is9a9d3,My therapist told me that I ruined my career after I told him I resigned my job because anxiety is ruining the fuck out of my life and that anxiety is ONLY because of that fucking job.,3

Was off work for 2 months bc of my mental health, started back, and went straight into old habits (anxiety attacks, not sleeping, self-medicating etc) she wants me to stick it out for at least 3 more months to 'practice being more assertive' and use it as 'a tool to work on my self-esteem' but I literally feel myself getting worse by the day because of this job lmao.",2

Anxiety,y31a7w,jhor9a1,"So I have strong feelings about this because as soon as I left this job (which I did a month or two after this post) I felt so much better. I wound up having the time to start up an etsy shop which I have always wanted to do, and my mental health almost immediately got better. A big part of the reason I was so stressed at my job was because my co-worker who’s twice my age was essentially bullying me and making it a very hostile environment, and you can’t change other people, so I knew that it wasn’t going to get better. 

I like my therapist, and she has helped me through a lot of hard times, but this was something that now knowing how much it helped me to leave, I can confidently say she was wrong about. I agree that on some level it could be considered avoidance, as there’s steps I could have taken first to try and address the problem with my co-worker, but on the flip side, I think it is also very important to realize when you are in a situation that is not good for you, and leave it. There is literally an endless amount of jobs in this world you can get, and chances are you will find one you like better and that will be better for your mental health.

Anxiety,svx03d,hxjlni3,"I have the exact same problem. I've never related harder. Health anxiety absolutely kicks my ass - for the past few months I've been in a constant state of anxiety, first about my shoulder, then my heart, now my brain and spine, literally any tiny thing sets off my anxiety. I spend hours looking up symptoms too, even though I know that makes it worse. I always convince myself I have all these diseases and jump to the worst conclusions. Even having gone to the doctor and been checked out for a lot of things it hasn't helped me one bit. I will say though it feels sooo much better being on here, hearing peoples experiences and realising a lot of people are going through the same thing as me. Talking to people who know the struggle really helps. Health anxiety is an absolute bitch, because you can't escape your own body or have any control in what happens. And the panic attacks that come from it make you feel like you're on deaths door, and the stress gives you physical symptoms, which causes more stress, which causes more symptoms, which causes more panic attacks. It's a vicious cycle. Currently awake at 5am here having not slept a wink and had a panic attack earlier because I've convinced myself I've got the most rare and serious side effects from the antidepressant I've been put on.

I dont have much advice because I'm in the same boat. I have always been prone to anxiety (specifically health anxiety) but itsgotten a lot worse recently. I'd say speak to a doctor and they might request some basic tests that could reassure you enough to help the pain go away (that's if it is caused by anxiety). Then if the pain doesn't go away or the tests show something up you can take it further. As for the day to day worrying about it though, just know that you're not alone",2

It feels like I’m losing my mind with this vertigo and I’m doing everything I know how to do to help - meditations, therapy, seeing docs and running tests. I know I’m not dying (sooo many tests) but the vertigo is horrible. My body and brain are in constant panic because they think I’m falling or sinking or spinning. 

I see a neuro-ontologist in a week to see if they can figure out how to help me and I’m doing physical therapy as well. Also trying different meds (Zoloft made me feel worse).

I’m scared… like really scared. The vertigo disorder isn’t my anxiety, it’s something in my ears or brain.  Since this happened, I’ve been a basket case and hate my life.",2

He can’t be a good partner or boyfriend to you if he can’t work on himself first. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for him but I imagine he did with the best intentions for you and him both.

I always ask myself ""have I felt this before?"" and go along the CBT line of logic - yes, and it's never been anything serious, all my tests are normal etc etc, and ride it out. And once you do it once, you know you can, even if next time it feels just as serious.",7

Day to day anxiety related to stress causes those chemicals to fluctuate, but it’s not a permanent issue. That’s why “anxiety” is not always a diagnosed disorder.

My anxiety falls into the categories of hypochondria, death anxiety toward myself, death anxiety toward family members, intense bouts of paranoia (home intruder, stalker variety), OCD checking of everything (where things are placed, if emails were sent, papers were filed correctly, location of important personal items like bank cards, ID, passport), and just generalized anxiety as a whole. Now, I usually don't experience ALL of these types of anxiety at one time (thank GOD), but I'll usually be dealing with a few. And, say, once I get over the hypochondria fixation I have for the time being, it's like, hey, let's replace that suffering for a few months with the intense paranoia of being murdered in a grocery store! I can't stand. Actually cannot stand it. But we're not alone.",1

Anxiety,12htep6,jfrua89,"This is not pathetic at all. I'm a 22f with BPD and anxiety and I had to take 2 years off from uni too back in 2020. It's really scary to feel lost on what to do. 

You said you've done CBT in the past. Can you draw on that and try to challenge your thoughts? Can you find evidence for why you think there is something wrong with you? Then can you compare them to the medical evidence and see if your thoughts match up with reality? 

It sounds like your body is generally feeling unsafe and is constantly in the stress response. Are there things you can do to tell your body that you're safe? For me, I like using my weighted blanket and sitting in the corner of my room with the lights turned off. Or maybe, do you have a comfort playlist or movie you could watch? 

For sleeping, I recommend listening to sleep stories or sleep meditations and trying to focus on that as you fall asleep. When you don't have the proper coping skills to keep yourself from spiraling, bedtime can be a really scary time. Having a bedtime routine that includes a relaxing activity has been really helpful for me. 

Good luck!",2

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uqo8y,"My process was actually really odd and drawn out - mainly because of some factors that complicated it.

So, technically speaking,  I was diagnosed when I was 18.  At the time though, it was a diagnosis that was done/made in the middle of going to doctors to get disability for unrelated reasons.  They said I had anxiety and severe depression - which we went home and laughed off, since I had actually gone through a pretty traumatic break from all my friends two months prior and hadn't gotten over.

I ended up not thinking anything more of it.  I started college a few weeks later.  A few semesters in, I decided to go to the counseling center because I was struggling with my classes and motivation.  They actually didn't end up diagnosing anything that time, but did note my high level of anxiety.

I stopped going after about a year, until 2012 - I ended up going through a lengthy traumatic experience (Three to four months in duration.)  and had a meltdown at the beginning of the fall semester that made me decide to go back to the counseling center.  Within about two sessions my counselor asked me to meet with the prescribing psychologist on staff.

I did so, and she ended up telling me she and my counselor had gone back through my history, including my first stint with the center.  She said she suspected I had Generalized Anxiety, and wanted to put me on a medication for it, if I was willing.  Of course at the time I would have been willing to do anything, so I accepted and she contacted my PCP about getting me on citalapram.  It ended up doing wonders at the time, and ultimately confirmed her suspicions.  I ended up going through them for two years - until I graduated college finally.

Of course, then I have a second possible diagnosis of depression and a third suspicion of PTSD - both from my therapist I've been seeing the last few months since the anxiety had actually gotten a lot worse due to a job I had early last year, and it had steadily worsened after I quit - I finally got on state insurance again and was able to get in, and am finally starting to feel somewhat better.

Generally, I think Anxiety is the right diagnosis.  I've wondered if I possibly have depression as well, and that was something I'd brought up to my current therapist when I first contacted him - but I don't really have anything to confirm it currently.  The PTSD - I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we did the proper testing, etc and confirmed it, but I can't say one way or another if I agree with the suspicion.

It actually was a relief - the original relief came from knowing I wasn't crazy or just overreacting to situations for no reason.  The current relief is from having it affirmed that the GAD has in fact worsened for the reason I think, that it isn't insurmountable and that now we are looking at the root causes of it - that maybe we can start treating it properly.

And wow.  This is a lot longer then I originally meant it to be!  Sorry!",7
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2usy28,"I had some serious stuff happen with my kid (it's on my post history) and I was up waaaay too late with anxiety thinking someone was going to do something similar. I went to a psychiatrist because I was pretty sure it wasn't something I could just talk out of. She eventually said that I have manic depression with disassociative tendencies and paranoia disorder. I was/am on Zoloft although it's brought down a lot since the beginning. 

I feel it's a pretty accurate diagnosis, but life is changing so it can always change.",4
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uwkgi,"I knew something was wrong, so I went to the on campus Doctor. I was 18 and living away from home. Poor as dirt with no insurance. During an attack, the nurse measured my heart rate around 160. I had been sitting very still in the waiting room for a while, so she thought this was odd and told me to see a cardiologist. My wallet laughed at her.


Fast forward through a few more episodes, and my mom finally suggests it might be anxiety since my grandmother had it. I started seeing a therapist through a church and it started getting better. He retired, but my attacks had decreased, so I thought it was ok. 


A semester or so later, they came back HARD! Like almost dropped out of school hard. I went to the campus clinic again and set up counseling appointments (which were awful). I also went to the infirmary and they gave me the equivalent of horse tranqs (atarax) and a Prozac scrip. That got me through college. 


Once I got a real job (with insurance!) I decided to get off the Prozac because one particular side effect had to go! My new GP was the first one who wanted to rule out other causes. He sent me to a cardiologist where I had a 24 hour heart monitor, EKG, and sonogram. Once those tests came back clear, he prescribed me a less debilitating emergency medication, I stopped taking the Prozac, and I started seeing a REAL therapist (who was excellent). 


Now, I only occasionally need the emergency meds, and I haven't been to a therapist in almost a year. I still have stumbling blocks, like yesterday. But I'm glad my GP ruled out my biggest fear.  ",5

I don't to be labeled with something because then it means I'm crazy and that I am debilitated!!!!!"" but now I just see that those descriptions I've made about me having anxiety were the works of mental stigma. For me, seeing that I have anxiety is actually comforting knowing that there is a term for what I'm feeling and that I'm not crazy, I have a mental illness.",4
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v0yhf,Go to Mexico where the doctor was not a pussy to give a straight diagnostic.,3
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uu4iv,"My process was pretty quick and easy. 

I saw a psychiatrist, because I misunderstood what a psychiatrist did. I knew they prescribed medications, but I didn't realize they didn't also do therapy. If I could do it over again, I would go to a therapist first. 

I just took my insurance card and dug around until I found an adolescent psychiatrist whose picture looked trustworthy (which is not scientific at all), and made the call. They fit me in pretty quickly, and I went to visit.

I had a diagnosis after my first visit. Generalized anxiety and panic disorder. My psychiatrist sat me and my parents down and talked to me for a while to find out what I was experiencing, then talked to us separately - my parents alone and then me alone. Then we all came back together and she told me what she thought I had and wrote a prescription for Lexapro, which as actually been really good for me. 

In general, I am  happy with my diagnosis. After a lot of research (like a lot a lot) I think I have depression as well, but that's pretty common with people with GAD, so I haven't brought it up with my psychiatrist.

It has been a really huge relief for me. It makes me feel really good to know that there is something to call what I am experiencing, and that it isn't just me being weird. 

I think the thing I struggle with is the eventual time I will have to go off of Lexapro (which I want to do soon) and whether or not I will transition back into having panic attacks or if I will be okay. It's not the diagnosis or the current state I'm in, but the future.",2
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uujw3,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder by my counselor at my college, who I had been talking to weekly for about 8 months. I always knew I had depression since middle school but grew up with my parents vehemently denying it since they came from a culture in which mental disorders are extremely taboo and hush hush.

She went through the DSM-V with me, as she said all professionals diagnose based on the manual. I had 8 out of 10 symptoms and felthe extremely validated. Now I knew all those scary moments when I wanted to end it all, the countless days I spent stuck in bed without eating or drinking anything and the times I nearly cried from trying to force myself to go to work weren't just me being lazy as fuck. 

I went to a doctor and got medications immediatrly. I was also diagnosed with ADHD with my doctor through a short questionnaire and talk, and with depression again with another questionnaire. He acknowledged my anxiety but said it most likely stems from my untreated ADHD (he was right, after taking my ADHD medication most of my gripping anxiety disappeared. Whatever was left is currently bring experiemented with my depression medication). Although my doctor does not have any connection with my counselor and doesn't really know what I've been going through or thinking, he's been a great help and we've been working together for the past month and a half to adjust my medications and finetuning my prescriptions. 

Honestly, I'm not too ashamed about my diagnoses, but I definitely don't tell everyone I meet. I have told most of my professors to explain my many absences in class, but I definitely felt bad doing it because I didn't want them to think I was trying to make an excuse for not doing everything I was supposed to. I am so happy that I had the courage to finally seek out a medical professional because I now have more energy and care for my life than I've had in months. ",2
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uyp66,"I knew I was depressed for a couple years before I finally told a health professional, for reasons I can't really remember now. At first I thought that everyone lived their lives in the constant state of anxiety that I live in. Once I realized that wasn't true, I was too scared to go.

Maybe four years ago I was in college when I got sick and had to go to the campus doctor. She was asking me some basic questions and I was hinting at my depression when she finally asked me if I was depressed. This was the first time anyone professional had ever asked me and I told her I thought I was, but that I'd never been diagnosed. She gave me a prescription for Zoloft and set me up with a consult to be diagnosed. For some reason or another, I never got the prescription filled. I remember holding on to it, ""just in case"" style, for a long time. Well after it expired.

The guy I went to asked me a bunch of questions and was really kind and funny. That's when I got diagnosed, officially, with GAD and depression. He set me up with a therapist (who I stopped seeing after the first session- she was patronizing and made me uncomfortable.) so I was officially diagnosed but not receiving any treatment, again.

I went to my home town to see a doctor to get medication, but he wouldn't give it to me unless I could come back to my hometown every weekend for followups. My home town was three hours away and at this point I didn't have my driver's license- it was impossible for me to do that. I was with my Mom in the car and I just totally broke down sobbing. I remember how frustrated I was because I thought the medicine would finally make me feel better and I still couldn't have it.

I had transferred colleges so I went to a therapist recommended by my roommate who finally put me on Zoloft, which I started for good. I had some of the pretty normal reactions to it and have had issues where I've been on and off of it cold turkey at various times (which you should NOT do, holy shit, do not just stop taking your meds no matter the scenario), plus I'm on a medication to help me sleep. 

Generally my diagnosis is GAD and depression, but one therapist explained it the way I have it listed in my flair- I'm so anxiety ridden and I worry so much that I depress myself, which seems about right. Anyway, that's more info than you needed, but my diagnosis and subsequent treatment took years and multiple doctors to nail down, so if anyone out there is feeling discouraged, please just keep pushing. I promise you it's worth it.",2
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v58ne,"I talked to a therapist with my mom and cried a lot (I'm a huge cry baby) and she was like ""yeah, you should see a psychiatrist."" See the psychiatrist, same thing, talking and crying, diagnosis. Fairly easy considering I suffered like 18 years before getting help",2
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uwkwh,"The only thing I have been officially diagnosed with is A.D.D. the TL;DR version of it was my stepfather pressured my mother to keep taking me to various child psychiatrists for a few years until one would agree with him and prescribe me a sedative amount of medication. I looked it up and found the dose they gave me was more than three times the dose normally prescribed for kids my age and size. 

Turns out I just needed social interaction and was cooped up at the house all day and he was the first person I saw after school & he refused to drive me anywhere most of the time & didn't want to deal with me. I was incorrectly diagnosed. When I was 19 I quit cold turkey with no ill-effects.

But then a bizarre mix of parental and spousal abuse, rape, homelessness and other pretty traumatizing events has left me kind of shell shocked. I am not the person I was then. I don't believe I've ever had A.D.D. but I have a textbook case of CPTSD and am very anxious going outside or interacting with people a lot and worrying to the point of staying up for days. 

I don't like the label of having A.D.D. because if I was excited about something people would ask if I'd taken my medicine (especially my stepfather) and I felt as though I would never be able to function without the $90 a month subscription. On the other hand when I get diagnosed for any number of my mental afflictions after enduring some pretty traumatizing events for so long, I'll have better access to the right kinds of care services and proof as a legal cushion. (If people scare me especially from behind usually at work I end up on the other side of the room shaking, crying, smashing into a wall trying to get away and realizing I have struck the other person and I'm terrified someone will sue me for assault or something)

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2ux0t1,"I went to my doctor and told him that I had been having panic attacks  randomly a few months beforehand and he had diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and prescribed me with Paxil and Xanax. I took the Xanax for when I was having an anxiety episode, but not the Paxil because I was worried about side effects.

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2ux2wz,"Military service is mandatory in my country and I didn't feel capable of being trapped without any privacy for 4-5 months in a place full of people I didn't know and with whom I'd be forced to interact daily.

So I went to a psychiatrist and I told him that I didn't feel like it was possible for me to do my military service. We spoke for two hours and some week later he sent me a full report that I had to give to the army. I read it and he had diagnosed me with a social phobia and an obsessive-compulsive disorder with obsessional thoughts or ruminations.

It was a really big relief for me. First of all because the army decided that I was unfit for military service but also because it felt like I was taken seriously. It forced me to accept that I wasn't pretending and that what I had felt for most of my life wasn't just me being weak or making up problems.

Now this doesn't make living with this disorder any easier but it's definitely a huge step forward to know that what I'm going through is a recognized mental disorder and that solutions exist.",1

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uxstr,"Took around 2 years. Something very emotionally traumatic happened to me when I was 16 and from that time onwards I kept having this feeling of ""not being able to catch my breath"". The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I couldn't properly fill up my lungs with breath, and even when I took a deep breath it felt like it was stopping just before I could properly finish it. It got worse and worse and eventually I went to the doctors and had a solid 2 years of physical tests for my breathing and lungs and they just couldn't find anything wrong with me. I had asthma when I was younger and I think it really slowed things down because they just kept coming back to the asthma. Eventually I went to Uni and decided to see a doctor up there because it was getting really bad, he immediately told me it was anxiety and was shocked that no one had diagnosed it before. He was a cool guy.

I was definitely correctly diagnosed and had a lot of therapy (CBT) after that which really helped. I remember leaving the doctors office after the diagnosis and just walking down the street really confused as to what was going on tbh. I still had this really strong feeling that I couldn't breath, but apparently it was all in my head.. Was a very difficult few years after that. 

But now, I'm almost 23 and it's basically gone apart from the occasional bout of anxiety! ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2uy59t,"My primary physician diagnosed me when I was 19. I never thought I had any sort of mental health issues growing up. I thought that what I felt was normal. I worry constantly to the point where I am sick from it. I had anxiety attacks as a young teen, but I thought everyone had that! It took me YEARS to finally get the courage to see my doctor about it. It took me so long to explain to him what my issue was because I was crying so hard and I was in his office for two hours. Got diagnosed with GAD and dysthymia. The depression is often triggered by anxiety, but it's not a frequent occurrence in my life. Anxiety is an everyday thing for me.

Sometimes I feel diagnosed, sometimes I don't. I can't afford to see anyone else other than my primary physician, and he can only do so much. 

I felt awful getting a diagnosis, but relieved at the same time. I never thought that there was something wrong with me, and I never wanted to ""be one of those people."" I felt like I was crazy. I felt like I was being a hypochondriac. It took me a long, long time to accept it, and it's still hard for me to accept it. It has taken me awhile to actually take my medication regularly, because I would take it for about a month, I would start to feel better, then I would stop taking it because I felt ""cured"". I never accepted until this YEAR that the bad feelings don't go away, and I'm just about to turn 23. 

I really opened up to my boyfriend about it and told him exactly how I feel yesterday, and we have been dating for almost two years. He knew that i had GAD, but he never knew the extent of it. It was so hard for me to open up to him. We live together and he has seen the ugly face of how anxiety affects me. Lately, I've been having 2-3 anxiety attacks per week, so I had to just lay it on the table for him so he could understand. I am just lucky he is so patient with me, haha. ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v013f,"So I was diagnosed about 2 years ago, straight after I had 2 massive panic attacks in a row. Saw my university counsellor first, then my doctor on the same day. Both said what I already knew (that it was extreme panic/anxiety).

 Doctor offered to put me on meds but not vallium as it is highly addictive. I declined as I thought I was tough and didn't need medication, this was just a one time thing.

Couple of months later I'm having a week full of anxiety for no reason at all. Go back to doctor and she diagnosed me with generalised anxiety- puts me on Escitalopram 10mg.

I'd known at this stage that I'd had panic attacks on and off, but I didn't know that I'd been dealing with anxiety my whole life.

Once I started taking my meds I noticed that I stopped doing a lot of things I considered to just be a part of my anally retentive nature- obsessive germaphobia, locking doors multiple times, having a very controlling nature etc. 

It was at this point that I thought I should see a therapist. So I did my research and picked a neurotherapist with 15 years experience.
I found him through Google and his website had a booking system, which I found handy as I hate talking to strangers over the phone.

Had one session with him, he confirmed what my doc had diagnosed me with, but through discussion he revealed that I also had perfectionism and a fear of vulnerability (amongst other stuff). I honestly never thought therapy would work, but everything he said made sense to me- it was an absolute eye opener and it changed my life for the better. 

Through the whole process, I liken my being diagnosed to the stages of grief (kind of)- at first I was in denial, then I tried to raltionalise it by saying shit like 'oh I'm stressed because of X, it will go away', then I was in an acceptance stage for a while- I kept going in and out of acceptance because the people around me also had difficulty coming to terms that it was a legitimate illness. 

Once I explained it to my family, they became more accepting of it, but my mum would will make jokes like 'oh, you're not right in the head'.. And this was her way of coping, but it sucked ass- I just grinned and bared it because imo my mum needs serious therapy herself...

The hardest part was when I started seeing my neurotherapist. My mum doesn't believe in seeking help from others, nor does she believe in therapists. She thinks it's a load of bullshit.
Nonetheless, I am lucky that my family is supportive- but it was really hard to discuss issues with mum because she kept making jokes about it. 

The thing I hate most (which I still get) is when people ask me when I'm going to get off my medication (not my parents, they're nurses, so they know that what I'm on isn't harming me). It's mostly my MIL and randoms..like this one doctor I had to see because my usual one wasn't in to fill my script for me.

As far as I'm concerned- if you're not on the medication and you're not my regular doctor, stop asking me when I'm going to get off the meds when you have no fucking idea what it's like to be me. 

I guess you could say it is a relief to know what I have, but more relieving to know WHY. I find it much easier to control anxiety when I can sit back and examine it. ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v02cm,"Mine's sort of atypical: I got tested by a neuropsychologist for my learning disability after it was recommended by my teacher and my signs of generalized anxiety showed up on the report.

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v2hsw,"I started seeing a psychiatrist for depression in 2005 after having a small nervous breakdown brought on by my GP upping the meds I was on - Celexa I think - to a level that was too high (side effects were noted to be severely increased depression).

The psychiatrist started treating me for depression + anxiety in 2007 or 2008. I was put on Cymbalta but stopped it and went back to just Zoloft at my request because I felt like it took away all my emotions, not just the bad ones.  

In 2011 I moved and switched to a new psychiatrist. Since 2012 I've been on a daily regimen of zoloft and ritalin. I'm officially diagnosed now with - severe depression, anxiety, and adult on-set add. Overall the med combo works pretty well. I still get anxious, but I feel like I have power over it instead of it over me. 

After my experience with a well meaning GP over- prescribing, I STRONGLY recommend anyone with depression, anxiety, etc see an actual licensed therapist and/ or psychiatrist. 

As an aside - I think the ritalin is causing me to have hair loss. It's a rate side effect but my step brother (also a psychiatrist) suggested I talk to my Dr about it. ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v4lj8,"I had to make an appointment with a therapist and I was told the test would take four hours. I finished in, like, an hour and a half. There are some stupid questions on it that didnt make sense. And then my parents each had to take the same test where they assessed me.

I was really looking forward to my diagnosis because for two years, my doctor had been trying to treat the illness I had without knowing what it was. So this resulted in tons of drugs that wrecked my body and is kind of still wrecking my body/liver now, but that's a whole other thing. 

It took about two weeks to get the results back and my therapist sat down with me and walked me through the results. My therapist was terrible, so he told me I was pretty much lying on the test and that if I actually felt the way I described, I wouldn't be able to function or I'd be dead. Funny. Anyway, I was diagnosed with social anxiety (which I knew I had) and dysthymia or chronic depression. He told me there was significant evidence I had generalized anxiety disorder, paranoia and OCD, but he refused to diagnose me with any of it. 

I stopped going to that therapist and now that I look back on it, I feel if I were to take another test, I'd get some different results. Maybe mostly similar, but I think there would definitely be some changes.

I'm not completely satisfied with my diagnosis since I think it might be more. He said dysthymia rarely had suicidal symptoms and that that was more of a major depressive disorder thing, but I was terribly suicidal for about three whole months to the point of almost going to the hospital. I don't completely agree with the diagnosis, but at least I have one on paper to show my doctor or whatever.",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v5m58,"My diagnosis was a bit of a mess. 

When I was six years old, I had a panic attack while I was at the movies with my mother and aunt. I described feeling like I could be in an open field and still feel claustrophobic, like I could scream but no one would hear me because I had no voice. Right then and there my aunt said that I had anxiety. This made no sense to me because I didn't know what anxiety was (aside from situational anxiety, like before tests or whatever). I dismissed it and forgot it existed. 

Skip forward two years, my mom took my sister and me to a therapist. He gave me five minutes, told me I was too young for my problems to be serious, and kicked me out. Skip forward maybe five or six years, I told someone that I felt depressed, she reported it to the school counselor, and the counselor pulled me out of class, stopped me in the hall, and basically interrogated me. Then she took me to her office and sat down with me and wouldn't let me leave unless I started talking, which I refused to do because I did not want to talk to her. She kept me after school and eventually called my mom so she would know where I was. 

At this point I hated therapists/counselors/etc and never wanted to see one again. Skip forward a few years, anorexia is a thing, eventually the guy I was dating told me to go to therapy and after arguing for a bit I begrudgingly accepted. The therapist I went to specialised in eating disorders and though she was great and helpful and had good strategies... she wasn't right for me. However, on our first appointment, she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression, and anorexia. She referred me to a psychiatrist, I went there, and she gave me meds on the first day. 

I was sixteen before I was offically diagnosed. At first, I thought it was just depression, so when my meds didn't fix my depression (but did help my anxiety) I was unhappy with them. I do feel like my diagnoses have been correct and I accepted them quickly, and that's one thing I suppose I can help that therapist for. Though she didn't help me learn to cope she did help me get meds so it kind of worked out. 

Now that I have a label... I don't know. It's kind of a double edged sword. Not knowing what they were, I was trudging through life, forcing myself past all the hard shit but I still struggled, a lot. Being able to name them.. it helps, knowing that these things are not normal, knowing that I have something to blame for the stupid way I feel about some things. But sometimes I think I use it as an excuse in places it doesn't belong, and I think I am more fragile now. ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2v6mao,"My story is short. I was in therapy for about 6 months. I went through a bad depression and was admitted to a hospital with suicidal thoughts.  Spent a week in the hospital and left with the diagnoses of bipolar 2 and GAD. When I went back to my original therapist, she thinks it's more BPD which I agree with.  So I have a ""doctors diagnosis"" and then my therapist one.  So yupp. ",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2va45k,"I don't ever remember. I was very young when my anxiety first manifested. My parents took me to a psychologist at the recommendation of my GP. I don't remember being told the exact diagnosis, since o was maybe 5 or 6, but I assume the psychologist did an assessment and would have told my parents.",1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2vcgwz,Stopped sleeping entirely for up to 4 days at a time last summer.  I also went to the ER twice because I could feel my heart beating and couldn't sleep and thought I was dying.  I got diagnosed with GAD and put on numerous sleeping meds and an SSRI and doing much better now.,1
Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2vmna6,"I have recently been diagnosed as having OCD and Anxiety by my GP. My OCD started when I was 12, following a burglary at our home. I started to become obsessed with checking that doors and windows were locked, that the cooker was switched off etc. I would check multiple times; both physically and visually. My rituals became part of my daily routine. If I didn't do my checking, I'd become really anxious and wouldn't be able to focus on anything else. I guess I no longer felt safe in my own home. 

I have completed my rituals every day for the past 15 years, but over the last year things have become worse. I started a new job which I love, but it has made my ""symptoms"" worse. Safety and security is a massive thing at work, and I find the number of doors and security procedures very overwhelming. I stress over the tiniest little things, and very rarely go home without worrying about something. I constantly worry I haven't done things like locking doors, signing for something, logging out of my computer. It has become a daily occurrence, and I've been struggling to sleep as a result. I get irritable, I cry, my chest gets tight, I'm tired constantly, I don't socialise. I spend my whole day worrying about something, and it is affecting my daily life. I've even started doing my rituals at my boyfriend's home. 

No one likes to admit there is something wrong, and I mulled things over in my head time and time again before making the decision to visit my GP. I just decided that enough was enough and that there must be more to life than constantly worrying about things, and making myself ill. My GP was great. He made me feel so comfortable. I told him everything; the things I do, and why I do them. He didn't judge me, and didn't think I was silly like I thought he might. He was understanding and gave me my diagnosis. OCD and Anxiety wasn't really a shock to me. I guess I kind of expected that outcome. We discussed treatment and I opted to try medication. It's still very early days for me, as I've only been taking my tablets for a couple of weeks now. However, I am proud of myself for acknowledging my problems and searching for a solution. Work have been supportive, and a colleague even tells me that I have locked doors etc. I can then focus more on what they've told me, rather than questioning myself. I feel I've taken a step in the right direction and hope that things can only get better moving forward.

Anxiety,4i3fv8,d2vq4p4,"it was long but also comforting in a way to find out that i wasnt going crazy (for now ha).

it started with my family asking me to go to my GP, eventually i did, i was terribly depressed and having panic attacks and told him this, i told him i felt like i wasnt me and everything seemed different, that i was getting worse and dont see how i was gonna get out of it. straight away he tried to throw pills at me, but i refused, i was afraid they would change me more, he asked me would i like to see a psychiatrist, and i freaked out thinking i was gonna be locked up in a mental health hospital. i had a panic attack there but he calmed me and i eventually said yes, mainly to just get out of there.

3 weeks later i got a phone call and i had a friday morning appointment. for those 4 days up to that i was a mess. thinking i had schizophrenia, bipolar, u name it i thought i had it. multiple panic attacks a day and couldnt eat. that friday i got a lift there and didnt say a word for the 25 minute drive, but inside i just wanted to die.

i sat in the waiting room with all the other people there and felt out of place. my name was called and i met a man who asked how i was and the first thing that popped into my head was to tell him i was fine. he then asked me lots of questions, am i hearing voices, hallunicating, what are my moods like and alot more, then he just told me that they were standard and then just asked me simply, whats going on anyway? i told him eveything, how i was, what was happening me, all about my panic attacks, that i felt like something in me was making me feel like i was vibrating, that things seemed odd, like i was unfamiliar to places i had been before and so on. he just wrote everything down and asked me would i like to see what he wrote, i had a look and then asked him what he thought was wrong with me, he said he needs to no more but that i am definetly depressed, asked did i wasnt pills and i said iv changed enough as it is and then he said i should try cognitave behavioural therapy and that he would be in touch.

the coming weeks i went to cbt, and after a month i was giving another appointment with the psych, i went and it was a completly different person, basically asked me all the same questions as the last one n had all my notes and cbt files there, he asked me was i doing better and i said i was a small bit and then i was on my way.

then cbt for a few weeks n then a psych appointment again. this was about 5 months from my first appointment with the first psychiatrist. i met a woman this time, she was very serious. it made me nervous and she say that and told me that she doesnt bite and laughed. she asked me how i was, and i told her. she eventually said ""well now its time for me to tell you what your official diagnoses it"", she told me not to be worried. i was. she then said i had generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), a panic disorder, and moderate depression. for the first time in 5 months i relaxed a little. she gave me a big talk about medication, which i said no to and eventually it ended with a zanax prescription and that i didnt need to see them again and to continue with cbt and i was on my way.

i saw my cbt through till the end and still never took any medication. the cbt helped in a big way for me. the lady i did my cbt with said if i ever need to come back just let my gp know and they will set up an appointment. that was over a year ago know but im doing a lot better than i was, but still have me bad days here and there, on really bad days i think that im going crazy and they got it all wrong, but on my good days i laugh at the way i thought and that its just anxiety.
thankfully im having more good days then bad lately :)

I am so sorry that you have gone through a lot of rough patches and that being diagnosed has been such a drawn out process for you.

I'm glad you are on health insurance now and were able to work with doctors to better understand what you're struggling with and how to better manage it.

Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibgzq6e,I myself look into things deeply sometimes and maybe it’s your subconscious’ way of saying that a certain thing about you is what could be “dying” but not actual death itself. Maybe it’s where the old you “unhealthy” is now gone and represents a new beginning.,3
Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibgxxgs,"I believe in ancestor messages, but even within western psychology the concept of your subconscious processing information or helping you resolve problems is not unheard of.

It can be really common in your 30s to get this kind of anxiety as we begin to notice the effect of our previous lifestyle choices in our body or as in your case we lose a parent.

I don't feel like it was a bad omen if it has prompted you to take better care of yourself, more like a warning, either from your ancestors or from your subconscious telling you to fix up and look sharp.

Best of luck with your journey to better health!",2
Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibgx7qb,Are you getting treatment?,1
Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibhgo1h,"Stress can do wonders for our subconscious mind. It literally rewires how we think. Seems like you are a spiritual person, have you tried spiritual counseling? There are many spiritual aspects in eastern medicine and sometimes it really has a major effect on some folks. 

That being said, why are you so worried if it’s reversible? Had your grandmother told you, nope it’s certain, I would completely understand. But if even your subconscious mind or your grandmothers spirit told you that you can avoid it, then I would focus all of my attention on recovering, rehabilitating, and getting healthy. Not focusing on whether death will strike. 

It helps to take your mind off of negative thoughts, it helps your body too. My best advice is to think positive and focus your mind on what you can do to get healthier. Take your mind off of what worries you. Easy enough to say, I know. But that’s really the first step. Acknowledge what has happened, acknowledge the message, and focus on the positive aspects of your dream. How about taking a trip to your grandmothers resting spot and thanking her for the warning. Good luck to you.",1
Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibhxc2f,CBT therapy has beena  life saver for me for PTSD and severe Health Anxiety.,1
Anxiety,v6r6bk,ibihdz9,"It's really tough to feel what I'm going to share now since you're depressed but bear with me a little. What you experience is not ""life"" per se, what you experience is actually your own emotions mainly. These emotions are created by your thoughts. These thoughts have been created by so many things, both consciously and unconsciously. They come both from your interpretation of the world and from others. Your are stuck in a negative loop of thoughts and emotion. This is what you experience. If your thoughts stopped completely for some time, your whole  experience of life would be something else, I promise you that. This is not something I say just to cheer you up, this is my actual experience of coming out from a depressive state and telling it how it is on the other side. Look it all seems impossible from your end, I get it, I've been there for many years also. What you are experiencing is what you are experiencing right now and it looks very dark and that's all you can experience right now, so what I'm pointing at right now is not and can not be visible to you, it's on a completely different ""frequency"". And by frequency I mean a different emotional state. The only way to actually experience what I'm saying here is to raise your emotional state my dear fellow human. This can actually be done with practice. It will take a lot of work but nothing is more worth it. It's a question of continuing to live in darkness and misery or to switch to another experience of life which is completely different and where the first way of life will seem much more unreal than the new way of living. The process can be very slow and demanding very much attention. Patience and absolute commitment are a MUST on this path of elevating one's state of being. This is no little thing to attempt, this is a fight for a better experience of life and life is extremely short so there is really no time to not feel the best in every moment. Please do not let life go by without really experiencing the other side of it, which is immense joy and beauty. It's real. It is. As your body can produce a state of depression it can produce a state of elation. You can actually take charge of it, little by little, day by day. You can make small progress each day towards a higher state. But think in terms of very small progress over months and years to reach a stable state of wellbeing.   
The practice is to start observing your thoughts, all of them and change them or let them be, one by one. Don't feed the destructive thoughts and just replace them with constructive ones when it can be done. Over time this will change your emotions, but don't give up, it's a game of perseverance. It took years to build up your current mental and emotional structure and it will take years to renovate it. Never never give up because it will work in the end. It's very very crucial to start this process as soon as you start waking up because that is the time when we get a new chance on life. We get a chance to start over and not go in to our past immediately. I see it as a choice of ""putting on the old suit of your personality"" or not. We have to be extremely careful what thought patterns we start when we wake up because those patterns will loop back at us. We set a trend for the day in the morning. The thoughts we go into the first 15-60 min after waking up will be the builders of our minds and emotion. I try to not think at all the first 15 min and then only get into thoughts that will serve me later.  
Also meditation works very well for quieting the mind. Sit crossed legged with your back upright, not to stiff not too loose, and start the process of being comfortable and relaxed with doing absolutely nothing but observing your body, emotions and thoughts. Close your eyes or have them open, try with both methods. Be in the body and let go of every tension coming up. You see a thought come, you watch it, acknowledge it then return to simply being in the body. The emotions will come and go, just be there observing them come and go. This way you will learn to dis-identify with your emotions. They will not be so scary anymore after some time and this practice also makes you process your emotions so they will not be so strong after some practice.  
I really really hope you will get better, and  I truly know it is possible",1

Anxiety,23s9k5,ch090ke,"Absolutely. I took an entire psychology course that was only about the mental health care system in the United States. Deinstitutionalization was a good move for a number of reasons, but there was inadequate planning about what to do after. There's not enough resources for the mentally ill and the resources that do exist are frequently inaccessible. I have serious phone anxiety and even though it's gotten better, I can't call an insurance company myself. I can't even call the doctor myself on bad days. 

The financial side of the issue is, IMO, the worst. There's a good reason why so many mentally ill people are homeless. Unemployment among mentally ill people is drastically higher than the overall population - among schizophrenics it was around 80% last I checked. I wrote a paper about that for a different psych class, actually. I wonder how many people are suffering how my boyfriend is - he doesn't have insurance, but he's ineligible for Medicaid because he's a young unmarried male with no children. Low-income and sliding-scale clinics are difficult to get appointments with and when he did, he and the counselor assigned to him did not click at all, and he had no other option. It's a giant mess.",16
Anxiety,23s9k5,ch0ctb1,"I completely agree with you. After lurking on this sub for months I finally decided to seek help these last few weeks.

She then went on to tell me that it would be a couple months before they will prescribe me medicine.  I have to go see another doctor and if he agrees with her they will prescribe me medicine sometime in thw future.  
  
I tried to stress that my life is falling apart now, and that in a few months time I could be kicked out of college if I don't get a handle on my anxiety and bring my grades up. I need help now. She told me not to worry and that everything would work itself out. I don't get it. You just told me my head is a jumbled mess, but that I shouldn't worry.

Anxiety,23s9k5,ch09naq,"In terms of advocating for yourself, making your own appointments, shit like that, I know it sucks.  I'm well past the age of 18, but I had my mom handle all of those things for me this time around.  (Briefly as background:  I had been off meds for several years and batshit crazy, hospitalized, homeless, etc. then finally went to live with my mom.)  I didn't run into any problems with her doing this for me, even before signing releases.  As soon as I got into the actual offices I signed releases so she was able to talk to the doctors and do other things for me if I was unable.  So...someone should be able to do this for you if you can't.

The 'in crisis' thing is hard, and it sucks.  I was suicidal so I saw a psychiatrist right away, and directly after was hospitalized.  As an alternative, if you feel that you are in a *personal* crisis, that does not fit their narrow confining definition, but still puts you in harms way, you may need to/want to check yourself into a hospital as soon as possible.  They can help you stabilize and get you on a medication regimen.  The average stay is something like 5-7 days.  Also, the hospital can probably set you up with an outside psychiatrist sooner than you would have been able to get on your own.

Took me a couple hours of calling but I finally found someone who could see me in a week vs 30 days or more. I agree it's ridiculously hard to find someone who will take you in a reasonable time.

Anxiety,23s9k5,ch0cz1c,"Agreed!  A few years ago after a week long hospital stay for mental health reasons I was referred to a specialty clinic to address my specific issues, but all I got was a piece of paper stating the referral, and a phone number.  They didn't assist me in making an appointment in any way.  I called once, on my way home from the hospital while I still felt motivated, but the line was busy.  


I didn't call again for 2 years, because I'm terrified of the phone.  When I finally had someone else call on my behalf, I got put on a 2 month waiting list.  By the time they called me (and left a voicemail as I would never have answered!) I was back in a funk and didn't really want to go get treatment anymore.  


It made for an endless cycle for a long time.  I'm finally in, hopefully getting better, and so thankful I actually have good private insurance so I don't have to stress about THAT side of things as well.


Being able to make appointment via email or online scheduling would have reduced my stress about the whole thing so much!

After spending weeks emailing back and forth explaining that I don't have and can't use a phone, they eventually grudgingly said that they might be able to arrange an appointment without an initial phone call, but then communications went dead. They don't respond to emails any more and after so many months I doubt that I was ever actually put on the waiting list. My regular doctor won't offer anything but SSRIs, which exacerbate the digestive problems that are the cause of about 75% of my anxiety. Basically, you can find your own private therapist and pay out of pocket on top of the taxes we already pay for the national health service, or you're on your own.",1
Anxiety,23s9k5,ch100b5,"I have had a very similar experience that, like yours, was full of frustration and anxiety. Once I finally worked up the nerve to call, waited a month and a half for an initial appointment, and got to the office, I had to wait for like, 45 minutes. Well that got me really worked up, and I eventually had a panic attack from all the noisy people in the waiting room and the waiting room tv being on the news. I'M SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM OF A MENTAL HEALTH/THERAPISTS OFFICE CURLED UP, SOBBING IN THE CORNER, HYPERVENTILATING AND SHAKING (thank goodness my husband was there or I would have left and never came back) AND NOBODY DOES A THING. No nurse or anything comes out to ask me if they can help me. After husband asks how long it's going to be (a few times actually) he finally asks if there is somewhere more quiet we can wait. So I get to wait in the ""children's"" waiting room until I can see the Dr.

I got an appointment and at the time it was booked it was a month out, then they pushed it back six weeks, and when I finally got in to see someone, they told me it would be about 4 months before I would even get to see a prescriber even though they deemed me to be ""in crisis"". 

I have phone based anxiety and it took me two years to work up the nerve to make the call to get an appointment in the first place. 

Edit: I should mention that where I am seen ""in crisis"" does not necessarily mean suicidal. They use ""in crisis"" in terms of your diagnosis, which is extremely helpful. So, having severe anxiety, my in crisis state was when my anxiety wouldn't let me get off the couch.

Anxiety,23s9k5,ch0kjq8,"It's not the psychiatrists who require referrals, but the insurance companies.  If your GP doesn't refer you to one, the insurance won't cover it.  Luckily my doctor doesn't require me to come into the office to ask for a referral, so I don't waste a co-pay.  His healthcare network has an ""email my doctor"" function, so I just use that if I need to see a chiropractor, counselor, etc.

I have Humana, and they are notoriously awful about making people jump through hoops to get proper care.  I've been on the same antidepressant for 4 years, and when my insurance changed to Humana at the first of the year, they refused to cover the medication unless I got a form from my psychiatrist saying that it was absolutely necessary...Apparently his having written the script in the first place wasn't proof enough of his belief in its necessity to my well-being.  So ridiculous.  

And even when I was approved, the cost was $345 for a 90-day supply.  ""Sorry the prescription search function says that it'll cost $90 instead of $345.  That's just a tool to give you a general idea; it doesn't actually apply to your specific plan.

I finally went to the doctor at the end of January after a horrible panic attack that rattled me enough to finally seek help. 

After a little over a month on Lexapro I have had no panic attacks and I’m noticing things not bothering me as much. The thoughts that would keep me awake at night and the things I would dwell on have gotten less and less noticeable. My mood as gotten lighter and I don’t get irritable as quickly (like in traffic or at work when I’m stressed). I feel more like I have the strength and ability to solve my problems rather than worry about them and take no action.

I was taking deep breaths every two minutes and I was on the verge of tears.  I'm on 10mg of Lexapro and I feel my anxiety a little bit which is fine because I want know when it is getting worse. I want to feel and not be numb. No issues handling public speaking, stressful situations. I'm more calm and stable than I ever was. 

It might make you a little more anxious or cause diarrhea  at first. It will start kick in around 10 days. It's about 90% effective after a month. I was sleeping well until recently. Now, I'm waking up 4 or five times a night. I go right back to sleep.  Going to stop taking melatonin to see if that fixes it. 
I used to have trouble with premature ejaculation. After taking Lexapro for six years I have anorgasmia. I can get an erection but I have trouble reaching an orgasm. Frustrating and takes some of the joy out of sex. Great if your career path is porn star. I could take Wellbutrin with my Lexapro to counter act this problem but I don't want to take more meds. My blood pressure  medication can also cause erectile disfunction. Why do all these meds affect your penis and make your mouth dry. Ugh!",4

Anxiety,ayh26x,ei0t5o4,"I have been taking lexapro since 2014 and everyone in my family and extended family who have anxiety &depression that take medication for it are on lexapro. It took about a month for me to notice the effects of it. There have been time when I went off of it to see if I was better without it and almost immediately (within a day or 2 of stopping) I noticed I'd slip back down the dark hole that is my anxiety. I always take mine at night because it makes me sleepy. My doctor add didn't tell me that it would do that, so I would reccomend you do that if your doctor didn't say anything. It also made me sweat a lot at first but it went away after 2 months of using it. For me, it helps contain my mood, so a normally  extremely stressful/traumatic ""low time""  where I would have panic attacks and optical migraines became much more manageable and less frequent. I also noticed that the really ""high"" times that would be very happy moments were somewhat muted. It was that muted feeling during the ""high"" times that made me want to stop taking it, but with the good, there is always the bad and I couldn't not manage and even function in my bad times without it. So all in all I feel that it is very helpful and worth it to use to help manage this insidious demon even if it mutes the normally ecstatic times. No medication is a cure all, it's simply meant to help you manage. And if you dont feel like its helping, talk to your doctor, it's okay to try multiple medications until you feel one is working for you. 

Another thing I've done in the past is to ask a close friend or someone I'm around a lot to help me monitor my mood, like if I seem particularly weepy one day or ""down"" or quiet for a few weeks, maybe I need to talk to my doctor about dosing. I did this when I went off my meds and my boyfriend at the time noticed a huge difference.

It was a rough start and it did take a while for the positive effects to show, but be patient.

In my opinion the worst was not being able to sleep, which just made me irritable. 

The first entire week I had split my 10mg dose in half and then went to the full 10mg after all the issues above subsided. My doctor suggested that to ease into my prescribed dose. I’ve had very little side effects since besides I tend to get very sleepy after I take my medicine (I take it at night), occasional night sweats that I’m hoping will go away, and that alcohol hits me much harder and much faster so I really don’t drink much anymore which is ok with me.

Please don't bring the thing that didn't turn out so well over here.  Especially since the best way to deal with many mental illnesses is to manage them effectively, not make them go away.  Because as has already been mentioned, sometimes that is impossible with current medical technology.",4
Anxiety,3niomg,cvoqaqq,"This is dangerous thinking, especially because relapse prevention is super important to any long-term mental health treatment. No one gets cured, they get the right combination of medication and therapy (even temporarily) until they've learned enough about the enemy and what steps need to be taken, that work for them, to win each battle. It is one day at a time for everyone.

You can't tell someone they're cured because everyone is just one big trigger away from a huge panic attack, suicidal ideation, self-medication, isolation, self-harm, etc. Even if you're in a great place, feeling cured as ever, you still have to know what to do in the event you start slipping so that you don't fully relapse back into chronic anxiety/depression.

What you want to happen is that you get in healthy daily habits that keep your negative self talk, whatever symptoms of your mental illness in check. When you get into good mental and physical habits, they stop being a lot of work. You start to do them naturally and each day gets easier as you become motivated by a purpose driven life. That's what being ""cured"" is. ",2
Anxiety,3niomg,cvp3vab,"I'm not claiming that either cancer or mental health problems can be completely cured. I'm simply trying to think of a way to change the overall general public opinion of fear surrounding mental illnesses to increase the likelihood of people getting help and to help reduce the fact that many with mental illnesses become outcasts.

Everyone needs community support. Friends and family rally around those battling cancer (which is great!). When someone has a mental illness, that illness often leads to alienation. People suffering from mental illnesses need as much if not more community support than those suffering other ailments. 

This is not a ""cancer vs. mental illness"" debate. In fact, I think one of the most effective ways of accomplishing many of the goals of mental health advocates would be to partner with large cancer advocacy groups. 

If we could reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and increase education about the illnesses, people would be much more inclined to support those suffering. I am only suggesting a method for reducing this stigma.




",2
Anxiety,3niomg,cvp63n4,"I've recovered from a bunch of mental illness diagnoses and have a YouTube channel where I share videos to help others on a similar journey. I started the channel because I was shocked there wasn't more online about recovery. Most forums or resources you'll find are about having mental illnesses, not getting rid of them. So don't be discouraged if you feel like you got lots of pushback on here. If you took a similar message of recovery to a forum focused on building great mental health, you'd probably see a very different conversation. 

Personally, I find that approaching mental health and fitness like physical health and fitness is an analogy that works a bit better than comparing mental illnesses to something like cancer. I never took any medication and I don't take any medication now, but I did do behavioral therapy, which involves daily exercises. So that's much more similar to going from being in very poor physical shape--which includes all sorts of very real, physical symptoms--to being in great physical shape. Doing that involves navigating a complex mix of genetic, environmental, learned, and personal choice factors, just like recovery from poor mental fitness. 

And just like with physical fitness, if you exercise all of the time and you're really into doing intense cardio workouts and lifting lots of weights and you do an awesome job of meal prepping and tracking your macros and you live and breathe fitness, you're probably not going to be that popular on a forum for people struggling with the symptoms of metabolic syndrome. 

I've definitely benefitted from connecting with others interested in maintaining and improving great mental health. But it's not easy work maintaining a high level of fitness. It's work I love, but it's not for everyone. How we talk about mental health needs to have a range to encompass all approaches. Some people will go from not exercising at all to being able to run marathons but, for many, the changes involved in doing something like that won't be appealing or they'll encounter numerous systemic barriers to making them happen.",2
Anxiety,3niomg,cvoqwux,"Your desire for someone to be 'curable' and 'happy' after a mental illness that no doubt changed them as a person, and will no doubt continue to affect them as long as they live, doesn't mean we should all start treating mental illness as something to be overcome. Chronic or developmental conditions are almost never overcome - only managed. That's as good as it gets, and trying to convince people otherwise is unhealthy. 

The focus would perhaps be better put on trying to treat mental illness more like a 'real' illness, on par with say multiple sclerosis or Parkinsonism, so that people are more empathetic, and less judgmental and dismissive of mentally ill people. Fear of mental illness should be dispelled, as the vast majority don't make people dangerous or 'bad'. 

The focus should also be on the idea that a person isn't 'broken' or 'not themselves' if they are mentally ill. A person should be valued by their own personal qualities, and their struggle with mental illness should not be seen as a defining or devaluing feature.",1

Anxiety,3niomg,cvokkr7,"I think attpting to make people see it as cureable sets it up for greater stigma because management is the best we can hope for in most cases. Going back to my diabetes example, if people around you understand you are trying to manage diabetes, if you lose control (I.e. go into diabetic shock, etc), those around you will be better equipped to react properly to save a life. Similar can and should be done for the range of mental issues a person can face. But attempting to highlight the idea of a cure isn't one of the constructive things here, IMO.",15
Anxiety,3niomg,cvokalt,"I feel like this could almost be more damaging for public opinion. Mental health treatment is often more about managing symptoms than ""curing"" the problems. These are issues that often can't be cured. There's nothing wrong with that. Personally, I think if we start to talk about people being able to ""cure"" mental illnesses, it will just make the people who go from a long period of well managed symptoms to struggling again be seen in a negative light. It's a day to day struggle and I think it's much more comparable to a chronic, incurable illness than cancer.",22
Anxiety,3niomg,cvol5bs,"Even alcoholism can never be cured, even if the alcoholic never drinks anything else in their life.  They are still an addict, even if they aren't drunk.",0
Anxiety,3niomg,cvoli14,No.,0
Anxiety,3niomg,cvooic2,"I think what OP is saying is that they disagree with the idea that mental illness is hopeless. Cancer is a very grave diagnosis, and plenty of people succumb to thinking that it's the end of their life and there's no way they can overcome it. A perspective shift can be exactly what many people need.

I've struggled with depression (among other things but that's another story) since a severe concussion I had a little over 4 years and 2 month ago. I dwelled on it for years focusing on what went wrong instead of what can go right, until I decided to see a therapist that laid things out for me.

All I needed to do was look at it differently and suddenly I felt comfortable in my own skin for the first time in years.

I think OP didn't mean that mental illness should be portrayed as beatable, just that being diagnosed with mental illness shouldn't be portrayed as the end. Just like a cancer diagnosis.",4
Anxiety,3niomg,cvomfow,"Not true, except according to AA. ",4
Anxiety,3niomg,cvox2pe,"That's wonderful for you  (honestly), but not everybody can shake their depression through positive thinking and CBT. For some people, a ""cure"" just isn't in the cards, and if we start pushing the narrative that mental illness is curable, other people will start using that against us. ""Why aren't you better yet?""",6
Anxiety,3niomg,cvoyki6,"I haven't beaten it permanently, but I've beaten it for now. Again, the point has been missed: it's not about ""beating"" it or  ""winning"". 

It's about hope, and that it's possible.",2
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hiet5g7,[deleted],1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hifimwn,"I have minor OCD and had severe intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideations from a very young age. So young that my second memory is of trying to figure out if my window was high enough to kill myself so long as I fell head first and hit the rite spot. My parents essentially rebuked and ignored it so the mental illness took hold and was with me until about 20. My cousin, like a brother to me coming up, killed himself, I was almost ready to do it when he did it, we were half way across the country and didn't talk much so no shared pain, just history. I spent a night with my gun either on the table or to my head from hour to hour and finally wrote a pros and cons list, pros won and I made a promise that I would make life worth living if I committed to being alive. I set out on a journey of meditation, reading and thinking on my own mind and systematically eliminating my intrusive thoughts. It took some time and many changes to my life but I am free. The struggle never ends but I won't allow myself to ever fall back into those patterns again.",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hig0egd,"I can remember running and hiding whenever the doorbell would ring when I was real young. I have had severe generalized anxiety disorder for as far as I can remember. Its exhausting always feeling like you are in fight or flight mode. The only time I have ever felt ""normal"" is when I would self medicate. That turned into a problem for me too. Drinking just so I could feel comfortable in my skin. Thankfully I don't drink anymore but still have anxiety. Im 37 and nothing has ever worked even meds.",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hih5jnz,"I have somerhing similar , i was on drugs so long , i dont reconize how i feel now , i dont know if IT is good OR bad or how should i trully need to feel , thanks to antipsychotics i lost this things",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hietkjl,"Thank you for your reply, I also can't remember a time where I was mentally well. I need to speak to my doctor about going back on medication, so I can feel better again. I've finally found a good therapist, but its nearly 2 decades after my symptoms started, so my mental health has caused a lot of damage in the meantime.",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hifjbtx,"I'm proud of you! May I ask what type of resources you used and how long it took? I know healing doesn't have a time constraint and isn't linear, but some guidance would be really appreciated.",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hig2rof,I'm sorry to hear you have been struggling for such a long time too. Have you been in a position to try therapy?,2
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hiflblm,"The meditation was excruciating for me as silence isn't easy with intrusive thoughts. I did about 2 hours a day for close to a year before I achieved easy silence and by 18 months I had made enormous strides eliminating the cognitive dissonance that was my source of those thoughts. I don't have anything in particular to point to as a resource as I am highly neurologically a typical as I have discovered every time I try meds haha. I had to treat my first successful meditation sessions like a fishing expedition, silence everything, make sure my body was cared for than wait till something broke the silence and attempt to interrogate the source of that thought to its root. Your brain initiates a random thought because a group of neurons has something important, contradictions, latent anxiety, injuries ECT can cause them but once they have gone on long enough they begin to interact making it a bit harder to tease out the original thought.",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hig5tlt,"Sorry to hear about your situation as well. Yeah, I have tried therapy. Didn't work for me. It helps but still have anxiety attacks",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hifm0ts,"Wow, 2 hours a day! Did you work up to 2 hours a day or did you just instantly start doing it?",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hifo1lv,"I was at the point of no salvation and am a highly obsessive person haha, there are definitely better ways to get into it I'm sure, if you're doing even 15 minutes a day you'll see enormous benefits",1
Anxiety,qhsdf9,hifok1n,"Thank you, I am going to try meditation, and see if it helps.",1
Anxiety,117jve6,j9csemq,"I never thought much about it being called ""mental health,"" and calling it that didn't bother me.  Probably because I have to engage mental processes -- change my way of thinking -- in order to get through these things.

But I really think you make a great point.  It reminded me of something Brene Brown said.  We're not thinking machines that feel, we're feeling machines that think.  Emotions were always built into the base brain operating system.  The ability to think logically is an add-on, something that came after.

So, yeah, emotional health makes a lot of sense.  I'm glad you've been able to overcome your emotional health issues!  I have a counselor that I enjoy talking to, and who has helped point things out to me, but ultimately I'm thinking about the angles of events she points out that I didn't think of myself.  I could probably figure it out like you did, but I think it would take me a lot longer to identify everything.  But thank you for sharing your perspective!",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4e7o8,"Yes. You should.

I'm struggling with this same shit but live on my own and gotta work everyday. It's hard AF to keep going. If you can pause any element of life to get better do it. You don't want to burn out on top of it all.",3
Anxiety,n60not,gx4e8fc,"I dont know if you are currently taking medication for your issues, but i think it would be beneficial.  If you are already taking medication you shouldn't be feeling depression to this extreme degree.   Good medicine will not make your depression disappear completely but it should make it far more manageable.   I would discuss this with your doctor and possibly ask if it would benefit you for your medicine to be adjusted or changed so that you could feel more balanced.   Of course, I am not a doctor, but, i do know that there are meds out there that might help and whether or not they are fitting for you is something I cant say.",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4eez3,"Hey, that sounds really rough. I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you'll feel better ASAP. I would personally recommend (what has worked for me in a similar situation) is to sort out your mental health, and then approach whatever you have to do. Especially since the money is not an issue, you should take the summer off, work on yourself and go at it once you're better! Hope you feel better soonest!",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4elyh,"Personally, I would take a break. Your health should come first. And that’s good that you have a strong support system in place. 

You can always get another job and you can always start school back up when you feel well enough to do so. 

I wish you the best. Take care of yourself, mate.",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4hlrd,Do it! It will only help.,1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4vkp8,I've done this several times in my life. It's totally worth it to reset. I'm trying to figure out a way to work or find a job that lets me take the time I need if I'm panicking or whatever. You're aware of what you are dealing with and seeking help and self care. That is awesome. Good job!,1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4emqf,Thank you for responding. It’s definitely been what I’ve been pushing to do in the back of my mind but hearing it from people outside of my has definitely helped. I’m so sorry you’re going through this as well.,1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4ej0u,"Thank you! In 3 years I’ve been on 8 antidepressants that didn’t work well. From March to end of April I was taking Lexapro but it made me feel very robotic so I’m being switched to taking a combination of Wellbutrin and Sertraline, but I haven’t been taken them for even a week yet.",2
Anxiety,n60not,gx4epwy,"Thank you for this reply!! This helps a ton, so thank you so much. I’ve known deep down this is what i should be doing but I’m very indecisive and always fear making the wrong one so it’s nice to have some validation :)",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4evjf,"Thank you so much :) my main concern was that I work a seasonal serving job, and that by not working this year I might get put back to the bottom of the totem pole. But you’re right, take care of yourself first.",2
Anxiety,n60not,gx4gxuy,"Well, I used to take Lexapro and i had anxiety go down but depression go up a little.  For me that was more manageable as i struggle with anxiety as the main overwhelming issue.  But, I started effexor a few months ago and for me it has been one of the easiest drugs to be on.  My wife has been on it for way longer than me and I didnt foresee myself being on it but it does make my life more manageable.   At least, it feels that way.  I hole your new meds work out for you, but always, if there is ever an issue go straight back to the doc and tell them every issue you have with it.   The more you say the better info they have to go on when trying to make your life better.",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4h720,"Thank you!! My doctor was going to prescribe me with Effexor but i shied away from it because people in my family have had bad reactions to it, but you never know it could work for me. I’m on a waitlist to see a psychiatrist so hopefully things can get even better once I speak to them. Thanks again for all your help :)",2
Anxiety,n60not,gx4hogs,"Yeah Effexor is great for me.   If my family reacted to a certain drug i would wonder how it would affect me as well.   People are so unique as to how their pH balance works and how they react to different medicines.   What might be a miracle drug for one person could be like a poison to another.   But, I will say in my house 2/2 people taking Effexor agree it works and is not overwhelming.   I am a lightweight with most drugs and im on a 75 mg.  My wife takes a larger dose not sure how much, but if i miss a dose i dont feel any withdrawal but she tends to worry when she runs out.  Her psych office has messed up and not renewed at certain times and she doesnt feel good going unmedicated.  She also takes something else and idk if that effects her to that degree.",1
Anxiety,n60not,gx4hufq,Okay thanks! If the Sertraline doesn’t work I’ll definitely give it a go because I feel like I’m running out of med options at this point :/,1
Anxiety,10rvevd,j6y8bwz,I don’t really have the best advice to give but I noticed nobody has commented yet and I don’t want you to feel alone. Go for a walk if you can. That really helps me when I have anxiety. I also fear the inevitable of death anytime something happens to me. I will dwell on it and it’s all I think about. And then suddenly one day it goes away and I stop thinking about it. My best advice is to be thankful you woke up this morning. You have another day. Chances are you’re ok and this will all be over soon. I wish you the best of luck just remember at this moment YOURE OK,1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5cjlie,"Ignore the drunk person, people say really dumb things when they’re intoxicated. Unfortunately, parents usually aren’t the best at understanding their children’s individual issues either. 

I only have one friend that I share the extent of my depression/anxiety with, because like you, I just get bad and hurtful advice from everyone else - so I keep it to myself with 99% of people. 

I’m sorry you don’t feel acknowledged.",4
Anxiety,it74b7,g5ckrfy,"I can definitely relate and unfortunately this is all due to lack of education on this particular topic, people choose not to expose themselves to these topics because then they'll have to answer for the emotional abuse they have inflicted onto others or the fact that they have to now deal with the consequences of what they say...so it is easier for them to just ignore it or make light of it.

now of course there are people who genuinely believe that these things are as easy as breathing to just get over because they have been gas-lit  into thinking that's how the brain works, society has a stigma on mental health that is very unhealthy and irresponsible...i think the best we can do really is just continue to tell our stories and advocate for mental health as much as we can...try and educate our loved ones as much as we can, but to also remember it is not our responsibility to teach others on how to treat people with mental illnesses...or to take it seriously...i think separating yourself on an emotional level from them might help you in the long run, unless they eventually show signs of actually wanting to understand...just remember it is not your job to explain your mental illness to them or to make them try and understand...They need to respect your mental health Period regardless of how they feel about it",3
Anxiety,it74b7,g5dfzr8,"I’m on the same boat as you. I literally had a conversation with my mom earlier this evening about how she isn’t able to take my mental health issues seriously, but she still failed to understand. I even had a friend of mine tell me how if I don’t strengthen up and help myself, I’m not going to get anywhere in life. I know exactly how awful it feels, since enduring the illness itself is quite isolating, to top it when we don’t have people around us who understand us, it can be the most debilitating thing in the world. I know you’re not looking for advice but I’d like you to know that there are people out there who feel your pain and who hear you out. Your illness is very real and all the feelings that come along with it are valid. I hope you find the (professional) help you need to get better. Sending you lots of love and strength!!",3
Anxiety,it74b7,g5d03cv,"as far as my family is concerned, there is no such thing as a mental illness..Yep I decided one day that it would  be cool to cut myself up like a ham and ingest gallons of toxins for 20 + years...Good work, mom!",2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5dfwr2,yes.. people who havent experienced it themselves cant ever imagine how hard it is to have mental health struggles.,2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5ge2xv,I have the exact same issue. I've been having really bad anxiety since I had a REALLY bad week last week and its been going on for a week. My parents keep shouting at me and my dad has even said that I'm just doing it to seek attention now...,2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5ckllz,"Thank you for this, it’s rough when you just want to feel validated, but I guess the only person we really need validation from is ourselves.

I’m glad you have someone in your life that you can talk to, I hope you’re doing okay",1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5clhsi,"Yeah you’re so right - mental health awareness is getting so much better but the stigma is still thriving unfortunately. 

It’s just hard, I try to communicate and be open about my experiences, sometimes it’s received well and other times I’m left feeling like this - I wish I didn’t have to advocate or fight to validate my experiences ugh. I just wish people were more understanding and respectful about such sensitive issues.

Thank you for your response, I’m sorry that you can relate to this!",2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5gshzx,"Thank you for your comment, it makes me feel a lot better to know I’m not alone in this, your kind words go a long way. I’m feeling a lot better today! I hope you’re feeling okay, healing and doing well too ❤️",1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5gs20v,"Yeah it’s so interesting how some people are so adamant in their beliefs! I’m sorry that you’re lacking familial understanding, I hope you’re doing well at the moment and are able to find a support system that works for you",1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5gs3hd,"That’s right, not that I ever want anyone to experience it but some empathy would go a long way",2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5gsalz,"I’m sorry to hear you’ve had a bad week, i hope the worst of it is over and you can start to heal from here (if you want to talk about it I’m here!). That sounds like a really upsetting situation, I hope you know that your experiences and feelings are so valid and common, and just because your family doesn’t understand doesn’t mean nobody else will. We all get it and we’re with you",1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5cn6j5,"oh for sure we have definitely come along way from where we used to be on mental health awareness! and i am so proud of the progress we have made! but we still have a lot of work to do. I wish we didn't have to advocate or fight for our experiences just so people can take us seriously...but it starts with interpersonal relationships we start there and make our way outward then i feel like we'd make more progress! until then we have to make sure that we are taking steps in order to nurture our mental health and not allow people to disrupt our peace...

i know that sounds super cliche and waaaay easier said than done, but it holds some weight...I'm sorry that you have to go through this! it's definitely not an easy thing to do alone...Just know that none of this is your fault and your voice matters!! i hope eventually you will no longer have to fight to validate your Experiences!! and if you ever need to vent i'll be glad to help and converse with you here!!",2
Anxiety,it74b7,g5co160,"Sometimes the cliche quotes are the most important! Thank you for your reassurance and support, I really appreciate it. 

I can see on your profile that you’re consistently supporting others online who have been through really difficult experiences - you seem like a really kind and giving person, and I’m sure a lot of people have benefited because of you. Remember to keep taking care of yourself too, and I’m also here to talk if you’d like any support :)",1
Anxiety,it74b7,g5fwvqe,"It is my pleasure!  I find comfort in helping others, so I decided to make this Reddit not too long ago to help people in need of some emotional support! i hope you have a great day or you've had a great day by the time you read this.",2
Anxiety,1012vz8,j2lrd5a,"I think it’s nice to have a partner that doesn’t have anxiety (as long as they’re supportive) because in my case, my bf is a very logical person so a lot of times he helps ground me whenever I feel anxious about something. He is a good problem solver and knows a lot of science facts that can sometimes help me stop spiraling lol. Also sometimes knowing that someone else isn’t worrying about something helps me to stop worrying as well.",1
Anxiety,qvdmie,hkvotsf,"I wish people would educate themselves on mental health issues more. Want to call yourself an advocate? Do some research.

I agree with you, it’s aggravating. Even people with the same issues spread misinformation and bad advice, and I think that’s even more aggravating. They should know better..",14
Anxiety,qvdmie,hkvpj62,"You should seek advice for handling feelings/situations from people who have been through similar things or felt similar ways.

You should seek medical advice from competent, licensed medical professionals whose area of expertise is the area you need medical advice in (e.g., don't go to a foot doctor for head trauma).

That's why I don't even click on posts in this sub that mention medication. I'm not gonna touch it.",8
Anxiety,qvdmie,hkwb8hq,"i was on another subreddit and said i was considering filing for disability and someone just straight up told me ""please don't"" and didn't explain why. Then said all my problems are curable and said i need to practice self-help and get therapy. Then they linked some random ass video in hopes to fix me or something.",5
Anxiety,qvdmie,hkvwpwi,OMFGGG I really hate people like that. Like PLEASE stop if you have never ever had any mind of symptoms.,4
Anxiety,qvdmie,hl04xfy,"totally agree, there's one who guilt tripped me for my mental disorders, telling i had to stop making people worried.",3
Anxiety,4fb31a,d27mgyk,You couldn't have posted this at a better time! I work as a health educator and I'm currently writing a grant proposal in hopes that we will be able to offer a free yoga/meditation program for those who suffer from anxiety and depression. I'm definitely using this article to backup my needs assessment :) ,23
Anxiety,4fb31a,d27otrv,"I recently wrote about this, too. We need to invest in mental health.",8
Anxiety,4fb31a,d280znd,"Some people can put money before health and remain healthy.  Others of us can't, and a ""priority inversion"" occurs, meaning that a counterintuitive situation can occur where putting money as the top-priority *isn't* the strategy that makes the most money, because one's health never improves sufficiently to be profitable.  Sometimes it may be better, first-and-foremost, to make changes in lifestyle, environment, and community that support health, and are life-affirming, and *then* figure out how to make money from there.  (It seems beneficial and important to first stabilize one's situation and find a comfort zone for therapy & healing, before pushing oneself hard to move out of the comfort zone, and strengthen and grow.)  As far as money is concerned, this strategy can allow you to make *some* money in the short-term, rather than *no* money, which is obviously preferable.  More importantly though, in the long-run, it is better for health, and improved life, and improves prospects down the road. 

For me I found that it helped me mentally, emotionally and spiritually to spend time outdoors and be active.  From there I (re)discovered that I enjoyed helping neighbors doing landscaping, trimming trees, road maintenance, and the like.  I also have enjoyed going for long walks, (as long as I was being mindful but not over-thinking things, and reflecting, but not ruminating).  From there I realized that there are ways I could get paid to walk, for example if I walked a neighbor's dog.  

I have tended to get caught up in status issues, and have found it demeaning to label myself a ""dog walker"", because I have worked in more challenging professions.  I'm still working on ways to use CBT or relational-frame therapy to ""reframe"" my attitude towards such a job title and the potential ""stigma"" it can have.  It seems more positive for me to think of the activity as doing a favor for someone, helping someone in need, ""volunteering"" or being ""charitable"" (even though it is technically paid, but where the money might be viewed as a ""bonus, tip or donation""), or engaging in fun activity to play with dogs or go for a run, or being a ""freelancer"", or a ""business owner"".  Maybe this seems silly, but such things seem to influence a person's mental health, through self-esteem, self-image, social image, self-confidence, having a moderate and balanced amount of pride, feeling respectable and respected, rather than feeling shamed or guilted.  

Most people, regardless of their mental state, seem to want to be paid to do what they love, so this is consistent with that, and seems sensible.  

I think business people and entrepreneurs will realize sooner or later that it's very valuable to have a workplace environment and culture that is positive, psychologically safe, respectful, and supportive, not chronically stressful, disrespectful or demeaning.  Such businesses have high turnover, expensive political conflicts or ""HR"" issues, struggle to grow or have ""growing pains"", have their reputations tarnished, or struggle with quality, consistency or competitiveness.  
And it often seems they don't know why, because they don't pay much attention to their people, or don't respect them, or just don't seek to improve their management practices.  

The management is often so bad and intolerable to employees that many people find it more satisfying to start their own small business, even though they take a lot of risk, and work much harder and longer.  But this is another way that larger businesses lose talent, and is another ""hidden cost"" for them.  Some of these small business entrepreneurs now have youtube channels, showing others what they do and how they've done it.  And these are hopeful, inspiring, and educational to watch.  Some of these youtube publishers have even developed small business communities, almost like an informal freelance franchise.  ",8

Years later I can still feel the shame engulf me like a flamethrower. I didn't mean to be a ""problem child,"" I was just scared and panicky all the time because I really thought I was dying.

It’s not that my parents necessarily did anything to cause that need, but I was going through some stuff and it would have helped me create healthy coping methods and move on from some events. As a teenager, I felt really helpless in coping and kind of alone. My parents are unfamiliar with anything mental health related and are unwilling to open themselves up to it. Otherwise they’re good parents, but now I instead feel bad for them because they had rough childhoods and could probably benefit a lot from therapy.",71
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnojmjj,"Everyone said to me that i was just a shy child and it would vanish eventually. I was so scared to go to school that i stated outside, sometime it rained or snowed but i just sat on a bench for 7 hours and walked home. could have died from hypothermia many times. My parents asked how my day at school was, i said fine. they would yell and hit me if i said i didnt went. im 21 now and my anxiety is worse and no one take me serious.",56
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnocygr,"I feel this, I remember trying to replicate the circumstances of one good day, choosing the right clothes, making the right sandwich, hoping that if I did everything exactly right, I wouldn’t have another bad day. It’s crazy to me now that no-one talked to me about anxiety, I only realised when I was 25. Poor parents, I see the same feelings in them and their negative coping strategies, but they have no vocabulary for discussing it and no desire to understand it. My mum’s in denial that her coping strategies affect anyone around her, but so much of my negative behaviours are me imprinting off her. 

Give a hug to yourself and remember that the older generations don’t care about or understand mental health the same way we do. Xxxx",60
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoont2,I’m so sorry. I was the same way. I had chronic stomach aches starting around 8. My mother finally relented and brought me to a doctor who said I was faking it. So of course it just got worse and he prescribed antacids. I was a freaking 8 year old drinking Maalox before elementary school. My mother didn’t seem to think that my mental health needed further exploration. I do feel sad for little me who was so scared about school and life in general.,22
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoffbc,"Yep, my experience was similar and I even had plenty of support from parents as a kid.  Never got actual psych help till I was 19.  Crazy what a simple change of stigma can mean for so many people.",15
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnohg5w,"Same, looking back at my life I wonder how I survived at all. I just want to go back and give child-me a hug and never let go.",29
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoifc2,"I can 100% relate. Growing up in an urban city and being Latina there was no such thing as anxiety, OCD or depression in my culture. I still remember the times that I would try to bring it up / discuss what I was feeling (which was so hard for me to do) and my parents and siblings getting angry and saying I have nothing to be “depressed” about. 

Now that I’m older and I’m finally seeking treatment, I continue to have constant regrets of going through my childhood + most of my early adulthood feeling the way I was feeling and how differently my life would’ve been. However, I need remember to be more kind to not only myself but to my childhood self as well. 

I’m sending you and your childhood self a big virtual hug. You are not alone. ❤️",25
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnosru1,"I had undiagnosed social anxiety when I was younger and I feel the same, I look back on myself and want to cry. I never told anyone how I felt and was so good at hiding it and functioning despite traumatic amounts of stress, no one knew that anything was wrong. So now, as an adult, I'm able to function at these traumatic levels of stress, but I'm totally unaware of when a panic attack is coming on. My therapist has been helping me learn to ""check in with myself"" and how to cope with all that garbage, so it's getting better. But it's wild to know I am not the only one who had anxiety that went undiagnosed the majority of their life and are just now fixing it.",10
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnofgdm,I wish you the best of luck and i can relate. Much of my school social life and grades were ruined because of anxiety and depression. Give yourself now what you wish other had given you during childhood. You can get through it though! I believe in you :),10
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnokz90,"On the advice of my tharapist, I've started looking into the idea of the ""Adult Chair"" and ""Child Chair"" from Michelle Chaflant.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnotm2i,"Same here. In grade school, I had chronic stomach problems that I am now convinced were a result of anxiety. In high school, will all those hormones raging, I was a wreck. I think about all the fights I had with my mom and the confusing repetitive thoughts I dealt with. If I had been diagnosed then..... shit my life could be so different. While I’m happy now, I spent so much time overwhelmed and unhappy.  But I was so scared of the stigma that surrounds mental health problems that I convinced myself I was okay.",9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp07ev,"I feel the same way. I didn’t have panic attacks but anytime I got emotionally overwhelmed I would PASS THE FUCK OUT. Like hit the floor. I don’t even know how many times I passed out as a child (the last time I passed out like this was around 15, I think. I then just started cutting, having anxiety attacks, and binge drinking). Maybe like 20 or so. Perhaps more. That’s just from what I remember. My family didn’t seem to think that was scary enough to warrant seeing a therapist or a doctor? If that happened to my kid that much I would be banging the doctors door down demanding answers. Such is life. I’m still a ball of anxiety at 33. I need therapy lol",8
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnor09j,"I absolutely relate to this, and so many other comments in this thread.

I very much felt like my issues were just so annoying to my parents that I ultimately buried those issues very deeply. I felt like I was just a gigantic pain in the ass to them. I felt they had little patience with me, and that shame was the ultimate tool they used.

I can understand how my neuroses were frustrating, but I felt very alone.

I didn't start to address my issues till I was in my mid-20s and it shows.",9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoysza,"I don’t “blame” my parents for their failings. But I do wonder if they didn’t know or just chose to ignore all the signs of OCD and anxiety in me when I was a child. 

I’ve had a lot of therapy to reconcile those feelings and do my best not to dwell on all the hardships that I had to endure that could have been prevented. 

Your post did make me sad; so many of us have lost so much time to anxiety. It doesn’t help that quarantine has me reverting to some of those bad habits I had as a child (skin picking, trichotillania, anorexia , etc) and I think it’s because I feel helpless. I spent most of my childhood feeling helpless and not in control. So I think that’s why some of these feelings are popping back up again. 

I hope that things continue to get better for you. It is a process and just keep trying to look forward.",9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp1fow,"Same here. Looking back on my childhood, I sometimes wonder how no one connected that a lot of my behavior was based on anxiousness. It feels like it was RIGHT THERE, but hindsight really is 20/20",6
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnov5mc,"Oh man. From what I recall, I was in a constant state of hysteria most of my early years. Every kind of stimulation was upsetting to me. I kind of think I may actually be an undiagnosed autism case.

Undiagnosed autism turns into anxiety and depression in adults. We were not in the right environments for a young autistic brain.  And it caused trauma to our development and view of the world. Which we now associate mostly with unpleasantness.",5
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoxxxf,I can relate to some extent... I was undiagnosed with OCD for more than 5 years until it got really bad and i went to a therapist. For those 5 years many family members used to get really angry due to my strange behaviours and compulsions which made me really sad. The fact that i didn't know what was wrong with me made even more anxious. Then when i was diagnosed not many things changed but i learned to hide most of my worries and compulsions even though they were still there. To this day its very bad and not much has changed but i hope someday things will get better...,4
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoxzsr,"I've had the same thing with depression, and I thought it was normal, I was just exaggerating my emotions too much, or I was defective. I've been taking meds for depression for about a year now, and lemme just say: this whole mental health stuff is a battle that I'm always willing to fight! I've become better this spring and I'm so grateful.",4
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoznr7,"*hugs you tightly* I can relate to this too much. Nobody cared and my parents were too proud to have a ""faulty kid*. They never let me go to a therapist because of their pride. Whenever I asked them, they would get angry and shout at me. I still have horrible anxiety due to their toxic upbringing.",4
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnojups,"Hey, either your parents did the best they knew how to do or they were bad parents who didn’t care.  Only you can decide which it was.  

It’s ok to feel sorry for yourself, but not productive in the long run. There are some online or app resources you can use until the quarantine is over.  After that I hope you will seek professional help. 

I had a lot of the same problems as you did as a child, and my parents didn’t seem to notice.  But they were good parents despite that and I realized that they were just doing what they were taught by their own parents.  When I had my kids I broke that pattern and made sure they got help if they needed it.",6
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnorabb,"I'm 47.  I've got two young adult kids, one of whom suffered from fairly severe anxiety and depression.

Take it easy on your folks.  When our daughter was growing up, we knew she was different than other kids, but you have to understand how very different the world was only 30 years ago with regard to mental health.  30 years ago if someone would have said something like ""I'm going to take a mental health day"" at work, it's literally possible that person might have lost their job.  Mental health was considered private and a taboo subject.  So parents who grew up in that era were not taught about it, and I mean _at_ _all_.  When we decided to take our eldest to therapy when she was in junior high, OUR parents freaked-the-F-out.  So we had no support from our own parents, friends our age certainly wouldn't talk about anything that taboo, and the only thing that got us to get her help was our concern for our daughter, and it was basically ""feeling around in the darkness (of ignorance) on our part.""

So it may seem obvious to you, but it probably was not for them.  Pre-internet, no one other than psychiatrists talked much about mental health, and seeing a mental health provider back then carried a stigma.",7
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoixer,I can relate so much. I guess the silver lining is that I can look out for and help anyone a similar position. Hope you're getting help and support now OP ❤ recognising it is half the battle!,3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnos6fl,"Hey!  Giving you a hug from here!  I just started seeing a therapist right before this all happened.  On the 3rd appointment, she changed it from meeting in person, to meeting over the phone.  I actually found to prefer meeting over the phone.  It was less awkward for me and gave me less anxiety to be able to talk without worrying about misreading her facial expressions as judging me.  She said eventually we can do web meeting type meetings, but I prefer the phone.  My point is to call a provider and see if they can meet with you using an alternative method.

Also I’ll share with you some of the tools she gave me that I’m trying to do every day to help re-train my brain.

1- Write 5 positive things about yourself (this was homework from the therapist)

2- Write down 1 thing you are grateful for every day (therapist didn’t tell me this, but I read about it in a book I’m reading and I’m including it in daily practice (First We Make the Beast Beautiful by Sarah Wilson)

3 -Meditate (also not a recommendation by the therapist, but also in the book by Sarah Wilson). She has recommendations on how to meditate with a busy mind as well.  I haven’t started this yet, but it’s on my to do list.

4 -Read about cognitive distortion and catastrophizing.  Therapist introduced me to these terms and said therapy will help re-wire my brain to not automatically be so concerned with the worst possible scenario being the only outcome to whatever I’m concerned about.  Some methods to try are:
A- Consider other possible outcomes
B- Make the distinction between “significantly unpleasant” and “catastrophe”
C- Increase your perception of your ability to cope

Just ordered a pretty little yellow journal and colorful pens to write my affirmations, inspiring quotes that I read, doodles... I can get hung up on not drawing perfect things lol, so finding instructions online to draw mandalas has been soothing for me and makes me enjoy using the journal more, making it part of my daily habit.  My journal also has pages with a faint grid made of dots, so that helps keep it a soothing activity for me, as it’s easier to keep it neat and tidy and make something pleasant come from all of my anxiety and depression.

Hope this helps you and I’m sorry you’re going through this.  You are not alone and please reach out.  You would make someone’s day by giving them the opportunity to help you.",3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnosu2l,"Same here, I feel bad for baby me.

I went to a therapist two weeks ago for the first time she said I should have gotten help sooner, and it’s gonna be harder for me to work towards getting better because everything I’m anxious about has become my belief system. And it’s been that way for so long.


I am upset with my parents, they saw the signs but did nothing. I struggled a lot, it was really hard.",3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp1ptz,Are you me?!  I dealt with the same thing.  I’m sorry you went through all of that.  Sometimes I feel awful inside knowing we can never get that time back.,3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp2417,"I feel you. I missed a ton of school growing up, and didnt even know that what I was experiencing wasn’t normal until it got so bad, I was having suicidal thoughts and went to the doctor (but told my parents it was for a stomach ache). I was 10 years old or so. Once I got to the doctor’s office, I saw a poster on depression that had all the symptoms. I had all the signs, after that, I knew what was wrong. At least some of it. I had depression. It took nearly 15 years on top of that, to actually seek help. I think back to my childhood and wonder how different it would have been had I gotten help earlier. I am now a teacher, and I wonder how none of mine growing up, suspected something was wrong. Maybe they did. I’m just so happy that I have a good therapist now. I see her twice a month.",3

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoz0fy,"I can relate to this and never really considered it until I was in my thirties. Now that you've come to the conclusion that your childhood experiences were likely closely associated with anxiety it's probably a good idea to move into the current; not necessarily forgetting about it but being in the moment is important. 

As with most of us, being anxious has to do with worrying about something we cant' control like things in the past, future and what may or may not happen. Dwelling on those things only continues the cycle.",2

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp3lc8,"Same here. I was having panic attacks throughout the entirety of elementary school and middle school. Everyone, my friends, my teachers, my PARENTS, thought I was being emotional and over dramatic for attention. Sorry everyone, I was just having a panic attack because of my unknown anxiety. I think the worse part about that for me was that all of my ‘friends’ thought I was just an attention seeker and slowly started to stop being friends with me. That hurt. 

Oddly enough my piano teacher was the only person who noticed my adhd symptoms when I was younger. And guess who has adhd? Me

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp7jcq,"When were you a kid out of interest, was mental health widely spoken about yet at the time? 

I feel you because I had all of this - OCD, extreme social anxiety - but they weren’t words you heard. Nobody talked about mental health - mental health referred to very ill people who needed hospitals and doctors, not kids who were just ‘shy’ or ‘eccentric’. Nobody also talked about preventative things like wellbeing, resilience, emotional intelligence, or mindfulness. School was for learning stuff, not for ‘namby pamby’ stuff like that. 

Honestly I think today’s supposed ‘mental health epidemic’ in teens and schools isn’t unique to this time, it’s just the first time teens have really had the tools and knowledge to recognise what they’re feeling and ask for help.",2

The result, i have a very different viewpoint on my 'happy' childhood memories now...i lived like a prisoner trapped by fear.

Im on the other side now thankfully, but yeah I totally agree lots behavioral issues in kids is probably undiagnosed anxiety issues that with some good counseling would get resolved.",2
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpcib3,"I can absolutely relate to this too.

My siblings used to make fun of me and actually still do to this day. When I was around 8-9 years old I had my first ever major panic attack. 
It was New Year’s Eve and I choked on a piece of pop corn chicken and it really scared me. After that I kept having panic attacks thinking I was choking. It was all because I was scared of that situation and having panic attacks make it hard to breathe and I had no idea what was going on. My siblings think that incident is so funny to this day which makes me really sad. 

My anxiety and depression also made me not ever want to go to school in middle school. I was being severely bullied, so everyday I was terrified to go to school. I would straight up make myself puke to try and get out of going because I was so anxious to be there. On school nights my anxiety would keep me up because I was worried on what people would do or say next to me.

It’s hard not being able to get help during the circumstances we’re under, but I’ve been able to find lots of helpful resources online! This subreddit, for one :) I also really enjoy journaling.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp1e8e,"I can totally relate, I felt like the worst person ever because of OCD and I didn’t know there were more people that passed through the same thing. Once I had a panic attack when I was trying to sleep (the worst time for me were the nights) and I told my mom, she helped me sleep but never took me to a psychologist. When I found out about OCD and how many people went trough that exact same experience I felt amazing and helped myself get through it reminding me all the time that I wasn’t the only one. Clearly I needed professional help and nobody knew about this but my mom (I wouldn’t tell anyone because of shame) so I kept falling again, I had times where the OCD was worst than ever and I couldn’t sleep and that lasted sometimes years. When I turned 18 and fell again, now it was not only OCD but also I felt out of my body like I was watching everything from the outside, that I couldn’t control me anymore and didn’t know who I was. In that time I decided I was going to tell my parents that I wanted to go to a professional because I couldn’t keep going like this, almost a year passed until I finally went, it helped me a lot but the OCD and general anxiety was part of my life by then so it sort of never went away. The best thing one can do in situations like this is visit a professional as soon as possible(the younger the better), having OCD through most part of my life made me accept it as a part of me which is good because I don’t think it can actually go totally away but having it since an early age can produce habits of thinking that will affect the way of dealing with problems and confronting difficult situations.",1

I have depression medicine that I take every day but honestly it doesn't help any. I would like to try anxiety medication but it already took a lot of convincing of my dad for me to get the depression meds. He is very against meds of those kinds.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp7xda,"I think I’m in that situation rn. For example, I used to skip school a lot in 5-7th Grade, just because I was a few minutes late and afraid that people will laugh at me.

Like it’s that fucking easy. There’s a lot more small stuff and then there are also these weird “compulsions” I have. Tapping on things twice so nothing bad happens, not breathing in when I hear certain words like “death” or something. It really sucks. I actually wanted to see a therapist this year (I’m 15 now), but my mom thinks I don’t need it. One time she got mad at me out of nowhere and told me I didn’t “deserve” to see a therapist because I don’t have real problems.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpdbxq,"From pre-k to 5th grade, I would cry and panic and make myself sick so my mom would have to come get me. I had no idea how I looked on the outside. Looking back I remember being in grade school staring at the windows, seeing if the palm trees were swaying hard and how dark the clouds were. (I’ve lived in Florida my entire life) hurricanes were constantly on the news. Not only that, but I grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness so there was constant talk about the flood, and the end of times in the Bible. I would try to preach to other kids because they instilled in us that if we didn’t try to preach to other people they would die and I’d never see them again when I returned to “Eternal Paradise on Earth” after Armageddon. I would constantly worry about the friends I was making and how their family would die and it would be my fault if I didn’t try. I was constantly praying. 
I was traumatized. I would constantly worry about seeing my parents again, every single day while I was at school. One year there was a field trip to the planetarium and I was silently dying inside when all the lights went out to begin the presentation and I watched as the last bit of light shining through from the outside was gone and I would feel trapped and claustrophobic like I would never get out. I had to deal with it all on my own in silence, because I didn’t want people to have to deal with me. Many times I couldn’t avoid crying. Kids made fun of me for crying all the time. I was considered a smart kid, the only thing that saved me was focusing on my work or trying to be the goody goody or the teachers pet. It gave me attention and I wanted to be the best so focusing on my schoolwork is what helped me get through. By the end of the day I would be desperately looking for my siblings at the bus loading zone. If I didn’t see them right away I would panic internally and bite my nails and begin to
cry if I didn’t see them right away, asking adults to check. I remember administrators seeing me with my little sister, who is 2 years younger than me.  I would be in 3rd grade and she’d be in 1st. They would joke about how tough my sister was and how nothing would make her cry in front of me. 

I don’t know if the school saw problems with me or if they assumed I just wanted to be home with my mom. If they did tell my mom, then I believe that she didn’t have the right resources or the money, or just couldn’t see that there was something more than an upset child wanting their mom. My mother came from Mexico, poor as fuck, her siblings took care of her mostly. She doesn’t come from somewhere where mental health would have even been talked about. She didn’t know what anxiety or depression was. I was smart enough that no one had to worry about me because I was considered to be at an advanced level.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpfc9q,"I can really identify with this, I hope you are able to see that it isn't your fault and you made the very best of a truly difficult illness at a time you could not possibly fully understand the magnitude of mental illness and how to survive and cope without support or resources. I've lashed out at my parents as an adult, grilling them on why they didn't listen or help me when I revealed how poorly I felt and the symptoms I was having. I've explained how anxiety has permeated every inch of my existence and has tarnished most of what was a promising adulthood-my full spiral is for another post perhaps. Back then they just said, ""you're just quirky"" ""everyone gets nervous"", maybe you're just being shy because there's a girl you want to impress. I elaborated the best way a 12 year old not knowing what the hell was wrong could.   

I'm grew up in a small town. Mental health was a topic for the loony bin, no such thing as a child psychologist or even social worker ; even if there were, my parents wouldn't have taken me. I know my teachers at my small catholic school could tell I was in pain by the way they would look at me while I struggled to read (I graduated with nearly a 4.0 GPA, but it nearly killed me to just show up), but none so much as offered to help. Interestingly enough, another student in my class was apparently having anxiety related problems and was taken out of class for the better part of 7th and 8th grade and given therapy (possibly meds) and assistance with coping because his parents heard him and tried to put the fire out. Naturally, every kid in the class lambasted him and gave him a scarlet letter. So I decided, I can't get help, this is my new and awful normal. 

I've been to trauma, talk and CBT therapy, over 15 meds (including antipsychotics....awful), and hypnosis, and acupuncture....nothing has ever healed the scars from my childhood. But don't ever give up, there are people who understand you and I've learned to accept what is and what could have been. I want to help people understand this illness.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpl8uw,Same here ! I’m in therapy but it’s hard and definitely struggling w all the built up trauma and negative memories that all make sense now.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpleft,"I relate to this shit so much. I would purposefully make myself cry to get sent to the nurse because I had a “headache”. This usually led to me being sent home, it was better than being trapped at school.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpqlkx,"Yeah, I had a lot of issues as a kid that went unrecognized and eventually turned into the hell that was ages 15-19 for me. It’s so important for parents to pay attention to their kids and realize when something’s off. I do blame it on them because looking back, it was so obvious and they didn’t push me enough. As much as I’d like to I can’t get those days back and it made me extremely depressed for a while, but eventually I realized that you have the choice to move on. I hate, hate hate the quarantine, I want to go out and do things so bad, but there’s nothing we can do about that right now so it’s best to focus on what you can do for yourself.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnprgzr,"I used to lay in the bathroom and pretend to be sick, rather than go to school. I hid from family gatherings (even if just 1 relative or something came over), I avoided my own family (in my case though, my dad was a psychopath on top of me having anxiety, he may even be the root cause of it but I'm not sure). But yeah I remember feeling physically sick and skipping school all the time. It was miserable. And yeah I'm diagnosed now but doesn't make it any better. I feel your pain. As a child no one understood or seemed to care, they thought I was lazy and weird, looking back it should've been quite obvious if my parents or any adult in my life was actually a real adult, but looking back they were still messed up children themselves, focused on themselves, greedy, self absorbed and broken, addicts and abusers.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnptf96,"Same here. And now I'm working on unlearning all the toxic coping skills that my parents used to deal with their issues that I of course learned from them. Its hard, but I'm slowly making progress.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnptv6j,"Many of us can relate. You went through this in childhood. I went through this in my youth. The variety of ways in which panic, anxiety and OCD can manifest neurologically, physiologically and in thought is astounding. Many of my weird pains, aches, symptoms all boiled down to my animal mind trying to repeatedly expose my system to a pain and see if it is actually life-threatening. If I thought something should not be done or thought, my OCD-anxious mind would latch on to those very fears and keep repeating them till I found a solution. And I'm decently intelligent and imaginative (which is also common with the disorder - stupid people have it much easier with panic or anxiety) so that complicates everything individually. 

My first phase was 2 years. And my second phase after being high functioning for 15+ years has been almost 2 years now. But this time I read books on anxiety and OCD and for the first time understood what I had been suffering for 20 years. It has literally been a released-from-prison experience.

I often think nowadays - people facing coronavirus anxiety are facing these new feelings of fear and uncertainty for the first time, I could lecture them on how to cope and how bad it could get and how lucky they are that the next news item does not send them into a huddle.

And in that sense, I also think those of us who have managed to control live with or overcome our variant of fear disorder, can handle coronavirus anxiety much easier compared to the rest of them who are feeling these things for the first time.

This is a standard signature, like in web forums. Everything needed (apart from medication) to reduce anxiety by 80-90% is in here (it's quite a bit and it takes time, but it is worth it):

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnq144n,"Same, I've struggled with pretty bad ocd my entire life",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnq868d,"I’ve never thought about that but when I saw this post I re-evaluated my life for a minute. I had many moments I remember that would make me fall under the category of anxiety/ocd. I used to be called crazy and dramatic growing up but it has affected me and I am now 20. I have taken lexapro, Xanax, and klonopin and have seen three therapists",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqac2w,"I understand. I think I developed anxiety after I had an experience in foster care. Once I was back with my family, everyone always talked about how “shy” or “bashful” I had become. Once I hit middle school, it reached it’s peak. I couldn’t order my own food at restaurants without crying. My parents thought I was just dramatic and that it was just hormones. 

When I was a sophomore in college, I finally worked up the courage to go talk to the school nurse & counselor about it. I got on medication and I don’t lay awake every night in panic anymore. I feel like an actual human being for once. 

I’m so frustrated that I was so obviously traumatized and anxious and no one in my family noticed or tried to make me better. Instead they blamed me for not “going outside more”. I wasted ALL of my teen years worrying about every little thing.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqf90b,"I'm 21 and my family are joking that i should see psychiatrist because am usually distracted, dispersed and forgetting a lot, like i should be embarrassed. they don't know what's behind that .

note that mental health awareness here is awful specially for there generation. they just don't know.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqga47,Same here. Particularly social anxiety. Just seen as a quiet shy child and I fell through the cracks/was invisible all through school. I don’t feel like I’ve developed any social skills. I still feel like an awkward teenager at 26.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqhsvz,I'm so sorry. I just posted on this sub a similar thing I'm going through. I hope you can find the help you deserved in adulthood.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqlwr0,"Same. I’ve had horrible anxiety and depression pretty much my entire life, but my parents never acknowledged it other than calling me dramatic when I was upset/panicky. I specifically remember telling my mom that I thought I had anxiety at like 14, and she sent me to my room for being dramatic. It took years for me to be able o take my own emotions seriously because I had gotten so used to every feeling being written off as drama or attention seeking.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqm0xm,"I wasn't really fully aware to the extent of my issues with anxiety & OCD until I was mid to late 20's. I don't think I was honest enough with myself, I thought I could just avoid situations that would make me uncomfortable and with age and experience, things would get better. Now I'm in my early 30's and I am more reclusive and anti-social as ever. I wish I had got onto it earlier with medication but there's no good wishing your life away, have to work with the time and knowledge that you've got.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqniv1,"This is all hitting me right now too, and its unfortunately forced me to realize how shitty my parents are :/",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqp8vs,"Same here. It's sad, really. I could remember as early as kindergarten I was afraid of everything and I was doing these ritualized behaviors at a young age (OCD hand washing 16x a day, not touching doorknobs, and etc) Its got in the way of a lot of things in life.

But now that I'm older (21F) I just try to tell myself that it's okay and it will get better. Some days are better than others, it usually depends. I know it is different for everyone but that's my way of trying to cope.

Wish you the best :)",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqqcdl,I relate to this SO MUCH. I was sick and suffering. When I look back on my childhood I can’t help but feel so sad for myself and how much I was hurting and all the things I missed out on because of anxiety.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqr63o,"I relate to this so much. I grew up in the rural Bible Belt in an area of the country notorious for poor health care. As a kid I was having nightly panic attacks that resulted in me hyperventilating and feeling like I was dying and needed to go to the ER. This happened every night for months and months. It was pure hell. My mom would usually just yell at me or tell me it was all in my head. 


I finally got her to take me to a doctor. We didn’t have health insurance. The doctor asked me what I was doing every time I had a panic attack. I told him that I liked to read and that’s usually what I was doing when I was having a panic attack. Then he asked me what I was reading and I told him my favorite thing to read was Harry Potter. So the doctor basically told my mom that Harry Potter was evil and giving me panic attacks and to stop letting me read HP. My panic attacks didn’t go away and it took me about 20 years to finally go to the doctor and get a diagnosis. And it turns out what was most likely giving me anxiety and panic attacks was being at home because it was so abusive and neglectful.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqsuqr,I’ve been thinking the same recently after 28 years of feeling unheard and broken finally working out I have undiagnosed adhd and possibly a few others instead of just anxiety I was always told. Many people should have noticed my strange behaviours but everyone ignored me so I was left thinking It was in my head. Silver lining is at least I’ve got the help now and can have the weight off my shoulders at last knowing my problems weren’t my fault and I did try my best,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqtw4v,"I was a happy, very talkative kid in kindergarten and first grade, then switched schools for second grade. I'd have the worst tummy aches before school. To the point my parents did take me to the doctor. They had me try lactaid thinking maybe I was lactose intolerant (which is gross, by the way). Then I had to keep a poop log (heh) where I was supposed to note every bowel movement, and whether they were turds or logs. I don't think they ever found anything causing it, and eventually my parents gave up.

Only twenty years later did I realize - holy shit, duh. That was (still have it, presents differently now) anxiety.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqul4f,"I was you too.  So many issues that I think back on because of anxiety.  I have this super vivid memory of getting a C in social studies in 5th grade and not understanding why but going home sick because of it.  My parents
Didn’t understand and would just let me stay home when I didn’t “feel good”.

That trend continued through college but was often covered up by the anxiety pushing me to be an over achiever.  So of course anxiety comes with good grades and a great college and being a competitive figure skater with body issues to boot.  Thankfully in my mid 20s I finally got diagnosed and got some help.  Thank. Freakin. God.

10 years later I’m still in meds and in therapy and working through things.  I hate to say it’s a constant battle and it’s a chronic disease that needs constant management.  But when your good about your treatment (meds, good foods, exercise, meditation) you can conquer the whole world.  It’s just a matter of finding a combo of treatments that work for you!",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqva7q,same.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqxohh,"Yea that's a big revelation I have had about myself in recent months after having more than enough time to myself. I spent so much time trying to normalize having bipolar family that it also made me overlook negative habits and coping mechanisms. That said, keep pushing through and make yourself happy by any means necessary! Having a purpose, working towards anything, and taking it a day at a time is really how anxiety improves.",1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnr087j,I can relate 100%.  What everyone saw as bad behavior were just cries for attention...,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnrmoyw,I haven’t told anyone I have anxiety and OCD. How do I go around to it.,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnohhn9,"Life bro, everybody is anxious.",-9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnq9r7i,tysm lol i realized recently that all the things i experiences as a kid were not normal and i shouldn’t be thinkin like that. i really did think i was dying,10
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnogct4,"I'm in the 'I didn't get help until age 35 club' too. So, Hi :)",38
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqyk7o,Exactly the same shoes. How is everyone doing? I thought i am the only one. It is because my psychiatrist thinks I lie.,3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpwqvx,"I did ask for therapy in high school and when my mom would pick me up from sessions, she would ask me if I was cured yet, LOL.  I couldn't really tell my mom that she was a big part of my problems (she definitely wanted a different type of daughter - like outgoing, fun type - the kind who would go shopping with her and like the same things she does.  The pivotal point was when she asked me, ""why can't you be like other kids?"" ) I can laugh now but I was pretty fucked up all through middle and high school, severely depressed and suicidal and definitely dysfunctional.  Took a long time in to adulthood and one fantastic therapist to help me gain perspective (it is really hit or miss with therapists, you really need to find one you connect with to gain success, I think.  I had a lot of shitty ones over the years).  It wasn't until I ""accepted"" this part of who I am before I was able to be unburdoned (as counter intuitive as it sounds).  After weaning off meds, and once I understood that getting deeply depressed sometimes is okay, being a loner sometimes is okay, as long as I stay conditioned to doing ""life"" habits (getting up, going to work, cleaning, eating healthy, exercising and keeping a strong daily routine) that I can be me and be okay with that.  Cliche as it sounds, if I can accept me, others can, too, and if someone doesn't like me, it's not the end of the world",12
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpoiui,"I feel the same way. My parents are the greatest I could ask for but I wish they would've realized that me not having a conversation with anyone for weeks on end wasn't just me being ""in a mood."" I'm 23 now and JUST starting to feel like I can deal with my emotions. I definitely still have problems but I have at least identified what is causing them.",9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnq9w3f,mine sent me to therapy as a kid for my SUPER INTENSE OCD and it got better but now as a teen it’s just general anxiety. i haven’t thought about going into therapy until recently and then COVID happened,3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoq4u3,This breaks my heart. Are you able to see a counselor?,9
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnofga6,"My dad was absolutely shocked when I told him at age 35 I had just been diagnosed with anxiety. “But nobody in our family has mental problems.” Funny, he’s wrong as it’s not just me, he just had NO clue.",29
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpsbw7,Omg the amount of malox I drank! The chronic stomach aches and headaches and teeth grinding. Ugh,6
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnq56yj,"I had the same “stomach ache” problem. I had tons of slips where I’d go down to the school nurse. She was a very mean woman (when I got my first period AT SCHOOL she belittled me in front of a bunch of other students and said I should’ve been prepared) just said that I was hungry and would give me crackers. Or would straight up say to my face I was faking it. My mom would sometimes pick me up, but nothing every came out of it. It’s not that she didn’t care, but just didn’t know. 

It wasn’t until I was 27 and had a mental breakdown at work and went to my dr that I was told I was depressive and have GAD.",5
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqa3if,that’s insane because lately i’ve been having chronic stomach pain too. i’ve thought about it being anxiety related but wrote it off and now it’s happening again.,3
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqa0f1,me too :( hope ur doing better now <3,4
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoj5br,"I relate to this too, except I'm Asian. Recently my family and I were watching home videos and in one of them I was visibly very sad/out of it on a family vacation, and my brother angrily said to me, ""Yeah you really didn't smile until you were like 18,"". At the time I remember thinking that no one could see how I was suffering because no one said anything to me, or tried to help. I'm 25 now, and it hurts knowing that they could see how sad I was back then but just chalked it up to me being a brat.",19
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqaazh,"you too <3 thank you 
i appreciate how i have it kind of ok as my mom at least accepts that anxiety is a thing that i struggle with. my dad comes from a country that doesn’t really “do” mental health so he doesn’t get it and my home environment isn’t amazing to try to cope but i appreciate u🥺",1

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqal1j,thank you :) as a child i just would get panic attacks and “have to do” insane rituals that i now realize were OCD and anxiety signs. i would convince myself i was pregnant or whatever. like. that’s not normal for an kid,1
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqawrh,i hope get better and thanks for sharing <3 i got angry a lot as a kid and it freaked my parents out bc my behavior was not normal. it got to the point that i bit someone where they decided i needed help,2

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnpsot6,"I am so sorry for your struggle. It IS hard! I hope you are on a better path & seeing some light along the way.

FWIW, as a parent, it would be really hard to trust a therapist with your kid, especially if they are very young. And  I couldn’t imagine trying to find the best therapist-taking your kid to multiple people...that sends a message too. 
It’s a very tough spot. I want to weep for my own kids, that I might not have always done what I should’ve. But I surely can help them now so continue to try.",3

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoqc73,Absolutely,2
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnoodff,"I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm also 35 and I can say with certainty there was still a lot of stigma surrounding mental illness when we were younger.

I just got diagnosed at 34. I had been in and out of the system without a proper diagnosis for over a decade until finally getting the correct diagnosis and medication to help me. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars (mental healthcare isn't free here, but there are A LOT of more cost effective options now than there were 10+ years ago).

Poor understanding of the importance of mental health, perhaps incompetent health care providers, a poor support system, financial reasons,  and a lifetime of being indoctrinated into a false belief system, are just some of the barriers standing in the way of someone being able to get help until later. Anxiety has already stolen 35 years. We should commend these people for taking their lives back, instead of putting them down for not doing it sooner.",33
Anxiety,g2yamz,fnp3v4p,"Also people don't often know they they are suffering. They don't know they have anxiety.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqu547,"Based on some of your other comments, it seems like you've found some things that really help your anxiety.  Running seems to really work for you, and that's fantastic!  But it seems like you don't have a whole lot of sympathy for anyone who doesn't have your level of motivation, discipline, or emotional resources.  

Please understand that what works for you does not work for other people.  Please practice compassion when someone expresses a struggle rather than advising them how they should have fixed it or how something is their own fault -- that advice is rarely constructive and is often shaming, and I don't think shaming is something we should be doing in this subreddit.",2

I didn't realize how much of my personality and how many of my ""normal"" thought patterns were stemming from anxiety until a doctor finally took the time to talk to me about anxiety.

What that means is, parents are human. Parents are trying their best with what they've got but ultimately and inevitably they will fail their child. In some way. It's unavoidable. it's the way things work. Everyone has some story about how their parents failed them in one way or another. It's a right of passage. Yes.

Anxiety,g2yamz,fnqvshb,"> Please *practice compassion* when someone expresses a struggle *rather than advising them how they should have fixed it or how something is their own fault*

That's the part I'm trying to communicate here -- I can understand that you want to encourage people to not victimize themselves, but by using phrases like ""you should"" you're introducing fault and blame (which induces anxiety!).  I think other comments are also trying to point out is that a lack of awareness and understanding that your experience isn't normal means you don't KNOW you need -- or can get -- your mind to work in any other way. So until you discover that your suffering isn't something that everyone else is just ""better at dealing with,"" you may just think ""this is the way life is"" and not get the support you need.

My recent mental health issues got in the way of my relationship too, on both parts, and I think it was for the best in the end, but it has taken a toll on me. I wonder if I will ever be able to handle a future relationship until I fully get better. My symptoms are different no pain but I have stomach issues, I have completely lost my appetite, lost so much weight, can never eat, constant heartburn. I feel it could be due to anxiety, but I am still trying to figure it out. Your suggestions really help. I have been smoking weed daily for 3 years, but it no longer helps, maybe just CBD would.

As corny as it sounds, I found spending more time in nature to help with my anxiety. I overeat because I’m anxious and then I’m anxious because I’m fat (viscous cycle). I started to take up hiking. At first it was a nice flat trail that would be half a mile and over the course of 8 months my hikes became longer. My weight shed as did my anxiety.

I know there were people with adhd and neurodivergent exist but I didn’t know where to find because I’m only look what was on the for you page. But after I struggled with depression and toxic friends who just act naive about my adhd  (with undiagnosed autism )and neurodivergent symptoms and and tell me to act like everyone else. I have trauma of social interaction, I lack communication skills because ive never done that since I was 13 , I don’t get physical panick attacks but rather my mind would blank out and my mind would unable to think , even if I want to talk my mind can’t think of anything words or sentences it’s just blank. My mum ask me if I want to go back to therapy last year 2023 ( I stop going in 2021) , I said no I don’t want . Well yes at mid 2023 I felt fine , but it was end of 2023 that everything fell apart. And I mean I feel I needed someone to talk to . I do have online friends but it’s as far as you can tell they’re just not your therapist, some friends you can talk to about your problems, some friends just want to be friends. And my ex friends me in group chat why am I always depressed and that they also have body aches and should go find a job already and stop making excuses. 

They said if you wanted empathy , sorry we are not that kind of friends, we telling you the reality. 

Ummm hello, I’m going through deep depression , the lowest point of my life at the end of 2023, that I had to cut off a group of friends and start 2024 with hives , I was Very stress in January through March still thinking about them and crying losing 10 years of friendship, I just needed someone to tell me that “ it’s not true and I can do it “ no need for negative feedbacks cause I was in need of emotional support. which I didn’t expect, I was hoping to rest for January to March and to find a job in April but after the hives ended, I keep have itchy episodes and itch subsides that never go away on my entire body and I found out in September it’s stress itch . The itch feels like hair crawling, but recently gotten worse, it’s burning itch now and 2 days ago had to go to the clinic and got referred to the skin centre. I really hope I get the help I needed , been crying everyday since May, I can’t take this. 

It all began in September 2023 when I had pain on my shoulder it started when I took expired meds now that remembered, i need to tell my mother.",1
Anxiety,hk99q9,fwtlubi,"Hey, orange. I know how you feel in regard to the relationship but your loss of appetite and weight also seems to me like a symptom of depression on top of anxiety. I haven't experienced that often but I just want you to know that speaking to someone experienced can help. I don't know what your current situation is but is it possible for you to go to therapy? 

Also, take this as my personal opinion, but I think smoking weed can heighten anxiety if done extensively. I've smoked a few times at parties and with friends and have gotten overly anxious a couple of those times. I've since avoided it and only smoke on specific occasions now. I know people who smoke for their anxiety and it works for them, but I'd suggest trying out just CBD with low THC content and see how that goes.

They can be sympathetic but they'll never really ""get"" where you're coming from, and sometimes it can feel like they don't care or don't believe you.

I know when I first started having anxiety problems, I'd fly into panic attacks at random and rush out to the emergency room, totally convinced I was dying. After a while, it felt like my friends & family (at least the ones that haven't had anxiety issues) didn't believe me no matter what. Essentially everyone viewed me as a hypochondriac for years, even when there *was* something actually wrong with me, because they thought every time I felt sick/in pain/whatever, it was just my anxiety acting up.

TL;DR, I know what you mean and all of us here on r/anxiety are willing to lend an ear :)",23

Anxiety,1bhl2h,c96sjhs,"My family doesn't really believe anything I say. This isn't to say that they don't hear my words and don't think that I'm telling the truth, but they downplay everything that I believe or feel or know about myself in favor of their own view. They don't want me to feel the way that I feel, and they think they wouldn't if they were in my shoes, so I'm almost completely dismissed outright by them.

My anxiety tends to manifest itself in withdrawal. I don't get overly jittery or visibly upset so much as I shut down. I stop wanting to be around people, don't like being asked questions, etc:. I don't live with my folks anymore, or even in the same city, but whenever I'm home the feelings of helplessness and subordination come back with a vengeance, and they just keep pushing me when I don't want to deal with them as though they can bring me out of my shell instead of stuffing me even deeper into it.

I used to take their perspective as the right perspective, because my thinking was flawed. But that wasn't the way to go. Only you really know what's going on in your head, and only you know the way that you feel. The biggest obstacle for me was trusting myself, even when no one else would. Your worth is self-evident, no one can take it away from you.

I'm not entirely sure how I began to understand and believe that. I wish I could tell you directly. We both know that words are empty sometimes, there are lots of things people tell us that we wish we could believe, but just can't.

I, of course, didn't have an answer.  Because there isn't a real, rational answer to that question.  Because it doesn't matter.

Then she asked ""you have a shrink, why don't you tell him about all of this instead of your family and friends?""

Again, I didn't have an answer.  Then I started using my shrink because it's what I pay him for, and even added a therapist.

It's not that nobody wanted to help.  It's that nobody knew what to say or do.",5
Anxiety,1bhl2h,c96ud2y,"I can totally empathise with this. I had depression when I was 17, and my mother replied with ""You don't have depression, you're just a little bit down"".

Lots of kids like to say they are 'depressed' when they're young. It was pretty demotivating though.

Then after the depression I've suffered from really bad social anxiety as a sort of left-over effect. I told my dad recently that I was looking to see a therapist about it, he replied with ""Have you ever considered that you might just be lazy?"". Even after he found out I had started seeing a therapist he said he didnt think anything was wrong with me.

When I was about 13, 14, I had my mom help me straighten my hair even though I didn't need help, I just wanted to tell her I had depression and I wanted help. She said ""Oh honey, I think we're all a little bit depressed"". I started sleeping all the time and didn't do anything anymore and was just called lazy. Since I was young, I believed her.

I tried to kill myself later and was in the hospital, and everyone acted like nothing ever happened. 

People always tell me I just need to find a hobby I really like. Well... I used to like running, and I used to draw all the time, every day. I used to find joy in a lot of things. Now I don't.

When I sleep 14 hours a day, and I feel bad when I'm awake, people (my boyfriend especially) tells me I just sleep too much and I need to get up and get used to it and I'll feel better.

I also sleep really crappy. I'm a light sleeper and everything wakes me up. My boyfriend snores and won't consider fixing it somehow. I lay awake for about two hours when I even get into bed. Sometimes I'll wake up after a normal amount and feel totally refreshed but just can't bring myself to get out of bed.

People just give me their normal fixes for things that I have problems with. If I were normal, it'd work, but I'm depressed, so it doesn't. 

I just don't say anything anymore. I tell people I'm lazy, and just a grumpy person, and I don't like talking. Which is not true, hardly at all, it's just how my depression appears. ",2

After I finally came clean about how suicidal I've been for the past few years, she claimed she had known all along how bad I was, even though I had thought I was hiding it. It hurt so badly, because when I was first suicidal I told her and she couldn't have cared less, and never ever brought it up again or checked up on me.

I actually have both a Psychologist (been seeing her for 2 years) and a Psychiatrist (4 months).

At this point I don't expect my family to be able to help me (that's why I'm in therapy). At the bare minimum all I want is just their acknowledgement of what I've said and I don't even get that. On FB I post pictures, articles, and whatever information I feel is relevant for them regarding mental health, depression, anxiety, and information for family members who have friends or relations suffering and what they can do to help. And I get nothing. Yet one of my sisters changes her profile pic you may as well shut down FB with the interest.

It's something that I've only recently come to realise and talk about in therapy - my stupid need to have my family's support, understanding, acknowledgement and love. I have a large family and I've come to believe that they're all narcissists to some degree. Rationally I know that they will never change and can never give me want I keep desperately trying and wanting to get from them but it feels like my emotional side won't let the idea/possibility go. I equate it to constantly hitting my head against a brick wall, expecting to be able to break through it, and being disappointed that it's not working, and surprised that it's hurting me. 

I guess because I don't/can't trust or love myself (for whatever reason), I automatically look for it from the people I instinctually expect it from.",1

They don't know how bad it's gotten, and they don't want to be enablers or whatever.

Ultimately, it's going to have to be you that works hard and gets better. Your family can't do it for you, and even your shrinks can only give you the tools.  I know it would be a lot better if you had your family's support, but you can and will do this without it.

One thing I found is that when I stopped looking for support and got down to the business of getting better, I made more progress. It sounds isolating, and it is. It can be depressing. But I talk to my shrinks about it and they use those feelings as opportunities to make me more self sufficient.

I'm not defending your family. I don't defend my own family. I just try to keep focused and try to be the best me I can be. It's really the best I can do. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But I have to keep trying, no matter who is in my corner.",2

Anxiety,wgzg12,ij2pub3,"I think there are a few things to unpack here!

Anxiety is often driven by avoidance so it's perfectly normal to feel nervous about going back after taking a break. A bit like going back to school after the summer holidays or getting back on your bike after you fell off.

Taking some time off is still a great chance to ""reset"", but it's also important to address the root cause of what made you feel this way and look at what you can change to stop it from happening again.

I'd really recommend looking up workplace adjustments for mental health issues and thinking about what your work could do to support you, and then have an honest conversation with your manager about how you're feeling and what you can both do so you're better supported going forward.

For example you could ask about whether you could do a phased return to work where you only work part time to start with. You could agree to have more regular catch-ups so you can get more support.

You said you experienced a really difficult situation at work - it might be helpful to discuss this with your manager too.

Finally you really don't need to tell everyone you're okay when you're not - sure you might want to keep doing that with people you don't really know, but being honest with your manager and other people you work closely with might help you to feel less alone & give them a chance to support you.",3

It can be a blessing and a curse having technology at our fingertips.

Anxiety,u336ln,igh756g,"Hey there,

I guess I can give a bit of a trigger warning before I write my answer, just in case. I did receive a diagnosis but only read on if you're okay with this.

A lot has happened since I wrote that post. It didn't really go away for me initially. I had some other symptoms come on and ultimately convinced my GP to order me a few MRIs. I'm glad I did. It turns out I do have a congenital condition that typically manifests adults in their late 20s to early 30s. It's not generally fatal and you can live a normal life with it, but it's moreso quality of life that it effects. There is a corrective surgery that can help, but it has about a 66% success rate of improving your symptoms. But the condition pertains the movement of cerebral spinal fluid and can effect a wide range of systems in your body. The condition is called Chiari Malformation type 1. I'd say I'm better today, but each day is completely different, a bit like a rollercoaster.

I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have with symptoms, severity, etc. if it would help you.

Take care!",2

1. You are only a senior in high school. You dont need to feel like you need to have life or yourself figured out. College, travel, new friends, good experiences and the bad, will help shape you. This isnt a one time thing. It will happen in your 20s, and 30s, and 40s....etc. As you get older you will start to continue to change as a person. 
2. Try to remember you are human. Humans make mistakes, have good days and bad days, failures and successes. Additionally you will have good days/months/years and you will have bad ones. The point is that you can realize everyone else in the world goes through these same feelings and so you are not alone.

Anxiety,pmderl,hchhk9r,"I understand what you are going thru, as I am also dealing with it myself. I have been home since March 2020 working remotely. And like you during the height of the pandemic and even now, my anxiety levels to go do normal tasks like grocery shop made it really difficult for me to leave the house. And when I did I would get overcome by anxiety. My routine pre pandemic we’re very long work hours during the week and family/friends events or dinners on the weekend. During the pandemic if not for my dog I don’t think my anxiety would have even let me go outside for fresh air. My take is that it took over a year to kind of get to this peak level of not caring to go out anymore or even do much while I am home and it’s going to take just as long to revert back to how we functioned in life before. Which sucks and sounds so daunting. I basically force myself to go out some days and for the most part I do feel better once I’ve spent time with friends or family even if it’s just a couple of days a week. And believe me some days it’s a true struggle to force myself to get up and get going. I think the best thing to do is set small goals for yourself every day. Mine would be things that pre pandemic I wouldn’t think twice about like clean the house, Visit my parents to have dinner, go to the grocery store, take the dog to the park, make plan to go see friends. Some weeks I do better than others, but I think it’s important you know that it’s a slow build to perhaps getting back to how you felt before all this. Therapy or a psychologist would probably help immensely as you said was suggested to you. I myself have an appt next week because as much as I have avoided it and have a hard time asking for help, sometimes it’s truly needed. Give yourself time and also a break, this has been a life changing event. No one is going to come out of this exactly the same as they were before but setting yourself up to do even small things a day, like make the bed, cook dinner, exercise can help a lot in re establishing the routine and safety you felt before.",2

I had up and downs for years, but managed to become pretty successful. Then It all came crashing down and I lost everything. I’m just a shell at this point. Almost 40 and have nothing left and no desire to try anymore.

It bothered me that my SSRIs took like 6 weeks to kick in and boy was that a long 6 weeks after a few weeks locked up.  Sounds like you have a support network, it's OK to ask them for help.  They're there for you, as you would be for them.",3

Anxiety,qc52lt,hi08zhu,"Thanks so much for the kind comments. I start talk therapy on thursday morning and I'm actually looking forward to it. The Sertraline is slowly kicking in too which feels kinda weird, like my body is tingling. Sleep is difficult but I am slightly less anxious so I can't really complain much. I just wish I had started this whole process 7 years ago. Would have saved me so much money and misery.",1
Anxiety,qc52lt,hmiwyy7,It was rough but not as bad as I feared it would be. You just gotta accept you are going to barely sleep for the first week. After that you start sleeping more but then the night sweats and crazy dreams start. This lasted about a month but then after that I started sleeping totally normally again. It was all worth it and I actually look forward to dreaming now and waking up feeling refreshed.,1
Anxiety,qc52lt,hi0d9fg,I felt the same way when I started anxiety medication—like I would’ve saved myself so much misery if I had gone on it sooner. All we can do now is move forward :),2

I can't shake the feeling that we're going to be mental health issues at an unprecedented scale. At the best of times, only one in three people with mental health issues seek help. Right now, I'd fathom it's a lot fewer.

I’m still going to work but all of my after work activities have stopped,  so now when I get home I just work on the stuff I’m trying to learn.  I play 2 instruments (one not very well but I’m learning), and I’m also learning to draw, and since the quarantine I’ve started doing yoga every day with videos from YouTube.  I’ve had back pain for almost a year now because of a slipped disc and the quarantine has finally given me the time to actually do something about it.  

Another factor for me is that when this started both of my roommates went to stay with other people, so I’ve been home alone too, which is way less stressful for me.  I can make as much noise as I want at whatever times I want, which is nice.

I haven’t seen my fiancé in over a week at this point, since someone at my work got covid-19 I’ve been self quarantining and only going to work and home.  I miss him, but it has been interesting to see all the other ways I could spend that time that I was spending with him.  He has his own stuff he’s working on, he plays 4 instruments and he’s started meditating every day with an app, so he’s not too distressed about it either despite him not even leaving home to go to work since he works from home now.

I recently moved before this so all the expectations I would put on myself to go out and make friends and have a life have been lifted, which has helped with the depression. I also am not as concerned about failing to build my portfolio as work has reduced vastly, so it's not my failure.

But i can understand it would be worse for others, so i sympathise with you all.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmudhl2,"It’s gotten worse. This past 5 months my mental health has been great! I got put on this medication which as been helping. I’ve been super happy and been super motivated. Then quarantine happened and I’ve been super unmotivated. I just feel like shit all the time, I honestly haven’t felt this depressed for years. I miss my friends and my boyfriend. Also, I can’t get ahold of my therapist for some reason. She won’t respond to my calls.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmudp9y,Wouldn't be surprised,1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuegaq,I took a survey of around 200 college students and 94% said their mental health had decreased as a result of the quarantine,1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmufs52,Don’t know if it’s related but yeah mine has definitely been worse than usual,1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmugqc4,"It mostly depends on the person. But from what's going on around me i would agree. This year has just been a lot of bad news for me and my family so far though. Try going outside if you can, or just sit in front of the window.  Also surround yourself with more upbeat people or people that care about you alot. If not in person by internet. Im not a professional but i hope this helps you.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmukqgg,"Mine has def improved. I’m a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.

During the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. 

Age 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to “rapid cycle”...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I’m really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It’s saved my life.

On the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. 

During the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can’t due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it’s bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I’m getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. 

So yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I’m on an assembly line it’s all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can’t do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I’m only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won’t be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I’m right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don’t know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I’m gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. 

So now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it’s sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don’t know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.

So, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I’m super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmunep6,Yea,1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuoadu,"Mine's always been horrible

It's still horrible

Am I gonna go into cardiac arrest any minute? Probably.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuobmc,"I feel like my depression has gotten a little better since I am getting to spend more time with my daughter, but on the flip side of that, spending more time with my daughter has my anxiety at full tilt.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuor4g,"Yeah man.  Idk if it just feels easier for some (and is actually jeopardising their recovery) or if it actually benefits some, but my mental health is taking a hit.

Uni moved online, now can't keep up with material and assessments, nor can I work sitting in the same place all day in my room, so I just dropped all the subjects (real shame because this was the first in like 4 semesters I was actually making progress and looking to sit some exams), the gym closed so all those goals are kinda fucked - fitness also because I can't really run too regularly because of my feet - and the mental health benefits of doing shit has gone, I don't get outside enough and in general am just flattening quite a bit.

Thing is it's not wasted time.  In times where you can't do things, improve, expose yourself to new experiences, maintain some of your hobbies, exercise fully or even work, you can always practice mindfulness - in fact this is the best time to do so.

It's important just to keep a few good habits going:

Brushing your teeth/ washing daily

Eating regularly and focus on nutrition (try to get enough healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants in your day and avoid processed sugars and saturated fats - especially as being in quarantine, these sugars and sat fats just weaken your tolerance to life).  Maybe you can even hit a caloric defecit and lose some fat if you want, although not recommended for weight trainers who want to maintain muscle mass.

Exercising - go for a run, do some pushups every 2nd hour, some Turkish getups maybe, single leg squats etc. This really revolutionizes your mindset for days even after one thing (one set of pushups at max reps at the start of the day can make the difference between a good day and a shit one).

Outside - go for a walk or sit in the sun for any amount of time.  This does a similar thing as exercising.

Any discipline - people don't like doing nothing.  We like to think we like doing nothing so that we trick ourselves into being motivated to do things with the promise of respite afterwards, but we only like recovering from hard work, not doing nothing.  For this reason, it is much more beneficial to read stimulating material, learn things in depth or generally improve at things - vegetating on the couch watching netflix or gaming (not all gaming ofc) will just lower your resilience and generally decrease your sense of purpose.

Instead, try to find something you want to do, or have been meaning to do but been putting off, and focus all other energy on that.  Of course if you have just about any solid responsibility in this time, most of your resources will probably will be preoccupied with dealing with that.  If you have few commitments though, finding something productive is a great way to make use of your time.

For me, I've been meaning to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn for a while - maybe I'll read war and piece.  I've been reading Aurelius, and have been wanting to read up on Epictetus.  Similarly I've been practicing my trumpet improv which needs a lot of work, and bettering my poker game.  I still have a few things to do with uni (study some prerequesites but also just general academic interests) so I've been doing that too.

These probably won't apply to you, but the point is if I do all of these (in order), it becomes a lot harder to have a bad day.  If I have a bad day, it's normally because I have failed to do one of the things, and really that is just a lack of discipline.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmup2nn,"Mine has gotten significantly better!! Because I no longer have to go to work every day and fake a smile 24/7, drain myself verbally and mentally keeping small talk with older clients and coworkers, physically try to walk around like I don’t have a weight on my shoulders nobody can see(my mom is a high functioning suicidal alcoholic with a xanax prescription she abuses, and verbally abuses me though I literally do every thing for her including cooking all of her meals and cleaning her room/the apartment, and is currently living with my bf and I as my dad recently split from her and he no longer is there to keep an eye on her/monitor her drinking and suicidal ideation, and my older brother no longer cares). Simply not having to act like I am happy when I am severely depressed with generalized anxiety(and on medication + doing biofeedback on myself at work), and also deal with work stressors, has been life changing. 

I love my job, and at my lowest points it was/is the thing that keeps me going. But the rude parents and lower end spectrum clients I work with can be so hard to work with(keeping that fake smile) 5 days a week with such difficult personal life problems. I was also working overtime on top of this for the last three months(mom moved in 4 months ago), so I don’t get home till about 7:30-8 most nights when I’m at work by 9-9:30 am. Eating dinner that late after I cook it, and it sometimes being my only real meal of the day was just another thing bringing me down. Now I have time to make food and actually enjoy eating it!

Things are hard at home sometimes, but if I isolate myself in my room and avoid my mom at all costs/bite my tongue, things are pretty damn good. I’ve been quarantined along with all of them(we all got over the virus!) for over four weeks and I couldn’t be happier.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuu6rm,"Kinda??? On one hand, my relationship with my family is extremely unstable, like one moment you and your dad are good, your stepmom isn't in a bad mood and feels like making her stepchildren suffer with her and your stepbrothers aren't constantly screaming and fighting each other so you don't have to calm things down (or scream at them to stop because your on the last line) because your dad expects you to be the good ""older sister"", next moment, boom, you're all on thin ice. Just making a single noise would lead to everyone screaming at you. And I end up having to take my anger out on literally anything because of being so constantly exhausted. Like my bro just asks where the milk is and I end up being pissed at him for no reason.

But then again, I now have time to write and draw, and that's a good output for all my pent up emotions that I'm not allowed to talk about or show. So it's a 50 good and 50 bad.",1

mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuvyvs,"in some ways, it's gotten better and in some ways it's worse, but reminding myself of everything good keeps me sane. right now i can hear the rain tapping against my window while i'm drinking tea and procrastinating on studying for math. it's peaceful, even though i'm surrounded by lots of far less peaceful stuff. and if i need to talk to someone, there are the people in my life who i trust, as well as online resources ([this one](https://www.7cups.com/18399456) is my favorite, if it helps anyone!) and sure, life sucks in a lot of ways and i don't want to downplay that. but there are the little things that i hold onto, and those tiny things help remind me of why i'm going to be okay and strong.

mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmuyinm,"Yeah mine too. I was starting to enter a depressive episode at the start of all this, and now it’s gone from 0-100 in two weeks it feels like.

I'm trying to set a certain schedule for me but all my brain wants to do is watch Netflix. I'm watching pretty good shows.",1
mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fmxg8hk,"I LOVE and flourish at both of my jobs and can't wait to get back to them when things settle down, but when things got shut down it felt like a load off my shoulders; a break to catch my breath a bit. Even though I'm an extrovert, the idea of staying at home for a bit seemed like a vacation, but without the annoying bits of going through an airport or finding someone to watch the dogs.

My partner wasn't affected by the transition to work from home, so they're still working a regular 9-5 schedule. So worrying about how we're going to pay the mortgage or buy groceries is thankfully not something that I worry about. 

At the start I was crazy productive doing things around that house that I have been meaning to do for ages, started a garden, sanded and restained the outdoor furniture, cleaned the garage... so many things. That was Mid-March?

Now, I'm still forcing myself to do things. Cook dinner, clean the house, make the bed, laundry, mow the yard/misc. yard work, all necessary errands (grocery shopping, picking up dog's medications, etc.) but I'm crying at the drop of a hat. I feel so overwhelmed and drowning, but I don't know what I'm drowning in, if that makes sense.

So, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm doing. I thought I was doing okay, but now I don't know. I come from a long history of depression and the past few years, after I quit a terrible career and transitioned into a 180\* opposite career, have been the most stable, happy, and optimistic I've been since I was 14? And I'm now in my mid-30s.

I’m a single guy, living a lone, not able to visit my parents across town because I would hate for them to become ill if I am carrying the virus.  Not being in a relationship, and the prospect of not finding a partner in a bar or coffee shop has this feeling like a really lonely time right now.

People don't even text to arrange a phone call time so I could prepare even though I keep asking for that.

The thoughts always relate to someone doing better than me in life and that I have let my life pass me by. However, I have struggled sine I was young with my thoughts and they really took hold of me. Despite my negative thoughts I have achieved things in my life but I unfairly compare myself to other people. But now, thanks to therapy I am coping better.

mentalhealth,fx2qdr,fp3tsuc,"My anxiety has also gotten so bad that I consider it paranoia. This isn’t the first time, but this is definitely the worst. I went through a patch about 2 weeks ago where I was convinced that I was being poisoned (and it coincided with bad acid reflux which didn’t help) and when this happens I STRUGGLE to take my medication which obviously just makes everything worse. I was also convinced that my mother and my cat were spying on me and constantly watching me. 

I am also TERRIFIED to leave the house. Even just going outside into my garden was really difficult at first. If I had planned a supper and I didn’t have an ingredient, I would change my whole meal instead of going to the small shop down the road which almost always has no people in it. I also can’t wear an n95 mask because I don’t like anything touching my face and I feel like I can’t breathe in them and that sets off an panic attack. 

Luckily the paranoia has (mostly) passes but the anxiety is still VERY REAL. I hope you feel less alone now. And if anyone has any tips, please share!",1

While the state I currently live in, NM, seems to be handling the whole thing better than some, I've been appalled by the lack of care from most that live here in this stateline community. Being right next to TX, there exists that more militant ""my rights"" type of mindset that some just have to be proudly vocal of. Of course I've been dealing with that on some level since moving out here eight years ago. So again, really thinking the next best thing once this all settles down a bit is to run with my move into a further remote area.

Of course apart from a small subsistence garden, I'll probably have to look into some other profession that doesn't require leaving the future homestead much. Kind of a hard thing in and of itself to do when I barely graduated high school 19 years ago and have only recently managed to get my footing in a troubling subject like college algebra.

mentalhealth,1mfca12,n7d0ibb,"Playing the devil's advocate here, and I don't want to dismiss anyone's struggles...

But... I believe a lot of that frustration comes from seeing what they view as a growing culture of helplessness, where victimhood is becoming a badge of honor, so to speak.

Many of them come from a time — and mindset — where mental hardship wasn’t something you talked about publicly; not even to your best mates. You kept your head down, did your job, and found strength/coping through responsibility. So when they hear people say, *‘I can’t work because of anxiety,’* they interpret that as avoidance rather than an illness. It’s not always purely out of  cruelty — it’s an attitude towards mental health shaped by different values and ultimately, a different era.

I think for a lot of them, discipline, personal responsibility, and grinding through mental hardships are forms of therapy — something that gives structure, self-worth, and personal independence. That’s why they push back hard on what they see as excuses or dependence on government support etc..

That said, the tone they use can come off as insensitive or hostile. But at the core, many (not all) just believe people rise by confronting adversity and not stepping away from it. They don’t see mental health as a ‘pass,' they see it as a challenge to be overcome.

mentalhealth,1jrpkb0,mmkr0q9,"this is such a thoughtful question! i think we’re witnessing the collision of multiple long-term stressors—cultural, economic, and psychological—that are uniquely intensified in this generation.

social media absolutely plays a role, but not just because of screen time. it’s rewired how we compare ourselves, how we seek validation, and how we experience connection. algorithms are designed to keep us scrolling by feeding emotional extremes, which over time can dull our nervous systems, disrupt attention spans, and distort our sense of self.

but beyond that, there’s this background noise of instability that’s been constant for over a decade now—economic uncertainty, political unrest, climate anxiety, a pandemic, rising living costs, fewer job opportunities, and a sense that traditional paths to a secure future are either broken or unreachable. we were told to dream big, but handed a world where even stability feels out of reach. that disconnect breeds existential fatigue.

also, we’re one of the most psychologically literate generations in history. we’ve been handed the vocabulary of mental health—trauma, burnout, depression, boundaries—but not always the tools, space, or systems to deal with it. we know what’s wrong. we just don’t always have the means to heal.

so yes, it’s real. something is happening to us. but being able to question it the way you are—that awareness—is part of the solution. when enough people start naming the problem, it becomes harder to ignore, and maybe easier to change.",1

2018 from when I was ""gay and mentally ill"" cus I forced myself to be depressed on Tumblr

I wasted my life

Ur fine mate. I used to wanna dissociate so I'd stare at the walls like wHaooh..ppl ruminate and make themselves sick. Half the time it's for power and control 

where I belong, why I always felt Different. I internalised societies endless restrictions, what it told me. Denied myself true understanding in order to conform to them. And my mental health suffered as a result 2018

Turns out I wanted to go beyond restriction and True understanding

mentalhealth,1jrpkb0,mlkfrcd,"to be honest, if u look at it, 200 yrs ago, all was asked of u is to grow up, work in ur father's farm and marry. there was no expectations out of this, there was no comparing ur life with anyone else, there was no succeeding beyond that. wake up, go to work, meet with friends, go back home, spend time with family, sleep and repeat

there was no "" im wasting my time "" cuz u cant, how r u going to waste time? counting soil grains? the whole community had the same routine, u'd automatically follow. everybody is satisfied cuz there's no satisfaction beyond wut they know. no one between them is filthy rich or under poverty line, most have the same status.

for me, going through many mental breakdowns and all kind of illnesses that made life harder, I wish I was born 200 yrs ago, or perhaps somewhere in this modern world, where all is expected of women is to take care of thier family and get taken care of. i wish i havent been told since my mom was pregnant with me that i gotta be someone successful and important and change the world. i wish i knew wut was expected of me and could easily do it, just like the rest of the culture i live in. like i have done enough and i'm enough. but now, with success and making money is so ingrained in my soul, every time i feel like i haven't become rich is me wasting resources on this earth, cuz success is all abt money and financial freedom. when i have no energy or will left for it, and my SI had been at its peak for 4 yrs.

I was given antidepressants and anti anxiety throughout my mid to late teens because nobody even considered what I actually have is AuDHD and a personality disorder, which a combination of which is the cause of the depressive/anxious symptoms.

And yeah, I also agree that part of it is sadly to do with the state of the world. Not that there weren't terrible things years back but social media has made information (and misinformation, ugh) more readily available and sharable than ever before.

Some ideas about the app:  
A big one--peer support.  People who have been there and want to help others.  That is crucial in recovery and I am working on getting fully trained in that area myself.

Links to resources--where can I find places to get treatment, where can I find social groups, or places that deal with psychiatric rehab and help people with employment, housing, etc.  In other words, a clubhouse model

Disclaimer that someone should call the crisis number (988 in US) in the event that they need immediate assistance or 911 for a medical emergency

A place to list support people--friends, family, etc so that they can be easily contacted as well as phone numbers for psychiatrist, therapist, and other professionals involved in treatment.

A visual that helps stay present in the moment. Or only focus on today. Not tomorrow. When someone tells me “I hope you feel better,” it makes me feel like I’m expected to get better. That I have to rush it. 

I don’t know how to explain it in a way that makes sense. 

Have a creative option to identify and describe what you’re feeling.

Ex:

- Sad or Angry or Depressed or Anxious?

Anxious.

- Which shape looks like anxious? 

Circle.

- What color is anxious?

Dark green.

- What size is anxious?

Big. 

And a pop-up empathetic statement: “that is a lot to carry inside. Let’s focus on getting through the day. You don’t have to be okay right now.”

Even if it's just the natural course of things and not necessarily a disorder. Learning how to handle negative emotions is also something to be desired as especially younger generations are not prepared for hardships, struggles and dealing with the negative emotions that might accompany those times.

mentalhealth,1gjetix,lvf9nen,"It can be beneficial to know if you have a diagnosis and/or if your therapist has a diagnosis for you. There is clarity in knowing you have a diagnosis but my comment was meant more in a general sense. A lot of clients tend to explain what they're experiencing and ask me if they have a disorder or that they've been Googling their symptoms and want an answer. Not everything we experience in life is a legitimate disorder. If there's a diagnosis to be had for you ask your therapist what they have concluded while working with you. What the treatment plan is and why and how they came to that diagnosis. It's perfectly OK to have an open discussion about thst, it's your right as a client. 

For example, someone could be experiencing intrusive and compulsive thoughts for a myriad of reasons but feel they need a diagnosis for answers or clarity. They might even feel they have OCD. But the reality is they could be under a lot of stress or a significant stressor is happening in their life causing those symptoms but they don't meet the full criteria for OCD. They can still work on ways to manage those symptoms and improve their wellbeing even if it doesn't come down to being diagnosed with a disorder. 

There's clients that hold a lot of identity or weight to a diagnosis that they're given and there's others that are informed of a diagnosis but don't put as much emphasis on it but work through the treatment plan just the same. I apologize if this is turning into a ramble and hope it makes a bit of sense.  Bottom line, don't let a diagnosis or lack of a diagnoses dictate how you choose to take care of your mental health.

Speak with a professional who can point you towards the most suitable kind of therapy and allow yourself to feel even when it hurts so bad you feel as if you can’t cope.. Sometimes medications are indicated for certain conditions or symptoms but that is something you would have to speak to a Doctor (most probably a psychiatrist) about.. And having read through the comments it’s fair to say there are lots of very effective ideas that work for some folks and not others so allow yourself to try various approaches and with trial and (hopefully very little) error you will find a combination of actions and resources which collectively aid you in your journey towards healing.. ❤️‍🩹,2

All other tools it offers - networking, showcasing a portfolio, selling products - have been squashed mostly by the users themselves, and by Instagram after that, pushing paid services to its front and leaving the breadcrumbs of reach to everyone else. Talking about mental health is no exception - it's become a trend there, like traising awareness about the environment, or discrimination, yet all you see there are mostly pretty quotes from people who just want to impress and appear like they are trying to save the world. Nobody shares actually useful information like studies/real-life stories/info on who to reach out to for help.

mentalhealth,mld4qm,gtlonyv,"I deleted Instagram bc I noticed the effect it had on my health. I thought it was because I was seeing the lives of ppl I knew. Then I tried Tiktok for a few weeks and realised it made me feel even worse than the few years I had Instagram for. I still use some social media, but it's much more limited, at least time wise. I have Snapchat purely for one group chat with my housemates. I use WhatsApp to talk to family, I use Discord, Reddit, Pinterest and Tumblr because the atmosphere is different and it's more of a way for me to engage with my actual interests. Social media doesn't have to be bad, but we need to recognise what makes it unhealthy for us, and when it is. I wish I had deleted Instagram earlier, and I wish I had never downloaded Tiktok, as deep down I knew it wouldn't be good for me. 

I'm not saying no one should use Tiktok or Instagram or quit all social media. If you delete it all, it's not like all of your problems will disappear, and your mental health won't automatically improve, although in my case it did lower my anxiety quite a bit. Social media can connect people if you use it right, but some platforms are less suited towards it, and it all depends on your mindset towards it too; I recognise that my mindset was unhealthy, and it's my responsibility to take care of it. Even now, I take a lot of breaks from social media and will delete social media apps on my phone whenever I recognise that I'm using it mindlessly or as a time filler; there are better things I can do that I enjoy more to fill my time.",11

I felt kind of silly about it at first but with some deeper thinking I’ve concluded that tik tok is just random Internet bullshit. Whereas (for me), Instagram is full of people I actually know. And it’s all a highlight reel. I watch my own friends post things that make their lives look so cool, but I know their real lives at home and all the bullshit. 

I follow people who I don’t even care about but I feel like it’s awkward to unfollow. I follow random accounts that I thought I’d enjoy but really I just don’t care. 

I myself was posting simply for attention. Posting stories of my food or my body while I’m at the gym. And the realization that nobody gives a fuck is both comforting but upsetting. You drain your own energy posting things that nobody cares about.

Ironically, I admit to using Reddit a lot but I feel like Reddit (the only social media I use besides YouTube) actually has a few things to offer if you use it correctly. Instagram, on the other hand, offers very little benefits and, to me, is a waste of time. I deleted my Instagram for that very reason and I’ve never had the urge to run back to it.

And like you mentioned, a lot of people use Instagram, specifically, in a very.... fake way. A lot of people use the platform to sort of virtue signal and show the best sides of them selves. And the worst part about it is the fact that no one cares. I’m not saying this in a belittling or mean way- I mean, when you see someone post something on Instagram, unless it’s actually interesting, you just continue scrolling. So, ultimately, you end up with a shit load of people thinking they’re posting something that people will stop and look at but, in reality, no one will. Everyone kinda lives in their own little bubble on Instagram and most people don’t even realize it. 

Adding on to what you already mentioned in your post, these are a few other reasons why I think Instagram is bad for mental health.",3
mentalhealth,mld4qm,gtn9c6x,"Popular social media especially since the pandemic has just been fucked man. When everyone was posting tiktoks and stories of them doing push ups and workout challenges last year was when I really got fed up.. purely because there’s no gym to go to so they rely on the constant validity of recognition and likes online.. I’ve gone through continuous phases of deleting social media apps, disabling accounts and hopefully will delete Facebook and Instagram accounts soon for good. I know so many people on there who are toxic assholes irl but praise mental health, posting quotes on their stories and I just sit back and think to myself I know who you really are. I find myself becoming toxic when I use it too much and it has even affected my relationship in the past on occasion. Its awful and the only people cut out for it are the ones who want to join in the fakeness competition of who’s life can look the best. Just a bunch of fake people. Sure some actually may have good intentions to spread awareness of vital news. But when we are in the generation of the self, predominantly all you will see on every account is a facade. The fact is everyone now is just too concerned with their egos when we are meant to be dealing with catastrophic global crises. Again, not just with mental health, but with global events, such as global warming or BLM, posting a black square or posting a dying species or forest on your story ain’t gonna do shit. Feels like this world is becoming a goddamn black mirror episode especially since tiktok blew up. Not to forget all these companies behind these modern social tech giants literally own, exploit and can sell your data in exchange for your free use of their service.

Someone on there obviously using some stolen pictures tried to get me to send money to them, and when I tried to report it, they didn't even have a box to click for Scam or Impersonation, so because the person didn't claim to be me, and I didn't know whose pictures they were using, there was nothing I could do to even have the account looked at.

I also remember following some hashtag, Motorhead I think, and it got me thousanda of posts in my feed of things that specifically wasn't motorhead, and no actual posts about motorhead. Just posts of literally every other band, every video that used music of vaguely similar kinds of music, makeup videos, sports I don't follow. And there was no way to make it stop, or in any way manifest my disapproval since there's no downvote, and commenting just boosts the post anyway. 

Not to even mention all the posts about self care and activism. Like, there's definitely a good point to having an open forum for discussion about important questions. But they never gave solutions to any problems, just vague encouragement, and sad-posts that look like something made with an AI or a random word generator. When I was at the worst stages of my mental illness, seeing shit on social media like that telling me to pull myself up by the bootstraps DEFINITELY didn't help.

So yea, I used it for 4 days, because literally everyone from my grandma to my then girlfriend to my workplace uses it, but I got so close to breaking my phone in half that I just had to quit it. I don't even think it allowed me to delete or hide the account. 0/10, wouldn't recommend.",1

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhcyxpt,"For multiple reasons. It also depends on the severity of your mental health issues. For example, if someone has unregulated bipolar, that's very difficult to deal with. When two people with mental health issues are in a relationship, that also causes problems. 

Relationships are difficult, period - because, as humans, we're innately flawed. Under the best of circumstances, we can try to communicate effectively...but throw in daily stressors, poor sleep, mental health issues etc. and it becomes more difficult. 

I don't think it's fair to say you're going to hurt or burden another person purely because you have mental health issues - and, frankly, I find it offensive that someone would suggest that. Mental health problems are often a lifelong struggle - and to suggest that anyone dealing with them should somehow ""spare"" others and avoid relationships is complete nonsense. 

My personal advice, as someone who struggles with crippling social anxiety, depression etc., is to continue being open and upfront about your mental health issues - and to make a concerted effort to prioritize good communication in all your interpersonal relationships.

That - and don't listen to people who apparently think you should just sequester yourself in some fortress of solitude and live in isolation for the rest of your life. Seriously, what absolute hogwash. I'm sorry but that's just ignorant.",185

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhd7cer,"As someone with depression and anxiety, it can be very difficult, **sometimes** impossible, to maintain a healthy, mature relationship with mental health issues in the mix. 

I've been with my husband 3 years and my issues have caused some serious toxic vibes in the past. He accepts me and helps me how he can, but at the end of the day I'm the one who has to manage myself. People with mental health struggles usually have a tendency to end up relying on and/or being dependent on their partner, and that is not healthy. 

Not everyone is at a point in their life where they have figured out how to manage their mental health and in those cases, yes, it's not a great idea to be trying to handle a relationship on top of everything else. Friendships are one thing, but a committed romantic relationship is a whole other ballgame. 

Yes, you CAN date and have relationships if you want, no one can stop you, but unless you've learned to manage your mental health, it's going to be a bumpy road that possibly ends in heartbreak. 

No one is saying that it means you can NEVER date or have a relationship. MOST people with depression/anxiety (not referring to other more series health issues here) learn to manage it over time, if not eventually overcome it completely. And many people with more serious issues also eventually find healthy management. 

Relationships, to succeed, require 2 equally mature adults who are both able to manage themselves and their own lives independently. Who are able to openly communicate **everything** and take care of their own stuff. If you aren't able to do these things on your own or even in your friendships, then no, you're not ready for a serious committed relationship.",15

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhdf6wh,"Sorted in this context means getting treatment. Mental health plays a huge role in romantic relationships. If you have issues in that regard, there will be problems, e. g. taking more than giving, lack of interest, making your partner your therapist etc. These are the things that will fail the relationship. Sometimes people realize they aren't actually compatible but sometimes they just realize the other party has issues they can't fix themselves. That's frustrating to live with so they break up. 

Personally I don't like the mindset of ""I'll tell them right away, so everything is fine"". First of all, people think they could handle it but will be wrong all the time. You can try your best but it will 100% affect the relationship. Prepare yourself to be broken up with a lot. Sure, it's not your fault, you told them, but who cares abt shit like that at the end of the day? Second, as someone who has no difficulties having a mentally ill partner, I'd absolutely start resenting you. You'd expect your partner to just live with you being difficult due to mental health issues but can't be arsed to seek treatment?

No, saying that someone will be a burden or doesn’t deserve love isn’t okay, but getting into a serious relationship when you have untreated mental health issues often won’t turn out okay either.

From personal experience, I think it can be selfish to get into a relationship if you have a severe untreated mental illness. It doesn’t matter if they know about it or they care about you.

A close friend gave these wise words, ""Love when you're ready, not because you're lonely."" And it's so hard to be alone but it  really struck a chord with me. 

I was infatuated with someone and they also shared similar feelings with me. We both have anxiety but I also have depression. 

I was more scared of myself because I felt like I could hurt them emotionally if my mental health crawled into an even darker state. They're the type of person who will support you no matter what and even though I would support them too, it felt like it would not have been balanced. I told her that she that I was not ready for a relationship. It was a little awkward for a week or two but we eventually went back to being the best of pals again.

You need genuine, healthy and loving people who care for you and even more than that you need to be a mentally and emotionally healthy person in order to have and keep these kinds of people around. I started off with that because if you are someone who is toxic because of your emotional and mental instability then it rubs off on others. A lot of people who struggle with these problems look to forming romantic relationships as a source of help and comfort. They use it as means to give themselves a sense of worth. Additionally, you can't genuinely love someone until you learn to love yourself. So when people say you shouldn't get in a relationship. Don't see it as you are meant to be forever alone because then you are taking up a victim mentality which is also in itself toxic but rather see it as motivation to try to improve your mental and emotional position.

I think it becomes an issue when you depend on your SO to solve all your issues and take the depression away, because that is an impossible task and so unfair to the person your dating/with. It also becomes an issue when your SO tries to be the all and mighty hero and save you from your depression (which my SO tried to be but we talked it out and now we’re good lol).

I was conscious of it but for some people who aren't, the amount of dependency you put on a person can turn abusive, so I think that's an important point as well.

When you're not mentally in the right space, it can harm the other person. Showing how little you love yourself can hurt them and potentially make them feel bad about themselves as well. If they have to worry everyday about losing you due to depression, it really will do stuff with their own health.

In my experience, mentally ill people can date, but they have to know how to handle themselves. Now that might sound ridiculous to people with BPD and other mood affecting disorders, but if you can't handle yourself even a little bit, a relationship just isn't possible. Even a little thing as saying sorry and working on yourself can do wonders, but you have to be willing to put in the work.",1

It’s not right now the relationship is dangerous (save for unmentioned verbal, physical or psychological abuse). Ultimately, this depression can end.

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhdwtit,"From some perspectives I understand it. I suffered panic attacks daily due to trauma, and was dating someone who had severe anxiety. Dating him gave me depression and anxiety myself, which I didn’t realise until it was too late. That or I always had them, and he just made it visible to me and make me plummet. His negative thinking really impacted me, and my mind was vulnerable to it due to the panic attacks. It made a really toxic relationship, as it ended up being two people caught in negative thinking cycles.

My opinion is, you can be in a relationship while suffering mental health issues. As long as you don’t take it out on your partner. The way I see it is, if you can learn to be in a relationship without letting your mental illness hurt someone else, then do it. Or at least tell them what’s going on with you.",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhdy04c,"I disagree with those people.

I was incredibly depressed BECAUSE I was single.  I was lonely.  I have friends and I kept myself busy, but there are some needs that only a significant other can fulfill.  I would go months without physical contact with another human being.  I’m pretty sure that isn’t good for anyone.

My depression has gotten a lot better and the only thing that’s changed is that I’m now in a relationship.  If I had listened to those people, I never would have gotten better.

Loneliness is a real thing and it can cause all kinds of symptoms, and the only cure for it is close relationships with other people",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhdz82f,"I think it all depends on how mentally stable you are.

I know a guy who had 10 girlfriend in the last 3 years. Each time it didn't go well. I met him about a year ago and got to watch things go down between him and a girl he was into.

His main reason for dating is that he thinks it will improve his mental health, give him motivation and increase his self esteem. He believes this to be 100% healthy but based on what I seen I couldn't disagree more so I'm gonna give a few examples:
-Blamed her for his mental health getting worse. What horrible thing did she do? She asked to get to know him before deciding if she wants to date him. Like he straight up told her that while knowing she has depression and didn't think that there was anything wrong with this.
-Claims to be putting her first but it always goes back to his needs. If he worries about her it's always because it will negatively affect him if she isn't in perfect condition.
-Cuddling 24/7 even if she say no cuz it helps his mental health.
-She wanted to cut her hair. Well she can't and he is going to ""save her"" because her cutting her hair will trigger his PTSD. She need to be exactly how he wants her to be. 
-GF= free therapist that NEEDS to be always there for him and support him all the time. 
-Him and suicide is like the boy who cried Woolf. I get that this ain't a nice thing to say but it happens like weekly at the very least and he refuses any help for it. At this point whenever he says he is going to attempt it, he might as well be telling me it's Wednesday and it's always her fault in someway. 
< At least one of them is happening at any given time.


I don't consider the guy to be mentally stable like at all. I am 100% against him dating anyone untill he gets better because of the stuff he does and how he acts.

If you're stable enough not to pull anything like the stuff I mentioned above then go for it. If you just struggle with mental health and needs comfort/help from time to time then that isn't a reason not to date. If the relationship is good like at lest most of the time then I don't think there is anything wrong.",1

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhe19pc,"It's because people are 1. horrible at wording things to say what they really mean, 2. don't know what they're getting into, and 3. projecting.

I think nowadays, most people realize that mental illnesses simply don't go away - rather, they're managed. But of course, we can't always predict when we'll be sent into a downward spiral. If someone told me that I shouldn't date until my mental health is sorted out, I'd tell them to fuck off, but if they told me not to start a new relationship while I'm in a bad place, I'd probably agree with them.

There's also the fact that everyone with a mental illness is different. Maybe this person dated someone with BPD who treated them like shit, or maybe their brother's depression is something they can't handle in a partner. They'll never know until they begin dating you, and that's scary for a potential partner, especially if they already have preconceived notions about your condition. Not dating someone with a mental illness is a boundary that people have a right to set, and honestly I think that's a good thing. Why would we want to date someone who doesn't have sympathy for what we're going through? 

People who say you shouldn't date while you're mentally ill may have been hurt by someone with a mental illness - maybe even themselves. But we have to remember that when people say these things, they can't speak for other people. They're just trying to justify their choices when in reality, ""I'm not interested in that person"" is a complete answer.",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhe1nmj,"I somewhat agree with such a statement, despite having a chronic mental health issue myself.

Both me and my partner do it at times, the important part is just that it doesn't go too far and we apologise if in the wrong. It can also give you a skewed perception of what is and isn't healthy. That being said, I don't agree with this statement but understand the sentiment of it. I will probably always have depression, anxiety/mental health issues - that doesn't mean I'm not capable or deserving of dating. However, if it was affecting me a certain way I may not be in the right place for dating until some help and treatment. It's not the mental health itself, but how the person is dealing with it at that point in their life. Sometimes it is important to work on yourself before you give so much to another person.
Everyone deserves to date. Everyone also deserves to put themselves first when needed.",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhe5awc,"One thing I'd say to start, dating and committed relationships are two very different things.  

I would argue that you shouldn't get yourself into a committed relationship until you've worked out most of your mental health stuff (or at the  very least have been in the process of working it out for a good while, therapy, psychiatry, etc.)  The reason for this is primarily that people who haven't sorted their own stuff out usually end up in very unhealthy relationships.  Either the relationships end up being co-dependent, enabling, abusive, or some combination of all of them.  Secondly, once you do get the majority of your mental health stuff figured out, it's likely you're going to look like a very different person.  It's common that when this happens either you are looking for a completely different type of person to be in a relationship with OR your partner doesn't like the new (albeit healthier and improved) you.  They may make you feel that you have to go back to that place of being unhealthy in order to keep them.  


Now dating on the other hand, I don't see anything wrong with.  So long as you're open with people that you're dating that you're not looking for any serious commitment or relationship, I don't see any major issues with casually dating while you're still trying to work out your stuff.",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhe66tj,"This is kind of a straw man. What I usually hear is that you should get your life in some sort of order before committing to a relationship. If you walk around with an untreated broken leg, you will be a burden for everyone you meet. However, if you go to the hospital and get a cast and focus on getting things sorted, that is a completely different situation and actually shows a lot of positive personality traits. This is the same for mental health. You can be impaired, but still function okay.

A relationship where you are the patient and your partner is the caregiver is not a healthy relationship.

However, if someone does say that you should be free of all mental ailments before you are ready for a relationship, then they are wrong.",1

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhee1o7,"Definitely agree it's hurtful, and if u are open about your struggles with mental health and are working on it, I think you have every right to date",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fheeomg,"I think a lot of people say it because they're presumptuous, and they should keep their opinions to themselves. But I also think there's a nugget of truth in there. People shouldn't put off relationships until their mental health is ""sorted"" because that's not a reality for most mental health issues, but people should be working on it. 

Some people use other people as coping mechanisms, and maybe some of the people that say this type of thing have been on the other side of that. Being with someone who's not working on their mental health at all but obviously needs to be is almost always going to make a bad romantic partner. When you're in denial about mental health, you're usually in denial about a lot of other stuff too, including how you're treating other people. 

But yeah, people without serious mental illness tend to think you just go to therapy for a couple months, or go to a psych and get a pill and ""cure"" it so they say ignorant shit like this without even realizing that they're basically telling people with mental health problems to put romantic relationships on hold indefinitely, and I think they should really stop.

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fheori0,"This is a really interesting discussion. The thing is I was in two separate relationships while at the worst of my mental health. 

One I had gotten into while I was still ok, and ended when I hit my rock bottom. I became a horrible toxic person when my depression and anxiety hit me. I didn't know how to handle what was going to. I was desperately asking the only person I had left for help they weren't willing/able to give me. When they left because they couldn't handle my bullshit (and yes I will call it bullshit, I wasn't handling anything appropraitely) anymore I had nothing left and was worse off than ever because I had never handled anything on my own before.

It was my current partner that helped pick up the pieces. Our relationship wasn't great at first, I was intent in destroying my life, we fought constantly, we were both stepping on eggshells. But, we managed. They held me together until I was able to start working on getting better. And now while I'm not 100% at least I'm not toxic and I can handle myself well enough.

Codependent relationships are usually the result of trauma bonding or two people using one another to medicate an unexamined wound. The result is often the deepening of the wound and the creation of patterns where the wound is mistaken as love, and create escalation of that pain. It’s not that “you’re broken so don’t go cutting people with your edges” but “trying to use love as a distraction or a bandaid won’t solve your own wound, it’ll only deepen it.”

Being alone might suck, but it also gives you a chance to look at the wounding, and to tend to it. The challenge of course is knowing when you’re “ready”, and no, it’s not when you’re “healed”, because as you said, no one ever really can be fully “healed”.",1

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhgc799,"Hmm. I think no small part of the confusion in this discussion is shaded by the major differences in a male and female experienced in dating. 

In dating, nothing is fair. Girls have value based almost entirely on their physical attractiveness. That is depended that on looks, but can be augmented with makeup and clothing, although it inevitably fades with age. There is a reason men of all ages usually want to date 22 year old women.

Men’s attractiveness is also partially based on looks, but is also largely based on status and wealth as well. Since it isn’t completely dependent in physical attractiveness, it can increase as one ages and accrues wealth. However, because it is always partially dependent of their ability to provide, mental health is a major concern.

As an overweight, depressed, adhd, and god knows what else loser who can’t even do their homework consistently, I am just not a viable partner for most basically all women. No one would ever want to carry my burdens, and I would never want to make someone else carry them.

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhddhki,"I wish i could give you an award.

I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year which caused me to develop anxiety and depression. My gf was depressed and always relied on me, constant reassurance; she got mad at me for stupid things and blamed it on her depression. She refused to get help, and claimed that ""You're the only one to help me fight my demons"".

I took the role of her therapist, since she had refused to get one, and I was constantly under tremendous pressure of worrying if she'd kill herself if I do something wrong - or break up with her. She didn't love herself, she gave all that love to me, but only when I listened to her. Depression and her problems became the only talking point for us.

I know her depression is not merely the cause of the manipulative and abusive behavior. I know that you can love a depressed person. I know that she was a manipulative asshole.

I am not stating that you cannot love a depressed person; but we have heard so many similar things in this subreddit. So many depressed people tend to get narcissistic in relationships, possibly because they have not felt love in a long time and desperately want to hold onto that.

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhh9ytu,"Exactly. I do think that it's important to be upfront about that; but then, I really feel communication is what makes or breaks any relationship - platonic or otherwise. 

Some people always think the grass is greener on the other side - and, at the first hurdle, jump ship. It's sad but, in a way, good riddance; I'd rather find out someone's not in it with something minor than find out the hard way when something big/impacting happens and they bail when you need them most, you know?",1
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhh9i0l,"I agree entirely tbh. I don't think people should be made to feel like they ""have to"" be in a relationship etc. to be socially acceptable. People are different and that should always be a free, personal choice. If anything, I think it's much better if someone who feels no need/desire to pair-bond doesn't do so - because that really would be unfair to their partner, more to any ensuing progeny. 

I get where you're coming from - and fwiw, I think it's good that you're so self-aware. For me, personally, relationships have always been difficult; regardless of whether they're platonic or romantic. I overthink and overanalyze everything to the Nth degree and my brain perpetually has too many tabs open. I sometimes feel exhausted with myself; so I try to really curtail that around others because I don't want to be an inconvenience.

But the thing is...have you ever bought a new video game and had that feeling of ""omg this is the BEST. GAME. EVER!!!!""? And no matter how many times you play it, you never get sick and tired of it? That's what it feels like to me when you're in a relationship with someone where, even when it's hard, even when there's ups and downs, you can't imagine your life without them.

Having said that...I definitely think it's better to side-step any kind of additional stressors - such as relationships can be and often are - when you feel like it's just not something you want, you know?",2
mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhh8eyx,"I respect that - and tbh, I think it's important to make a realistic self-assessment when you're struggling with any sort of mental illness. I can be really morose at times; and by now I've sort of figured out what I need to do to get through it. Sometimes it means I have to be alone for a while, to sort of focus on something unrelated to daily life in my spare time etc. 

The thing, though, is that people are different. Some people find relationships more stressful than others. For me, some people add to stress, some people diffuse it.

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhh84p4,"I disagree. Not only is that a highly subjective assessment, but I stand by my earlier point that having mental health issues isn't a reason for someone to arbitrarily say you shouldn't be in a relationship. There's a significant stigma attached to the mere concept of ""mental illness"" - as if it's somehow a nice way of saying someone is bat$hit crazy. 

Mental illness comes in a lot of different forms, obviously; and so does its impact on any one person, because no two people are exactly alike. To say that depression comes in 6 month attacks, as you say, is a gross over-generalization IMO.",1

mentalhealth,f2jkuf,fhhatbo,"Okay  just to clarify everything I said, is based on evidence based medical review, not a personal opinion.



[The association between relationships and mental health is clearly bidirectional, however, stronger effects are observed when mental health is the outcome and relationships are the predictor, suggesting that the causal arrow flows more strongly from relationships to mental health than vice versa. Moreover, improving relationships improves mental health, but improving mental health does not reliably improve relationships.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28813281/) 

As mentioned in this systemic review relationships have a strong impact on our mental health, it’s not about the other person but our own benefit, and centered around having better mental well being. 

Also, again this isn’t about my personal opinion, the definition of a depressive attack (which is statistically more prevalent) in the DSM is that it last for 6 months, several attacks within a short period of relapse time changes the diagnosis into major depressive order. 

Finally, much like a doctor would sometimes recommend you to stop exercise till an injury heals to prevent further in Jordan, some doctors might think you need a break from dating for a while and at the end of the day you can take that advice or ignore it, you still have autonomy, I’m just explaining the medical rational behind it which is built on lots of research",1

2. People also worry about being taken advantage of. Now, I heard no such thing in your post- I do not believe you are doing that. But people hate conflict, hate saying no.

mentalhealth,1m7tgoe,n4vg5cc,"Anxiety is feedback to get you back in alignment, it’s not you. Be careful declaring it as your identity. The reason you are triggered by what others do is because you have identified with it and we only defend what we identify with. Your job is not to collect health labels like Oscar awards but to get curious about you life and the feedback it’s giving you so you can become aware, get ciear and transcend those constraints. 

The anxiety stems from an event that the subcortical part of your brain has assigned a valence to. This occurs with the amygdala and then the hippocanpus retrieves those as you scan your environment searching in survival mode for anything that matches the original event to protect you. Now it doesn’t need to be exact to the original event, it can be as small as one thing that your brain has associated with the original event. A colour, a sound, a taste, a smell etc and boom you experience anxiety.

Anxiety can be dissolved but it requires a person to be willing and ready and unfortunately many are not ready to do more than manage poorly with it, They have tied their identity to it, declaring it ‘my anxiety’ like it’s a pet animal they carry around. This is often done out of ignorance or because they are getting an advantage out of identifying with it (attention, sympathy, etc) This is then reinforced by the medical field who will step a label on it ad they get kick backs from big pharma for selling anxiety meds. 

The real you is limitless, boundless, timeless and is not constrained by fear but operates from love. But few want to explore that with reflective awareness, they would rather stay attached to the story they are running and fall into denial, defensive reactions to anyone who challenges that story or the one that you can live life without being governed by anxiety.

Based on the answers you give, it could either place you at a 'healthy' state of mental health, or recognise that you may need some help and either provide links to services that offer advice and support or techniques to help with general anxiety etc. And if you score very highly on the questionnaire, in that you show signs of having some mental health struggles, it could recommend that you speak to your GP for solutions.

Everything still is left to the decision by the person who has a mental illness or drug problem, to realize they have one, and then seek help on their own (with no outside interference)... That really is not going to happen 90%+ of the time because the control of the drug in the mind or the mental illness in the mind, is so great, ""THAT"" in itself keeps those inflicted from ever making the right choice to get clean & get help !!

I deal with this right now in a wife of 25+ years of marriage. She just came out of 25 days incarceration for going ballistic on 4 Sheriff's Deputies April 15th after attacking me and a DVPO was given for me against her as well during that time !  They filed 2 charges against her for assault, she got out with 1 year supervised probation, time served,  and to undergo full mental health eval. Her doctor even gave me letter for courts then to wanting her to have such done. Know what results have been last 12 days she's been out?

She said she would get into treatment program if I dropped the DVPO  so we could communicate freely. Once that dropped, she went to her probation meeting the next week, and that Officer basically said she did not have to undergo any such program, as back in Feb when she was taken in then on an IVC to Davis Hospital, there was an analysis done then, but no program continued and she walked out after 72 hrs; and this stupid probation officer in Taylorsville was satisfied with that??? SO she only needs to serve out the remainder of year going to meet Officer monthly and pay some fees???

IVC happened in February of this year. About 60 days after, an attack on me occurred coming home from work, and she was posting violent, hateful crap on Facebook all day even prior,  and assault happened on 4 officers who came to my 911 call April 15th and home damage from that mess I still have to repair. And she is out of the woods yet again with nothing being done?  I told my lawyer then and Court Advocate why did the Judge/Courts not have this done while she was incarcerated, instead of leaving it to be done when she was released?

She is a Master Manipulator and so many people here cannot believe this happened, as she buddies-buddies up to this probation officer, they talk about her puzzles and coloring and on pre-announce visit when they came to the house 2 days ago, only wanting to see where she sleeps and nothing more?  Not even doing house inspection as was stated would occur under supervised probation rules !!",1

mentalhealth,uxn19y,ia0s1mk,"I do agree with you, because preventative care is as important for mental health as for physical health. It's just that it's a bit less tangible. With physical health, a doctor could say ""You have high blood pressure, you need to do x, y, and z."" With mental health, it's different. No matter what questions the doctor asks, if you think you're fine, you'll mostly answer that way. ""Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless lately?"" (Which is a question on most depression questionnaires) ""No, I'm fine."" Honestly, a lot of the more objective things are energy level, sleep quality, appetite, etc. (I'm mostly speaking about depression/anxiety) and doctors already ask about this. I think a better solution is doctors referring more patients to mental health services, even for relatively small things. My GP once responded to my complaint about fatigue that, since my blood work was fine, it must be anxiety. And then she never followed up. I thought, oh okay, it's just natural anxiety about starting uni, but it did end up being a larger issue that affected me for years. I'm not saying it's her fault, but doctors are slow to refer patients to mental health services because of the way the system is set up (not enough psychiatrists, GPs thinking it's separate from physical health, etc) For context, I'm Canadian.",3

Because people don’t understand that depression eats you alive all day every single day it’s not just a temporary emotion that goes away after a day or two.
(can’t just “snap out of it”/“stop thinking about it”) 

People assume that because they’re sad that their great aunt Gertrude died at 107 that is depression when it’s nowhere near it.

Because people think that long-term life altering, anxiety is the same thing as being nervous to walk into a job on the first day.

Because people think that if you catch a glimpse  of a shiny thing out of your peripheral vision and you turn around to see what it is then has to be ADHD. 

Because PTSD is used to define anything and everything that ever happened in your life from when you got stung by a bee playing in the backyard at seven years old and watching someone be brutally murdered are somehow the same thing..

Emotional numbness, maybe ADHD and OCD, I’ve never had a professional diagnosis because my parents and my school counsellor, who I asked for help exactly once, threw the issue to my parents. My parents rejected a psychological examination for me when I was younger. (I learnt this yesterday) Everyone around me just contributes to my suffering in some way, I hate them all and my mind is just contradicting itself and all that. I’m too tired to try to type it out anymore, I self-harmed today and my mind doesn’t let me think clearly half the time anyways.

I highly agree that mental health needs to be brought to the awareness of others. Adults just don’t get any of our issues sometimes, it is not reassuring to most when they say “It’ll get better” and “It’s only temporary” or anything of the sort. For me it just compounds this misery that is not being able to feel, like they’re saying: “This isn’t my problem, sort it out yourself”. While I haven’t been a victim of cyberbullying, I’ve seen the effects of physical bullying on others and it’s terrible. I just can’t figure anything out in my life anymore, I still care too much for others even though I don’t feel emotions, and they still tell me to pick up the loose ends myself when it’s certainly not working.

I don’t have any professional tips, I’m not a mental health professional, they usually feel too generic to be applied and I’m heavily struggling myself, but see if you can find someone who can understand and cares.

mentalhealth,iaoz80,g1pzaz7,"You can most definitely have mental health issues at 15. I’m 22 now but at 15 I had diagnosed severe depression and anxiety and had my first involuntary psychiatric hospital admission at that age because I was severely suicidal and had plans and intent and was in over a week against my will and was put on a bunch of medication. Therapy was briefly started and then stopped because I was moving countries. Started up again after more involuntary hospitalisations. I got diagnosed with other mental illnesses on top of depression at 18 and 22.

So you can most definitely have mental health problems at your age. Relying on alcohol probably isn’t the best coping mechanism as your brain is still forming - the brain is still forming I believe until your early 20s but I understand we turn to other ways to cope when we are having a hard time. 

Definitely don’t think you are faking at all so please don’t think that.",7

mentalhealth,iaoz80,g1sdqew,"When I was younger I had selective mutism which is a complex CHILDHOOD anxiety disorder that affects your ability to speak in certain social settings. Not only can children experience mental health issues, there are several disorders that affect mainly children. I honestly did not know there was a name for what I had til I was older so there are without a doubt many older adults who aren’t as educated about mental health today and tend to brush it off. One of the worst things you could possibly say to someone experiencing such an episode is “it’s all in your head.” I grew out of selective mutism when I was 7 but the social anxiety and phobia that is linked to it doesn’t just disappear. To tell you the truth, my mental health was at its worst when I was around 15-16. I’m now 20 and I still have social anxiety but I can tell you that I’m getting better as I continue to learn about myself, what I had, why I reacted the way I did. I also gave myself a break as you should too. Stay educated in mental health and whatever you suspect you might have it doesn’t hurt to get tested for it. You may need medication because a lot of disorder are caused by genetics or complications with your brain’s chemicals and you literally can’t control it.",3

mentalhealth,iaoz80,g1qkvag,"25 years ago, I was about your age, a little younger even, and was smoking about 1 pack a day, paid for the habit by selling drugs, and drank nearly every night.

I lost a really good uncle when I was younger, I was a victim of bullying most of my childhood, and had parents who loves me but didn't understand.

I tried to kill myself when I was 17 and after someone found me and brought me to the hospital, the doctor told me I was too young to be depressed and to get over it.

They didn't even call my parents, which meant I had to hide my neck for almost 2 months while the bruising went away.

I took the time to ask my mom for help, but they couldn't afford therapy or psychological help, so she found me a local priest who also happened to have his degree in psychology.

After a 3 hour conversation, without a single mention of being saved, or God/Jesus, he helped me understand that what I was feeling wasn't normal, but that it was up to me to ask for help, and to try my best every day for those who do love me, because if I left the world, I'd be missing all that is good in it.

I quit drinking alcohol, and slowly quit smoking cigarettes.  I kept up cannabis, as it helped with my anxiety, but I still had severe depression which it doesn't help with.  I've gone through a lot, am now in my 40s and married with two children of my own.

My oldest has never been bullied, and will have two parents who know how she feels and always listen to what they have to say, no matter how they feel.

There are good and bad moments all through life, and let me tell you that with the right mindset, the right mental tools, life is amazing and it can be without drugs and alcohol.

You need help, and you reached out here; as you can tell, people like us exist and thrive.  You just need to ask and others will always be ready to help.

Don't go at it alone, and make sure you talk openly with people you trust and those you know can find you help.

Take care OP",2
mentalhealth,iaoz80,g1qz7a3,"Young people can certain have mental problems and the most serious ones tend to start in the teens. Pretty much anyone with intelligence can have a variety of psychological problems and in my experience, the smarter you are the tougher life is. However, smart people also recover better from mental problems because they can apply their intelligence to solving problems better than others. 

Anyway, I have met a huge number of suicidal people, who actually killed themselves, have tried, think about it, talk about it, etc. All of that needs to be taken seriously because I have met people who I was talking to, who said a bunch of positive stuff, then killed themselves 15 minutes later. 

I work in psych, by the way, that's who I know all this stuff. 

Anyway, I would MUCH rather meet someone who ONLY TALKS about suicide, than actually wants to do it. I will talk to them ALL DAY with a smile on my face. Actually killing yourself is horrible and it's a very bad feeling to meet someone who commits suicide. 

However, what I tell people is that if a person is saying they want to kill themselves for ATTENTION why do they want that kind of attention? 

I enjoy loved ones paying attention to me. But, I want it to be for good things. I am funny, so I want people to laugh. I am smart, so I want them to be interested. I am a good artist. I am very smart and athletic, so I want them to be impressed. I am very generous and giving and not a selfish person, so I want some praise. I want positive attention!! 

I do not want people to see me as sick, crazy, heartbreaking, and so forth. So, people who talk about killing themselves, or hurt themselves, to get positive attention DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET ATTENTION and so they need help. 

What most such people want is for people to care what happens to them. But they end up communicating that in a scary way that turns people off, which just makes people not care to pay attention more. So, they need to develop new ways to communicate what they need. 

Also, some people are unlucky and they're a smart and sensitive person born into a family of stupid people. These stupid people will never been your equals and never talk to you as you like and need. So, that's when you need to find a positive peer group that you can talk to. 

Sometimes that's through therapy, making new friends, meetup groups, and stuff like that, if they have them near you.",2

mentalhealth,iaoz80,g1qngml,"Yes children and teenagers can have mental health issues. I'm 24 but have had depression for 10 years. I've had anxiety for about 6 years.

It has still affected me to this day to have not been in therapy the whole time. 

My best advice for you is to not use alcohol, I know you dont want to, but alcohol is a depressant and doesn't make you feel any better in the long run, especially at your age. Talk to your friends and family that you can trust. Some people are more receptive than others to listening to these things, find those people, talk to them, and be there for them as well. Talk to your school counselor. They're there for you. Talk to your doctor/parents/counselor (whoever will listen) about talking to a licensed therapist. The best kind of relief is venting about life to someone who has no connection to it and wont share your secrets (unless you're being suicidal, they'll call your parents and set a baker act for you where you'd be hospitalized). A therapist will sometimes help by giving you suggestions too, to help with whatever you're dealing with.

It can also let that hidden mental health issue come out. It could be something temporary, or something that you'll live the rest of your life with. Even if it's not real and just in your head, that would still be a problem that you could get help for. Being unchecked could make it worse.

Try downloading an app to meditate, making sure to drink lots of water, and going for a walk everyday to get fresh air.

Please try to get help from anyone who will listen. Depending on where you are from, it may be common practice to not diagnose you until you’re 18, because hormones can and will also have an impact on your mental health. (It does get a bit easier once puberty hormones have calmed down). 

I’m 26 now, diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 22. I’ve been consistently taking my medication for three years now. There are still periods that get really bad, but it gets better.

I had intensive nightmares of people being torn apart and demons and shit at 6 years old after my dad passed and was the sweetest little kid(compared to now lol) but had these weird freak out fits over the smallest shit like my socks fitting weirdly. Which I guess were warning signs. And then a year or so older than you i got hit with depression and being really disinterested in life for no reason. And at 20 I developed schizoaffective disorder.

I understand its hard for some families to take their children having mental issues seriously. Its issues that no one can see most of the time except yourself. I moved home at that time. My dad thought I was making up and acting out the the ways I was at first. It wasn't until it got so bad I was having this little seizure freak out episodes where I would just curl into a ball and hit myself in the head over and over that he was finally like oh okay maybe something is definitely wrong.

Im sorry your family has to be like that too. Don't wait on them though to understand what you are going through. The best you can do is explain whats going on with you as best you can. And then there is resources to get your own help. There's a lot of people that will help you especially at your age. Maybe once your family and stuff see you suddenly getting help from these external forces they will realize something is wrong.

You are too young to be going through this and you need to get help as soon as you can. You should be enjoying your teenage years not fighting mental illness. So Google up some resources to help you out. There's always first call for help and Nami and all that. Just Google either of those two to get you started and give them a call.

First, yes kids can have mental health issues for a variety of reasons such as history of abuse, family neglect, and so on. Second, I feel that some mental health issues manifest themselves at puberty. I'm not saying that's true for everyone, but it certainly was true for me. My first episode that got my parents attention to be aware that I even had mental health issues was when I was 15 or 16 when I put a knife to my chest in front of the family during a heated argument. As I've learned over the years, I have a family history of what I now know is a common trifecta of mental health issues in depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This seems to be hereditary, and almost always manifests itself at puberty in everyone. Until very recently, I was always guarded to the idea of having kids, and subjecting another generation of the bloodline to that same problem as a result. I'm only now changing my mind for reasons that have nothing to do with the topic at hand.",1

mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md965qu,"I found my answer!

I'll give the short story

I worked at a very toxic environment. The boss was discriminatory against me being a parent and just didn't like me in general. It got to the point that I was becoming a bad husband and even worse father. 

The pay was great; but I only averaged about maybe 2500 steps.  (<<< HANG ON TO THIS)

NOW.  I am a janitor at a hospital. Everyday; I know what my job is.  Not stressing about how to pre- plan and adjust.  I just go.  Having an amazing boss to help with my child care situation is also a huge plus.

As for steps; I'm averaging about 10k; according to my pedometer. I want to verify it to be sure though.

So here is the condensation.
- Changed my work environment to a stress free
- took care of my family
- found an amazing boss who actually cares. 
- My anxiety and depression pretty much evaporated. The only thing I am stressin' about is pay.  ( going from 19\hr to 15.30 kind of hurts)
  

That's what I did! 
There is more to this but I wanted to keep this shortish!",10
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md94jwb,"Managing and dealing with anxiety and depression is a problem I’ve had all my life and I’ve found a multi faceted approach helps. Medication is one option. CBT is one option but there are many more. The number one practice that helps is exercise. I know - we hear this all the time but there is much research behind it. Over the years I’ve found therapy helps, spirituality/ philosophy practices helps, deep breathing , meditation, trauma work, boundaries, CBT. One of the most helpful is acceptance- working with these conditions instead of struggling to get “rid of it.” Internal Family Systems therapy helps with acceptance and understanding emotions. A good book is No Bad Parts by the founder of IFS.",4
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md91wu4,"I was on a cocktail of sertraline 25 mg, wellbutrin XR 150 mg, and vitamin D back in 2022. My vitamin D levels were dangerously low when I got a blood test and my psychiatrist told me that it was a huge contributing factor to my depression. That helped me so much along with therapy, hiring cleaners to deep clean my apartment, exercising daily, and leaving the house daily even if I didn’t feel like it…just being around people in the grocery store helped!",2
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md98gpp,"I like DBT especially if cognitive wasn’t very helpful because it gave very specific and literal suggestions 

There’s a skill called opposite action in dbt. It’s essentially just doing the opposite of what you want to when you should be doing something good for you like if you only want to lay in bed all day then stand up and take a walk. It’s obviously not easy in reality but I find it does make things easier one step at a time. 

Also setting like “the best I can do” goals. Being realistic about how much you can accomplish. Like the same ex of laying in bed all day. Sometimes you know outside doing things isn’t possible so all your best is eating and drinking water. It also builds up steps",1

mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md9bi3h,"I am a women and believe many of my challenges stem from me being female/women. I am also middle aged and have been living with this issue for 25+ years. What I’ve learned has helped me over the years:

Therapy - helps to recognize the reasons you think and react, and should give you tools to soothe yourself and to give you the confidence to change situations if they are working against your wellbeing. Also provides an outlet and connection.

Physical health - lots of parts to this. Exercise is great. I’ve exercised my entire life until the past four years where a medical issue affected my ability to. My anxiety levels are the lowest they’ve ever been right now though (without daily exercise.) My hormone levels are changing (lots of my most intense anxious periods when I was younger were due to fluctuations due to childbirth and breastfeeding) so a doctor is working with me to replace what I need. They also run regular bloodwork to check my thyroid and iron levels, both can cause symptoms. My iron was dangerously low but supplementation got it up to normal. I have migraines so do biofeedback therapy to help me with relaxation skills. SLEEP! When I do not sleep well, I have a horrible day. Eating well - not a special diet, but I make sure I eat consistently throughout the day. If I don’t, I have physical symptoms that trigger my anxiety. 

Environment - Over the years my situation has affected my levels of stress and anxiety. Shitty jobs, home life inequity (overload), public health and safety - all makes it worse. I’ve made changes to be as happy and comfortable as possible at the time. Boundaries with people who make it worse - Therapy helped me to realize this was possible. I no longer have contact with people, including family, who make me feel horrible. This has helped immensely.",1

mentalhealth,1irkuvx,md9mvte,"I stopped working (retired young) & I don't go out into crowded/populated areas as much, which **removed myself from toxic environments and people**. I prefer outdoors/nature surroundings over humans. 😆 

Speaking of toxic... I **got out of a toxic relationship** with a narcissist & rid myself of drama-bringers. I have my **own home** so if I ever do find myself in a bad relationship or whatever, I can end it and kick em out without having to leave, move out, or start over. 

I've paid off all but 2 debts (one of which is my mortgage) & **minimize financial stress** by avoiding debt & setting aside funds that support my hobbies/activities, which in turn makes me feel good about myself. 

I **don't use social media** as much anymore. I've begun downloading my data and deleting accounts to live a private & uncompromised life...

I've gotten myself a **crap-ton of hobbies/activities** (and all the equipment/supplies that come with it), so if I'm burnt out on one, I still have others to fall back on. Some are quick-types that act as interruptors to my anxiety or that keep my hands busy. Others are deep-delving rabbitholes to keep my mind fully engaged for when I find myself spiraling or losing myself in negative thought processes. 

When depression hits and I have no motivation/energy to care for/about myself, I have other living things (**pets & plants**) that get me out of bed & bring out the nurturer in me... they help keep me grounded to the present as well as improve my mood, plus they're often entertaining. 😆 

I've regained a **sense of faith**... I not only have an altar dedicated to that faith, but an entire loft's dedicated to my craft. It's where my indoor plants are, and it's also my cozy area to do some reading on my kindle while a chubby squirrel (and birds) outside my window curiously watches me, watching them.

They say excercise helps, but considering that my previous lifestyle was heavily on the physical side and extremely chaotic (military), I don't go out of my way to get those dopamine/adrenaline hits. I'm able to **stay physically & mentally active** in the comfort of my own home/neighborhood.",1
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,mdaiouh,"I took sertraline for two months which also caused me to feel like a zombie so I stopped taking it. I thought I could get better by myself (lol I was so wrong). I was exponentially very slowly getting worse by each month with my anxiety hitting me form left and right. At some point when I came back home (I did gap year from uni), I started only laying in my bed and crying everyday. Exhausted with life I went to a psychiatrist whom I told I don’t want to take medication and she prescribed I go to group therapy. I already did individual therapy for two years before but because it was psychodynamic type of therapy, it didn’t help me much in the long run. I stayed going to group therapy and it was difficult at first and very frustrating but now I’m like 2.5 months in and it really helped me. Firstly establishing a routine where I go there everyday and for 4 hours I think about how to get better already made a difference for me. Secondly I read “all about love” by Bell Hooks at the start of this therapy. It was a random pick but, while I don’t agree with some takes in this book, it was very enlightening to me. It made me realise that I am the only one who can make myself feel better and it’s not a matter of “feeling” it but a choice. So I went to that therapy with that mindset that I am CHOOSING to feel better no matter what my head will tell me I will be there for myself. Thirdly being in a group made me open up myself to people (I struggled with social anxiety and painful shyness). And this therapy challenged my thinking patterns a lot. Patterns that I thought were obvious and not harmful turned out to be the core of my issues lol. Fourthly, I also started going to the gym as the therapy progressed. I guess that mindset that I CHOOSE to get better really did a lot for me. Obviously I didn’t just get up one day and went to the gym from being in my bed 24/7 lol. I just kept on repeating in my head no matter how anxious I felt, that I am here for myself and I am choosing to be there and choosing to get better. I don’t know your story but for me a lot of anxiety and depression came from repressed anger and this therapy is also working on unpacking that anger in a healthy way. I hope that you will find a way to get better!! Remember that you won’t feel like this forever and some things take time and consistency to work :)) if you wanna talk, feel free to message me",1
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,mdawyc5,"I’m hesitant to even share this because I’m fully aware this isn’t a healthy coping mechanism at all… but it works for me, soooo… disclaimer/trigger warning: this is dark. 

When I am at my absolute lowest, close to ending it all, I force myself to recall memories of my parents at my sister’s grave after she passed away. I try to remember the vivid details of my dad’s glassy eyes and my mom crying. I think of them and I remind myself that, as long as they’re alive, I will not be the cause of that pain. I refuse to be the reason they have to bury another child and suffer like that again. 

Of course it’s painful for me to remember this and to imagine them at my funeral, but it’s quite literally the only reason I haven’t - and won’t - end my life. As long as they’re alive, I will stay here for them. 

Now, I recognize this is an unhealthy coping mechanism for many reasons (tying your reason for living to other people is always risky), but it’s better than the alternative.",1
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,mdb04xc,"I was finally diagnosed with depression at age 24 and started on meds, which helped.   I'd struggled massively for close to 15 years before that, beginning around age 10.

Over the next 15 years I tried multiple meds alone and in combination of almost every class of antidepressants.   Tricyclics, SSRIs, atypicals.   Added on meds like propranolol foot anxiety.   Therapy.  CBT helped me a lot (not a cure, but with tons of practice over a long tume I learned a lot of positive coping mechanisms for my anxiety).

Things finally improved when a small dose of an antipsychotic was added in to boost the tricyclic that worked best til then.

Eventually switched to an SNRI AND left my abusive now ex. 

That last combination (new med plus new life) was finally my turning point.  

My depression is severe, cyclical, and ongoing.   Part of it is genetic.  Part of it was situational.   There is no one magic bullet, but willingness to change and try new things over a lifetime finally made the difference for me.   I wish I hadn't had to struggle for 35 years before finding it but the past ten have been my best ever.  I never plan to go off meds again.   I'm looking into more therapy (EMDR this time).",1

But maybe simple things such as diet If you feel you don’t eat much veggies/fruit. And again, sleep. I’ve been feeling so much better.",1
mentalhealth,1irkuvx,mdbum16,"For me, my depression and anxiety stemmed from childhood trauma, which brought me to also having CPTSD. For me, it’s various things that help. Yoga has genuinely saved my life, I like yin yoga a lot too, when I first ever did yoga, I didn’t get it, I think I was soo disconnected to my body that I couldn’t feel the benefits until I finally began to truly connect with my body. I do therapy weekly, I eat healthy, complex carbs, veg, healthy fats, fruit, protein, water water water, nature walks ( phone in pocket, paying attention to my surroundings ) magnesium glycinate, omega 3, b complex, zinc, salt water baths, breath work, guided meditations, putting phone down an hour before bed atleast, or atleast put the screen on night mode from 7-8pm onwards to stop the blue light, reading books I feel drawn to reading, Happy Vibes Happy Life by Vex King was a good one, currently reading from surviving to thriving by Pete Walker. Crying when I need to cry, feel angry when I need to feel angry, sitting in my emotions, not running from them via substance or doom scrolling on my phone. I quit drinking alcohol, vaping and 🍃 which at first was very hard but now I truly love sobriety, less screen time, saying no to others when I need time out rather than saying yes all the time and burning myself out.  

It was a gradual process all this. First of all I quit substances one by one, then I started yoga, then I began weekly trauma therapy, then meditation, then I changed my diet and began walking more in nature and lowering my screen time etc. Start one thing and usually you will feel called to other things that will help you. For me, I have to keep doing these things, if I go back to old habits like doom scrolling or stop doing yoga, stop eating healthy etc etc, I can start to plummet mentally, I have to forever nurture myself with all these things but that’s ok because I love doing it all. Some weeks are hard when I am releasing trauma like after a hard therapy session but all worth it. Doctors need to start asking people what their diets look like, if they move there body enough, how much screen time they have, what their bedtime routines look like, antidepressants are not going to fix everything and they are so quick to give out antidepressants, yes they can help give you that lift to start doing things to help yourself but rarely do they completely stop anxiety, depression etc, and for many they just numb your emotions, they numbed mine.

\- are you at least walking for 30 minutes 3-5 times per week? Even better to do more vigorous exercise 3-5 times per week  
\- are you eating whole foods vs. processed foods? Super important. Fruits and vegetables have helped me personally a lot. Always opt for organic vs. conventional. You don't want pesticides in your body. They are not helpful.   
\- are you able to talk to someone (e.g. a therapist) about your struggles and issues? Finding professional help is important if you feel you are struggling from mental health issues   
\- are you meditating? Meditation is very beneficial for your mental health but also for your physical health as well.   
\- avoid alcohol and other drugs - they are generally not good for your mental health   
\- make sure you are not exposed to chemicals that can be harmful (a lot of household chemicals can be harmful - -e.g. air fresheners).   
\- are you getting enough nutrients and vitamins? (https://www.meruhealth.com/blog/most-common-nutrient-deficiencies-and-their-impact-on-mental-health) (I work for this company)   
\- talk to a mental health professional about medication if you still feel you need medication after you've addressed all these other things. 

Hope this helps!",1

mentalhealth,1irkuvx,mdaxrgg,"Technically, you’re both right. The real answer is that medication works best in combination with therapy. Medication alone is not nearly as effective (and can actually be harmful if not monitored properly), but studies show that therapy paired with medication is more effective than therapy alone. 

Of course this can vary greatly depending on the person/circumstances, but in general, there’s a lot of research showing that medication and therapy work best in tandem. 

Side note: when it comes to medications, it is true that many are over-prescribed, under-monitored, and are used as a long-term solution when they’re really supposed to be used for 6 months or less.",1

I guess it’s just the frustration some of us feel when people say that their symptoms recede so rapidly because for a lot of us they don’t recede to a meaningful amount to promote enough of a feeling of well being to matter. We all have different levels of dysfunction so some people see meaningful change in 2 years while the rest of us haven’t seen it in 10+ years.

I relate to the depression and anxiety, it is what I was originally diagnosed with before my current diagnosis. You got this! You’ve probably been struggling with this for a while and you are strong for getting this far! You just got to keep on fixing yourself and letting yourself grow. It seems like you have a good support system. Definitely lean on that for your own sake. 

My depression outside of bipolar went away via medication and exposure therapy. Going out and finding hobbies. I still have bad anxiety, but it’s better because my depression got better. The two are kind of tied together. Of course, what works for me doesn’t mean it will work for you, but that’s where a professional can come in and help.

mentalhealth,1n2wmy9,nb9f6tn,"I spent two weeks in a psych ward when I was your age (I’m 36 now). Frankly, I don’t remember very much about it. I was really out of sorts. It wasn’t a bad experience, and it did help. I mostly needed to just recover from a nervous breakdown and burnout. Here are the things I do remember: 

1. The nurses were kind. The doctors were kind. I never felt mistreated or judged. I never saw anyone else being mistreated. The staff was very compassionate. If I had a headache or an upset stomach, I could talk to the nurse and they would give me something for it. One night I had a nightmare and woke screaming, and a nurse sat in the room with me until I fell back asleep.

2. I went to the groups and classes, and participated. I liked the art and music ones a lot. One day a lady came with some small animals and we could interact with them. I held a bunny and cried. I don’t know why I cried. 

3. I made friends with two young women my age. We were not supposed to touch each other, but I got permission one day to get a brush and comb and help one of these women brush out her long, matted hair. It took a few hours, but after I got it brushed out and she washed it, I put it in two Dutch braids for her.  I redid her hair every day for her after that. When she was discharged before me, she gave me a hug and thanked me for saving her hair. 

4. I was allowed to have books, and I was able to read in my room (I had my own small room; but some people did share), and in the small atrium by myself after a few days. I’m sure someone had eyes on me, but I wasn’t troublesome. 

A few things I didn’t really like: 
1. You get watched a lot. They check on you in the night. They check on you when you shower. (They didn’t go in, but the door didn’t go up to the top, and they’d ask you questions through the gap.

2. I did not enjoy the food. For the first few days, I would only pick at my food, and so I got assigned a « meal buddy », which was a nurse who sat and watched me eat. I finally got up the courage to tell her that I didn’t like what I was eating, and she asked what I wanted. I asked for a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup and a cup of yogurt. This was given to me and I ate it, and I didn’t have a meal buddy anymore. If I didn’t want what was on offer that day, I would ask for that. 

3. Some of the other patients were INTENSE. I was in a coed ward, and there were two men I remember who stood out- one was a man who talked very fast about some strange conspiracy theories, and got in your face if you disagree with him. The other was an older gentleman who was forever tryin to disrobe, which was problematic for obvious reasons. There was often screaming and crying, but if it got too intense, you could ask for ear plugs. 

4. If people from outside brought you things, like snacks or drinks, or things to do, you didn’t get to keep them. My siblings brought me some sodas and chocolate and a bag of pretzels and I had to ask for them from the nurse. They always gave me what I asked for, but I didn’t like care for having to ask. 

Go, and take advantage of what they have to offer. It generally helps. Good luck.",3

I’m not trying to undermine your trepidation. Going inpatient to ANYWHERE unbeknownst is nerve wracking. Also, for sure, it is a disruption.  I am simply pointing out that if it is something that you truly feel you need, try and be grateful you have options. Many of us do not.",1

I think you’re in good hands here. You will get more freedom than inpatient and having your own room is very nice. I think the structure will really help you.

Try to pay attention to them because you will probably end up feeling better but you can take the skills you learn when you leave.

I have always liked the nurses and doctors there and I have talked to them as much as possible and I recommend it to you too. Try to be as open as possible. I have never liked talking to the other patients as I have prioritised my own feelings and haven't had the energy to socialise either. I liked the food! But this obviously depends a lot on where you're staying. I wish you the best, make the most of your time there.",1

How many centimeters are we talking about? 5 centimeters, 7? Because if you have 10 or 11 centimeters, it's not the end of the world, seriously.

Because yes, it would be a small penis, but believe it or not, women prefer it that way for a very simple reason: They are small, and anything above that hurts them.

I myself have a friend with benefits, she is 155cm, less than 50kg, in other words, she is very small, she is what we call ""mignon"". I'm not even endowed, 15cm here, and it's already enough to hurt her by hitting the ceiling lol

mentalhealth,1mqld5t,n8t7bke,i picked up smoking weed again after years in april/may this year. it was so much fun. until one day i smoked after resigning from my job. i had such a bad panic attack that i had to knock on my neighbor's door (whom i dont know) and ask for help. they called the ambulance and gave injected me meperidine after which i slowly started calming down.

For years before that I'd notice the differences every time I'd start smoking and then stop. This time, I've noticed how addictive my behavior is. When I'd smoke weed last month, I got really depressed while smoking.

For my mental health, even nicotine is such a shitty thing. If I even take one puff from my vape, it doesn't make me feel good just depressed. 

I'm waiting for this vape to run out so I can finally stop smoking because it ruins my appetite, my sleep, and my mental health because instead of listening to my body I'm ignoring it. My stomache is the size of my fist right now and I can only eat small portions at a time.

I'm pretty lucky that I didn't smoke during the two years I did emdr therapy and spravato treatments. It's kind of a great thing this time, because I'm not attracted to the substances the same way as before. My relationship with weed and vaping has changed.

mentalhealth,1mocu8f,n8baw8s,"I was about to put up a general post, but I'll do a practice run with you...

So. What happens is...you're a kid and your emotions never get validated. In fact, you probably found it dangerous to express your emotions at home. You took that to heart. Then you go out to school, probably middle school and high-school, and everyone invalidates you there. You take it all personally. And all that invalidation causes you to end up with a personality disorder. 

Borderline personality disorder is a common one. Narcissistic personality disorder is a common one. There are others, like Schizoid personality disorder, where you go and live in your own imagination to escape the world and have validation from imaginary people. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is like a lite version of real OCD and being a real dick to the people you manage at work.

They're all manifestations of the same thing: invalidation. Chronic invalidation.

What's a personality disorder? It's when your ego gets so crushed by chronically being dismissed, ignored or dangerous to express. It's a frail thing that takes ANY threat to it seriously, and kicks in your fight or flight response. Your brain sees it as a real life-threatening thing and makes you explode or retreat with yourself to deal with it. Mama bear or scaredy cat, depending on your disposition and what has and hasn't worked in the past.

If you go look them up, I expect you will find that you show a number of signs of one or more of them. 

Do pardon my tone. I have a headache, and I hate repeating myself. Hence why I really need to put up a post about this. Seeing how common this thing that happened to me is on this subreddit is getting to me. I'm really starting to get pissed off with the world. That's the rage one of my PD's puts me in when I see the kinds of injustices I put up with growing up.

I seem to have gotten stuck in both my procrastination, my fear, my resignation to life, and for years I have just gone day-by-day and stayed in the same place in every way.  I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression and Anxiety, and went on disability for it. I was pretty-much bedridden and didn't eat, lived my days waking up, going and watching TV, then going to bed and repeating that cycle. I suffered from bulimia and anorexia as a teen, and was in that cycle again.  I secretly hoped it would take me out, and then I could not take responsibility for my death as I refused to do for my life. My parents made me go be evaluated by a local psychiatric org, and they then put in process this disability status. I had a case worker and a psychiatrist. So that was my new normal:   It felt safe, rountinely comfortable, and I place i settled into. I have a degree of agoraphobia, social anxiety, so that lifestyle was served by being told I was not well enough to participate in the real world, if that makes sense. And it provides me enought money to get by on. I tried to get a job recently, and didn't disclose my illness or why I had been unemployed for two decades. And my affect, my presentation is nervous, and I am unable to fake a smile, so I must have come off as cold, indifferent, even hostile, not exactly who a major home/hardware chain wants dealing with customers.

I think it’s important to know that everyone has their own struggles in life. To someone else, on paper you might have had everything, but you know you struggle with mental illness. This can be debilitating, don’t feel bad about yourself. No one is ever perfect, and you should give others grace in that regard too. Good things always come with bad, and we don’t get to pick what we start out with in this life.

That being said..
Totally agree, I have been thinking about this lately. I’m 26 too and in the same situation. I have just started getting a hold on my depression that I’ve had for I believe over a decade. 

I was given so many good cards in life and feel like I’ve wasted my younger years/my potential. I did graduate college (that my family paid for), but if it wasn’t for my mental illness/not getting help for it sooner, I could have done so much better in school and not graduated with a below average GPA and no experience. I also don’t have many friends now at this age, where a lot of people have friend groups that they’ve built over their college years. I never got much experience being social, despite having all the opportunities in the world if I just got out and tried.

It’s also a good thing that you are realizing this now. Yeah, it would have been nicer to realize it a couple years ago for sure, but we can’t turn back time and there are people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and up that are still “wasting” their life being unhappy.",1

Truth be told, there's plenty of other misunderstood kids. The best way to find them is to unapologetically be yourself. Work on little projects and share them with people, maybe someone else your age will be inspired and say hello

Even if your therapist doesn't belong to that group, there's clearly a similar mindset. It's insidious to take advantage of the trust a patient gives to a therapist to work in their own motives.

mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islkfkc,Your therapist is a crank and needs to have his license removed,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isllcno,"Um. No. That's not okay. Therapists are supposed to be impartial and shouldn't be forcing their views upon you. I would say that it's time to seek a new therapist who understands you better. This one just doesn't sound like a good fit for you.

I wish you all the best in finding a better therapist.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islo98g,I see a NON-religious therapist. He’s “spiritual” my ass. He’s also going against rules of ethics by saying these things to you. I honestly would report him if I were you. This is wrong.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islq5vf,"No professional should say these things, it is a conflict of interest. Are you seeing someone through the church by chance? I personally would roll my eyes and ask if they plan on exorcising me or baptist me. I find Uber religious help to be incredibly toxic and not based in science, wich is what you need when your health is on the line. Find someone else.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islu302,"As a kinda ""religious"" person. That sounds off to me to say that. I see a therapist and she only speaks about religious stuff if I bring it up. But she never initiates it or brings it into therapy. Run... find a new one, cause that's a no",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islyz4o,"I honestly think this is highly inappropriate and should be reported, its medical coercion.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islzr1p,"Um hell no. Run. Now. Find someone who doesn’t judge you, but rather validates what you have to say and how you feel. Good luck-",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism3vvh,Hard no.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism57u1,Hell no,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism5ymm,That therapist is ass. Go to another one,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism75ub,"No, I don't believe in god and even those who do have no right saying that's the cause. I would get a new therapist asap.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism7wuu,I’m not religious and I have a Christian therapist. So I can 100% confirm this is not normal.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism9fce,"Hey, this is a clear cut case of spiritual abuse and a religious leader shouldn’t be saying these things to you let alone a therapist. For your own continued wellbeing - please stop seeing this person.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ismc3cn,This therapist is going against their ethical code and will be reprimanded by their licensure board if reported for this behavior,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isme8my,Run.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ismiwm9,"Absolutely not normal. Any therapist trying that hard to push religion on you is more concerned with that than actually helping you.

I can guarantee you as someone who’s made tremendous progress in the realm of anxiety and depression—religion is not a requirement. I’m agnostic, and I honestly don’t think about god all that often. But I’m doing better than I was two years ago.

Find a new therapist, if you can. And if you can’t, I’d honestly recommend just going without until you can. This guy’s doing more harm than good.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ismjudq,Not normal sounds like he’s in a cult or something,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ismk35j,"That’s not normal at all, they should be helping you discover what’s causing your anxiety/depression rather then making it about religion. That seems extremely inappropriate and dismissive to me. If possible it might be a good idea to switch therapists or at least bring up that this is a concern in an upcoming session. I hope you find someone who is able to help and support you better :)",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ismqdax,absolutely not. that’s just wrong,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isn3jk8,I know you mentioned it may be hard to find a therapist who isn't actively religious. If you find it necessary to stop seeing this one right away then depending on your issues/diagnosis I would recommend looking into therapy work sheets or self help books in the interim. They can't provide everything a therapist can but depending on the severity of your mental health they could help if you feel like it will be better to end sessions immediately.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isnazjm,"Well, statistically...it is true that depression is more prevalent among atheists/agnostics than believers. But it's definitely not a cause of depression and anxiety. 
Your therapist really shouldn't be shoving his religious views down your throat. that's unacceptable.
I once tried religion. Didn't work out that well for me. It's almost like a cult. You identity is reduced to that of the community and any individuality is crushed. The thing about religion is they can't stand any criticism. No scrutiny. And I don't like that. I Can't just accept what I'm told and never question anything.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isnjeoo,"Faith shouldn’t play a part in therapy. I will say my faith has helped me tremendously with my anxiety and depression, but that was a personal choice for me. Everyone has their own journey. For me, I am not willing to take meds and I’ve also gained some tools as a mindset development coach along the way. I use the tools and I also have great people around me. I know what I need to do first thing in the morning to set myself up for not being as reactive throughout the day. Main point is this: your therapists shouldn’t be telling you what to believe in. That’s your choice. Having a spiritual belief is important, but your beliefs are your beliefs. There’s a good book by Dr. Joe Dispenza, called “Breaking the habit of being yourself” that I highly recommend. It talks more about quantum physics as well as implements faith practices and explains how they go hand and hand. Faith doesn’t just mean God. It means you believe in something bigger than yourself. I can say from personal experience that believing in something bigger than myself and holding myself to a higher standard (sometimes too high, which I’m still working on that too) is why I’m still here on this earth. 

I will say this from personal experience - not every mentor, therapist, or coach is for you. Find one who is. 

I hope you get some peace and can find joy from within. It’s important 😊",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,iss3ppo,"The comments he makes are religious and not spiritual. Needing the love of the Creator or having a Creator is not necessary for spirituality, but for religion (regardless of religion). An individual may find spirituality in religion, others find it in nature, and some may not find it at all. The challenge is to question this concept with your therapist, which sounds quite fundamentalist. If you can challenge it or find a new therapist it seems difficult. Hopefully you are not in an area that is fundamental and not subject to Sharia law.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isit6r7,He claims that he's spiritual not religious per say . He told that nothing could fill the void inside me but the love of the creator and that i should talk to him .idk sounds a bit weird to me,58

mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isndltb,[deleted],1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjhsvv,I thaught so. At first i thaught that its not that deep but when it became the center of our sessions I felt something was off,2
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isiy7r2,Oh no its a catholic region lmao .And i just remembered he sited few bible verses during our last session,8
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isji4el,The day i told him i was a non believer he kinda insisted that my problem was spiritual .but he stated that spirituality is a big part of psychology that's why he was tellimg me so,2
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjge0b,Yeah but i read online that spiritual wellbeing is a huge part of mental wellbeing idk how to feel about him anymore,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjh819,So brierley he said as long as i don't have a relationship with God I'll always be stuck and unhappy in my life as he is the creator and the only one that can change my life .He also sent me some testimonials of people that changed their life through christ .As for my father i don't have a bad bad relationship with him but it's a bit complicated so basically he's blamimg my lack of faith in god on my relationship with my dad,2
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjkplx,He once told me that maybe God put him in my way as a sign to reconnect with him,2
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,iso0gjj,Im not from the states! Appreciate the advice thaught!,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isitjj1,Yeah....I would really stop seeing this person. I would highly recommend that you go see a different therapist. This is why they tell you to shop around for different therapist. Because not every single one will be a good fit for you.,105
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjosar,That’s religious.,3
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,ism4394,Report them to the local authorities that license therapists. I get on fine with my dad and I think religion is bullshit. So is your therapist.,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,iwhbnp0,My mom says she’s spiritual but I swear it changes every day depending on the situation. She uses religion as a scapegoat when she thinks up conspiracy theories.,1

mentalhealth,y5ad6r,islz8v5,Please don’t listen to this shit. Your religion (or non religion) is completely irrelevant to your mental health. Having a therapist (or redditors) push their agenda on your is disgusting. Please find a new therapist or it will only lead to additional mental health problems. Good luck!,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isjw3fk,"May I ask another pointed question: do you ever feel this therapist has tried to seduce you? How did you find them? Did they disclose they are a religiously based therapist and did you know that in the beginning ie was that a selling point for you? (I think not, just checking though.) and what is this therapist’s level of education and training? I’m asking because therapy binds the patient to the therapist emotionally and then guides them to better choices and relationships via that bond and I have benefitted from MSCSW help. Would you feel safe, or not safe, brining this concern to them in therapy? These questions for me would help guide my decision about whether they are right for me, and I hope to be useful to you in your journey so you feel safe.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isiu3oq,The problem is that i live in a pretty religious area so i don't think finding a therapist that is not religious will be easy...,16
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isnyoo4,Lol i don't think i can report such thing in my country,1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isizu9r,I really feel i need to find myself first in order to decide if im religious/ spiritual. I live in a maronite catholic area that is not strict and pretty open but still religious ( think of southern italy for example we re pretty similar!),3
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isnzzgb,No he would usually mention that he is not a religious counselor but has guided several people with such cases .but i dont think he's a fraud because he's a college professor and is a counselor at very known school in town ( its a catholic school how surprising ik),2

mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isj3tc1,"I would totally agree with you. I used to be Christian and quite devout. I am actually the complete opposite now. I was told that I need spirituality in my life in order to be cured. My first question is why?? Spirituality is not necessarily religious but can be. Spirituality is not going to help scientists in lab coats find cures. If someone wants to embrace a spiritual path to recovery, even if I don’t agree, I will support them in their choice. I don’t have to agree with someone to support them.",4
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,iso2g7t,"Thank you. In a way to me it would be a red flag because he publicly identifies one way but in practice does another. If he poses himself as the intermediary between your parents and God and attempts any seductive behavior (which I will admit, from your anecdote, I consider already having happened), you can change your mind at any time even mid-therapy session. But that may not be the most important in the balance of things. The main thing is for you to feel safe and supported and growing in therapy with your therapist.",1
mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isiuq90,Oh so the bigger problem is that im not from the states . I guess finding a less religious therapist is a national struggle ( im from the middle east if that makes more sense),18

mentalhealth,y5ad6r,isl6v5v,"Be very careful with this! A licensed clinician cannot practice outside of their country. BUT because other countries do not necessarily have mental health laws, that’s the loophole. ALSO a lot of people will market themselves as therapists without proper licensure, this can lead to improper treatment and increase in symptoms. Not saying they are all bad and will cause more emotional damage, but there is a chance.

mentalhealth,1bwqfke,ky8s7ky,"*Alcohol Use Disorder* can negatively affect mental health. If you have anyone in your family with substance problems, you are at risk for this disorder which means drinking even one drink could lead to alcoholism. AUD worsens depression and anxiety. If you are on SSRI or other psychiatric drugs, it could cause your medication to stop working.

I do think alcohol has its place in society and can be a welcomed treat sometimes. It can make you more relaxed about social situations, it can lead to some fun nights out with friends. It can lighten the mood at family gatherings. But it can also make all of these things 100x worse if abused. 

My advice is find out if you are predisposed genetically to AUD and talk to your psychiatrist before experimenting with alcohol. If your Dr. says it’s probably fine one time then hey, try it! Just have a plan for cessation such as “I’ll drink on my birthday and not again for __ weeks”.",9
mentalhealth,1bwqfke,ky8z4jo,Yes!!!! Recovering ❤️‍🩹 alcoholic here,7
mentalhealth,1bwqfke,ky8ps5t,"Usually, yes. 

You’ll often feel better and relaxed during consumption and then worse the next day.",12
mentalhealth,1bwqfke,ky9bd70,"Realistically if you drink in moderation, that is to say if you stick to enough that gives you a sense of ease without pushing it further; you won't have much of the nasty side effects that others try to scare you into. 

People who overdid it or don't know how to limit or have any discipline over the amount of drugs they consume often exaggerate because they experienced the more severe effects of what they took, rather than being smart and consuming them in a more mature manner. 

Depending on your weight and height, you can get away with having 2 shots worth and feel relatively good and wake up feeling as though nothing happened, especially as a light weight. If you push it past 4 shots, as an example, you'll generally feel very loopy and uncoordinated. This will later result in you potentially having a hangover, if at all, due to the fact that your body takes longer to process the alcohol by the amount you take in. I can't remember the exact amount of time, but it's a slow process, so in general you want to take it slow and limit yourself. 

Please note that why I'm suggesting this is because realistically no one can stop you from experimenting. The people telling you its bad or that you shouldn't just want to attempt to look after you like a helicopter parent, thinking that they're doing some kind of good. But ultimately its up to you. My best advice is that if you are going to try alcohol no matter what any one says; stick to a small amount first, because if you're prone to addiction this might not be the best decision for you. The feeling can be very addicting

Edit: I also say this as a 29 year old who is currently tipsy and have been struggling with alcoholism since I was 20 years old.",3
mentalhealth,1bwqfke,ky9m6hr,"Alcohol is very nasty. Luckily it’s an acquired taste so if you stay away from it and almost never have it - it will always feel foreign and yuck. That’s the best place to be with alcohol.

In terms of drinking, it doesn’t do any ‘one’ thing, of you measure anxiety in ‘units’ and then depression in ‘units’. Basically for every ‘unit’ of anxiety alcohol may remove (which doesn’t always work) the next day as it wears off you repay the debt about 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. That is to say you’ll get 10 units of anxiety for every 1 unit that was removed from drinking the alcohol the night before.

With depression it’s similar too, however unlike anxiety it doesn’t happen straight away. After you drink, it spreads out the depression over a longer time span over weeks and it’s very subtle. So if you drink every weekend you’re just kind of perpetually 10% to 20% more depressed than you would be without it. But I won’t say I understand all of the neurochemistry around that one.

So yeah good question - alcohol is a poison and there’s no shortcut to handle mental health with it. I would make a note to just say if alcohol does make you feel ‘better’ that is exceptionally dangerous as can create addiction and you know the rest there… the more you have it the more you need to ‘feel better’ so you can go downhill very badly.

I guess I would just say be careful around it. Almost all problems police have to deal with are from this legal drug - it is very very dangerous.

I went into a lot of debt and wasted too much time trying to people-please and pretend to be someone I wasn’t; this was extremely mentally damaging and I am still in recovery, 4 years later. Alcohol is so widely accepted in society, I imagine because the majority of society cannot admit to our really big problems and would rather suppress them in the name of “fun” - this is also why many people struggle with therapy, because the truth can be difficult to face, it’s a lot easier to squish yourself into a box of lies!",2

mentalhealth,1bwqfke,kybj1vj,"Like everyone else has said, best not to start.  

In simplistic terms, alcohol is poison, and it's best to avoid it. A [hangover](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hangovers/symptoms-causes/syc-20373012) is just a step below alcohol poisoning, and will make you feel like garbage.  Under the influence you can do stupid things -- especially when mixed with peer pressure -- that can ruin your life and the lives of others.

Yes, people drink, and a glass of wine or beer won't hurt the majority of people, but binge drinking -- what I experienced in my college years -- is too much of a ""good"" thing. 

If you must, start small -  keep it to one or two drinks tops.  And a drink is one beer, or one glass of wine, or one shot (40% / 80 proof), -- a mixed drink can have multiple shots.

Be smart and use moderation or just say no.",1
mentalhealth,1bwqfke,kycchna,"Almost always.

We learn over time to suppress or in some other way use anxiety to suppress a lot of our symptoms. That is why a lot of us are so mentally drained at the end of the day.

Alcohol removes inhibitions. That removes that suppression, so the depression becomes deeper, the PTSD triggers become stronger, the dissociation becomes more impactful, and our emotional regulation stops. We are easier to get pissed off or suicidally depressed....More than 1/4 of suicides which are completed are done so under the influence of alcohol.

However, just to be complete, in limited quantities, alcohol has a similar effect to benzodiazepines like klonopin in reducing anxiety in anxiety disorders.. It reduces anxiety, in many who have anxiety disorders or PTSD. However, this is the same reason that people with PTSD or severe anxiety are more likely than most to become severe alcoholics and die of cirrhosis of the liver or other liver related illnesses.

This is because alcohol is literally a poison. A teratogen, meaning that it kills cells. This is the reason that Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder exists. It kills the cells that are responsible for the formation of the embryo and fetal development. THis includes the formation of very important parts of the brain, particulary those involving the brain and facial structures. People with FASD tend to have either facial deformations or a very similar facial morphology and the structures of the brain resposible for self-regulation and behavioral control are not able to form correctly, which can cause issues like severe intellectual disorders or impulse control disorders. 

On the other hand, for some people, alcohol increases anxiety because it removes the defenses, we have built up against it.

In my personal experience, I did things under the influence of alcohol that put me at risk. I drove a lot. That could have caused accidents and I could have hurt or killed someone else or myself. I could also have gotten arrested and screwed up my life. The only reason I did it was that the alcohol allowed me to convince myself that I was a better driver when I was drunk than when I was sober because my father was.

I also remember standing outside of the house of a guy I was hooking up with regularly and shouting ""I am tired of being your dirty little secret!"" The shame of that moment still causes me to cringe to this day, 30 years later.",1

mentalhealth,1bwqfke,kya0034,"I really don’t think this is true. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that feeling “fine” the next day, meaning not hungover, isn’t the whole story. My emotional regulation and patience can be lessened, and while I may not feel bad physically I don’t really feel good either. I’m 32 and used to work in the alcohol industry. I’ve since cut way back - I didn’t quit drinking but I usually choose a non alcoholic option when going out. If I do drink, it’s 1-2 drinks only and I do it once a week or less. I do notice a difference if I have 2 drinks 2-3 times in one week. By the end of the week I feel worse even if I never really feel “hungover.” I didn’t feel this way at 21 and I do think turning 30 seems to have marked the beginning of a reduction in my body’s ability to metabolize alcohol. All this is just to say that there’s a difference between not feeling obviously terrible and knowing that you’re not feeling your best. Moderate alcohol consumption has moderately negative effects, which isn’t shocking. I’m not gonna deny that being drunk is fun, but at the very least it must be treated as pure entertainment with no other function. It’s like gambling. If you gamble because you think you’ll really hit it big, you’ll lose everything. If you gamble in moderation and only bet what you can afford to lose, you won’t ruin yourself and you might have fun.

Keep the door open to him is a good thing to do. If he wants to talk to you about it, make sure the door is open for him. You want him to have space to just to get it out his system.

mentalhealth,1md96hu,n5zs1ip,"I've had let's say 90% negative experiences with therapists/psychiatrists across the board. My general rule is to stick with someone on the basis of whether they're helping me, not on anything else I don't have a metric on, like their experiences. 

Having very recent school experiences and the experience of being an addict might actually mean they have a lot of feedback to offer, and newer information from schooling. If it were me looking at someone much younger (which I've had before) I would have a few sessions with them and really lay hard on my needs, be entirely honest about what I want from therapy, and if after all that I don't feel they've lived up, move on, same as I would for any therapist. 

The top thing is, you need to feel you can talk to them, and if their experience level doesn't make you feel that way, maybe tell them? Or just move on, you have that right.",3
mentalhealth,1md96hu,n60a0rf,"As a younger therapist, I understand your concern. It was very useful to me when my client would be straightforward and comment ""you are so young, I'm twice your age"". They are challenged with the thought if I would even understand them. In some ways their concerns make sense, I really don't have the grasp of life as someone who is 50. 

On the other side, we are trained to attempt to understand experiences that we don't have and if you sensed curiosity and no judgement, maybe that is a good start. But you should know that changing therapists is more than OK if you don't feel the ""click"", and is encouraged by a conscious therapist. I offer to help search for a new one, if a person feels like I'm not the right fit. 

On a personal note, I admire recovering addicts and I think it takes a massive amount of maturity and looking right into the void, to recover from an addiction. When I was searching for a therapist for myself, I felt like I was seen more by someone who struggled with the same, and survived and prospered. I also understand if someone feels differently about that.",3
mentalhealth,1md96hu,n602b3w,"The age is not an issue, but the experience may be. Some clients need a higher level of care than some therapists can offer, especially if they haven’t got really much experience under their belt. However, he could still turn out awesome. Some people are just meant to be therapists. I currently see an intern, so he hasn’t even finished schooling yet, and he is absolutely incredible. Because of that, I’d say stick around a little bit longer. Give it a couple more sessions and if you still feel it isn’t a fit, call it quits. 

As far as his past goes, I don’t know if it’s something I would want my therapist to reveal to me but hey to each their own. I don’t care what their past is so long as they are present in session. I’ve had therapists with bipolar, autism, adhd, ex-alcoholics. None of those things affected their ability to perform therapy noticeably. Some of them weren’t fits for other reasons, but it had nothing to do with their past or their diagnoses. 

All that being said, you have to be comfortable in therapy to make any progress. If you aren’t comfortable and can’t put this aside to give him a fair shot, then it’s honestly best to just separate now and find a different therapist that you might fit better with.",2

We have to start somewhere. We all need someone to take a chance on us. But on the flipside, I would get someone much older than me not being comfortable with me as a therapist. It's hard to argue that there is an alternative to simply living.

I'm still unsure about this situation. I'd like to believe that I'm the kind of person who would say, ""To hell with their age. It's just a number. They can still help me,"" but it's different when it's your mental health you're talking about. I don't know. Perhaps I can go on one more visit.

I also understand that leaving is difficult due to the potential of big gaps between jobs and the financial strain that can create.

It sounds like some extra sick leave in your case would be good. Your health and wellbeing is always more important than any job, and there is no point chugging along in both mental and physical pain only to have yourself continue to decline: not good for you, not good for your job.

Perhaps taking some sick leave and using that to look at other jobs may be worthwhile? I know you said it can take time in your field but perhaps that would make a good start, with a new role potentially bringing less stress. I would also advise, if you haven't already, speaking to your doctor regarding your mental health symptoms and seeing what they may recommend. Medication isn't a silver bullet, but it can really help and, coupled with therapy if that's possible for you, can make a world of difference.

Subsidies: The ACA marketplace, accessible through HealthCare.gov, offers premium tax credits (subsidies) based on income and household size, which can significantly reduce monthly premiums.
Affordability: In 2025, many people qualified for plans at $10 or less per month after subsidies, thanks to recent legislation.
Plan Categories: Marketplace plans are available in metal tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Catastrophic), which indicate the plan's share of costs.
Bronze: Lower monthly premiums, higher deductibles (good if you rarely need care).
Silver: Moderate premiums and deductibles (good for those with average healthcare needs, also may offer cost-sharing reductions).
Gold and Platinum: Higher premiums, lower deductibles (better for individuals or families with ongoing healthcare needs). 
2. Explore Other Low-Cost Options:
Medicaid: If you have a low income, you might be eligible for Medicaid, which provides free or low-cost comprehensive coverage.
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP):For families who don't qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance, CHIP provides coverage for children.
High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs): These plans have lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. They can be a good option if you are generally healthy and want coverage for major medical expenses.
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): HDHPs can be paired with HSAs, allowing you to save tax-free money for medical expenses.
Staying on a Parent's Plan: If you're under 26, you may be eligible to remain on a parent's health insurance plan, which can be a cost-effective option.
Medicare with Extra Help: If you have Medicare and a limited income, you may qualify for ""Extra Help"" to cover prescription drug costs.
Medicare Special Needs Plans: These Medicare Advantage plans are for individuals with specific health conditions or who require a high level of care. 
3. Tips for Finding Affordable Coverage:
Compare Plans: Don't just look at premiums. Consider deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums to estimate total yearly costs.
Check Provider Networks: Ensure your preferred doctors and hospitals are included in the plan's network to avoid higher out-of-network costs.
Review Prescription Drug Coverage: Make sure the plan covers your medications and consider potential copays.
Seek Assistance: Navigators or trained professionals can help you compare plans and understand your options, including applying for financial assistance. You can find local help through HealthCare.gov.
Review Annually: Reassess your healthcare needs and coverage during open enrollment each year, as needs and plan options can change. 
Remember:
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide coverage for those with low incomes.
ACA plans offer potential premium subsidies, which are income-based tax credits.
Bronze plans generally have the lowest premiums but highest deductibles.
Sentara Health Plans offers some of the cheapest plans in Virginia.
Aetna Health Inc. offers the most affordable Silver tier plan in Virginia.
Innovation Health Plan, Inc. offers the cheapest Bronze and Gold plans in Virginia. 
By carefully considering your needs and comparing the available options, you can find a health insurance plan that provides good coverage at an affordable price


I hope you figure out your job situation and whatnot ",1

Anything to do with breathing stresses me out anything slow like yoga stresses me out things like skincare or tidying I’m not into n feel to overwhelming the noticing things doesn’t work for me either journaling I don’t understand. I went thru yrs of ppl telling me stuff that never helped like STOP n then I looked into DBT n found TIPP which the ice dive n intense excersize helps n being outside helps me aswell. I’m with u on the sun is stressful I swear my anxiety goes up in the summer holding ice helps aswell. I’m with u on therapy n meds aswell but meds don’t do tons for me. Following what other ppl have said have definitely made things worse for me aswell partly cos I’m autistic n they say things directed at neurotypicals I think,1

Also for a few days after my mom disapproving of me wanting to go to college, I remember just lying in my bed for at least a week and just crying myself to sleep (obviously with the exception of going to the bathroom) and I was just filled with a bunch of rage along with the urge for my body to just give out or to go to sleep and never wake up, but everytime I bring up just how much it hurts to her, she just says I'm being overdramatic or she just gets insanely defensive and I think it's gotten to the point where I've been bottling up my feelings for a year now but even when talking with my therapist, I just CAN'T get what I'm feeling to come out. Since that event, I can't cry, I don't have the energy to be angry either (or not angry like I was before, just agitated as per usual), and overall I just can't feel much of anything I keep looking inside and I just don't know what to do anymore
Nothing is making me happy anymore and the every dream I have feels out of reach and I can't even imagine myself in a successful position
I truly think I'm gonna die in this place :/",1

I have become content in my misery.

mentalhealth,nraor5,h0gauob,"It’s been steadily declining since I was 4 years old. That’s also right around the time my abuse started and when trauma began to set in.

All of these issues have impacted my life negatively. I had to drop out of high school because my depression became so debilitating (and was suicidal). I was fortunate enough to be able to obtain my GED but could not complete College due to my mental illnesses. 

I’ve been through periods where I’m able to work ok followed by catastrophic crash and burns. With hospitalizations punctuating chapters of my life.

I went to therapy for 8 months and my therapist is moving away so I’m thinking whether I should stop therapy altogether or seek another therapist. Overall, I still struggle with depression, anxiety, sleeping problems, severe procrastination, handling relationships with underlying trauma. I turn 20 this year but I don’t feel any better. Oh yeah, I’m also Asian so I went to the psychiatrist myself to get diagnosed at 16 because my mother said I was just sad and that I should get over it.

mentalhealth,nraor5,h0giicb,"I was about 4 when extreme ADHD kicked in, I became violent and couldn't concentrate on anything. The school begged my parents to put me on meds. And they did. It helped but also made me feel horrible, so they took me off and for the next 12 or so years my grades severely suffered, but I was much calmer than when I was young. I was out back onto meds and my grades rocketed up, but I started abusing the medication and was taken off shortly after. 8 or so years later here I am, still struggling severely with ADHD to the point it makes me mad at myself. I can be looking at someone talking, hearing the words, but for some reason they just come out in my mind as individual words not connected like in a sentence and I feel embarrassed or rude because I have to ask them to repeat what they just said. With this came extreme social anxiety that I have ""lived"" with my entire life. An extremely low tolerance for stress, and a school therapist had said I have developed a ""distorted idea of relationships"" I guess my intimate relationship views are not normal, but they seem totally fine to me, aside from when I was dating, every relationship was either serious or a fling and I had jealousy and self esteem issues. Haven't had a relationship or a friend in probably 5 years now and have no desire for one either, which I know is not health but I'm not sure why not. As I think back I realize none of this is new to me, it has just gotten more prevalent from age 4 to now 25. The things that have changed are that between middle school and highschool I went from getting bullied to being too scary for anyone to want to bully me. Younger me held my head down and took it, older me would become extremely aggressive, almost animal like when I felt I was being pushed around. Even had a teacher tell me some time after graduation that I seemed like the kind of kid who would do something extreme like bring a gun or something. Of course, she didn't really see my thoughts, if she did shed know I would never have that kind of mindset, I had an extremely strong sense of right and wrong that still rules me today. One therapist I went to said I have the typical depression anxiety blablabla like it seems every American has now, but I don't thing the guy understood, or even listened to me. He said I was right handed in my paperwork, but I'm not. I'm mixed handed, which is like ambidextrous but shitty and annoying because I have to learn what hand is good for what as I go. Left for writing, right for throwing, left for shooting, right for hitting, even my eye dominance is different depending on what I do. There must be some pretty messed up wiring up there for that to happen, huh? I just hope that one day I can figure out what is truly ""wrong"" with me and address it fully, not just the ADHD and depression and anxiety, but the skewed sense of relationships, the need for loneliness I crave like a drug, the constant state of alert and problem solving as if life depended on it. I have PTSD and sometimes it makes me feel like Im in fight or flight, but it is ALWAYS fight. Always watching, listening, worrying and waiting for harm to come. Always prepared, armed, thinking through scenarios that could happen. What if my door gets kicked in right this moment? Weapons ready, kick table into door, listen for the sound of a gun or other weapons, prepare to fight. multiple guns and knives within reach at all times, know their conditions and operations, how to fix a jam, go through the motions in my head, roll tap rack, when and if I should shoot, what if they hit me first? how would I care for a wound if I was hurt? Go through the motions in my head again and again, look around for something to plug a hole or put pressure on a cut, it's as if I'm always waiting for an attack. maybe it's paranoia or PTSD or both.  But this is CONSTANT, you would think I was at war in my mind all the time. Hell, maybe I am. I know I'm not dangerous to anyone because I have had company, had people trespass, had crack heads come here. Etc... And I never even thought 9f hurting someone. But I'm constantly at yellow alert and ready for it to come, ready for the other to do something weird, hands in pockets? Strange shape in pocket. Could it be a gun? Wallet? How much does it look like it weighs? If it was. And if they pulled it on me, what's my move? Grab gun arm, punch throat, if that fails kick groin, go for eyes, disarm violently, group mag and shoot what's in the chamber so gun is out of battery, all of this spinning in my head while I'm having a friendly conversation about the deer out here with the person I'm also thinking of. All of it going through my mind in just seconds, like I expect everyone I see to try to kill me because you never know who's crazy and who's normal. Again, I'm not violent myself, but always prepared to respond to violence as if it's always just one second away from happening ALL. THE. TIME. Mix this with ADHD and it's a whirlwind of going through the worst scenarios I can in my mind and trying to prepare for them, work through them and it's so stressful to see these images and scenarios in your mind that it's exhausting. Just like a veteran with PTSD, but I've never experienced violence more than a shove or a angry teenager throwing a knife at me. I make myself dangerous to be safe. And I keep a cool head like no other I can think of, but my mind is a fight all the time like I'm at war with myself, to keep myself sharp and ready for the ""what if"".",2

Used to get immense guilt whenever I saw my victims in school. But felt happy whenever I saw them being happy with others. Changed my school to let go of it. Changed a lot since then.

mentalhealth,nraor5,h0i1vda,I definitely recommend using guided meditations like those from apps. It makes it a lot easier to not have to “think” about it,2
mentalhealth,nraor5,h0i4q6c,"(Sorry, in Australia so I was sleeping). You're right, best not to criticise ourselves. I just did very basic meditation. I had some exposure to Tibetan Buddhism but it's basically all the same. You sit cross legged or in a chair and place a candle, picture or object that has positive associations for you: could be a statue of Buddha, a flower, a photo of a nice place, anything that is calming.

Then you just sit and focus lightly on your breathing and feel what's going on in your body. At first you will notice your mind becoming very active and lots of thoughts coming but actually you are just becoming more aware of it. This is normal and a good sign. The key is not to worry about the fact you have thoughts, not to hold onto them, try to imagine them as leaves floating down a stream. They come and they go. They're not you. 

Underneath it all you are perfect and calm. The mental cloud is just that; a cloud. You are the sun. That's your true nature. The clouds obscure it but never actually touch it. There is no wrong way to do it. Distractions will come. Don't get uptight, or tell yourself ""stop thinking!"" The point is to watch your breath, watch your thoughts, feel what it's like to be fully present in your body. 

You can play soothing music or repeat a mantra if you like, a little song or prayer, ""may I be happy, may I well"", ""I am love, I am loved, I am worthy"", or just ""Ohm"" if it helps. The vibration of your voice can be a calming thing to focus on. Most importantly try to stay light hearted. If it's too much, take a break, stretch, try again tomorrow. I am not an expert but I hope this helps!",1

Went to my doctor the day after and told them and I was immediately set up with a psychiatrist and therapist. Sucks that you have to be suicidal in order to have your mental health prioritized. 

After a week of being too scared to drink, I realized how much better I felt already. I hate using the word “clarity”(thanks bachelor franchise) but that exactly how I felt. Waaaaay less anxiety, more energy, oh, and not feeling like shit every morning. I started waking up refreshed. It was easy to get up and go to work even though I had a really shitty dead end job at the time. My head was clear, and I knew I never wanted to feel that way again. 

I was lucky to be able to quit without major assistance. I have heard from family members that many free NA/AA groups help a lot. If you can, check your local churches/rec centers/online meetup groups to find one near you.",2

Yeah, a lot of it I only realized once I was able to distance myself from it and began viewing it objectively instead of going back into panic mode every time I remembered.

mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml79f0s,"Sounds like living at home is really taking a step back on you and causing you loads of stress, which is bleeding over to different factors of your life. The all in on work seems like a distraction from what is happening at home and could maybe also be described as coping to getting your mind off of your home. I would take a guess that the struggle with you not fitting in with your co-workers is simply your brain not used to the social aspect of work / life, which is so much more advanced and complex than your parents. That's supposed to happen! I would continue to try to get in touch with people your age or just somewhat of a normal social group that doesn't involve being home with your parents. I think going out to eat with your new friends is going to be **much** more of a benefit than eating with your parents at this stage of your life. I think it would be worth it when you are able to, to explore work / **life** and move closer to hobbies and friends. Good luck and reach out if you need anything.

  
Keep your head up",2
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7helx,"You’re doing more than you realize. The fact that you’re still showing up to work, still trying, still reaching out for support—*that* is strength. And even if your mouth won’t open sometimes, your spirit is still speaking. Loudly.

When your environment is draining, especially your home—what’s meant to be a place of recovery and safety—your nervous system is on constant alert. You’re not lazy. You’re not anti-social. You’re in survival mode. And that kind of exhaustion doesn’t just impact energy—it impacts connection, speech, even basic motivation. It's not a personality flaw. It’s biology doing its best to protect you.

You’ve already taken key steps. You’re building friendships, you’re exploring hobbies, and you’re actively trying to move out. That’s the groundwork. But there’s a piece you may be missing: fully *acknowledging* and validating what you’re enduring. Because trying to move forward without recognizing the real emotional weight you’re carrying is like trying to sprint with a heavy backpack—eventually your body just won’t comply.

Here’s what I would offer as further reflection:

First, give yourself permission to *not* perform. If you’re quiet at work, it doesn’t mean you’re less valuable. Start small—one sentence, one shared smile, one check-in message. Not to please them, but to keep a thread of connection alive without overwhelming yourself.

Second, consider creating a transitional ritual between home and work, even when working from home. It could be as simple as lighting a candle, taking a walk, or even changing your clothes. The brain needs cues to shift gears, especially when one space holds trauma and the other demands function.

Third, your housing situation may feel stuck, but it’s not hopeless. Look into housing organizations, rent guarantor services, or co-living options that cater to people in transition or without permanent contracts. Sometimes a creative or less conventional route can open a door.

And most importantly—know this: your exhaustion is valid. But your spirit is *still intact.* You’re not broken. You’re responding appropriately to a challenging environment. And there *will* be a turning point. Keep building what you’re building, brick by brick. Even if you can’t feel it yet, the foundation you’re laying now will carry you out of this.

You're not alone in this. You're just at a point where life is asking you to focus your energy inward, to protect what's sacred, and trust that the connections and clarity will return when you’ve got even one more ounce of peace in your external world.",2
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7cbja,"Hello, sorry but I feel like you didn't describe your mental health problems. Is it depression, anxiety, something else?",1
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,mmhm9q9,"Hey—I just want to say, I’m really glad you posted this. You’re clearly doing your best in a situation that sounds incredibly depleting, and the fact that you’re still trying to show up at work, explore new hobbies, and go to therapy says a *lot* about your resilience.

I’ve been in a similar space—where things at home were so overwhelming that just making it through the day left me emotionally wiped. What you described about your mouth not opening, not feeling anxious *but still feeling locked down*—that’s something I experienced too. For me, it wasn’t “just social discomfort,” it was a **shutdown response** from my nervous system trying to protect me when I had no more bandwidth.

Here are a few things that helped or might be worth exploring:

# 1. Name the shutdown for what it is—protection, not failure.

This isn’t about being antisocial or rude. Your system is likely so overstimulated from the stress at home that it’s gone into survival mode. It’s trying to conserve energy, not betray you. Once I started seeing that, I was less hard on myself.

# 2. Create micro-rituals between environments.

I found that having a small transition between home and work—even a 3-minute breathwork, journaling, or stretching practice—helped “separate” the chaos of one space from the demands of the other. Think of it like emotionally changing clothes.

# 3. Could your therapist increase frequency or switch focus?

If therapy is every two weeks and you’re in survival mode daily, you might not be getting enough rhythm to really shift things. Some therapists can do weekly or even short check-ins, especially during high-stress chapters like this.

# 4. Practice “low-effort connection” at work.

If full conversations feel impossible, sometimes a short Slack message like, *“Hey, I’m just a bit low energy this week—focused but quiet. Appreciate you all”* can ease pressure and create understanding. You’re not required to be a social butterfly to be a good teammate.

# 5. Keep trying to move—but remove the shame about being “stuck”

You *know* the current environment is hurting your mental health. That insight is powerful. If traditional renting feels blocked, maybe there’s an alternative—shared housing, a trusted friend, or even mental health orgs that can help with transitional living (depending on your region). You’re not failing—you’re just navigating something heavy with limited support.

You’ve clearly done a lot right. It’s okay if it hasn’t fully “lifted” yet. Some seasons aren’t solved quickly—but that doesn’t mean you aren’t moving forward.

You’re not broken. You’re just carrying more than most people can see.

And you’re absolutely not alone in it. 

Sending encouragement your way.",1

mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7hyaa,I see. Could it be dissociation? Like feeling sort of zoned out from what is happening around you?,1

mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7nghd,Okay. And could you describe the headspace you mentioned? Do you feel anything negative as a result of this?,1
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7p1rd,"It’s just very clouded. Oftentimes it feels as though I’m not thinking of anything at all. But it’s not a good feeling. 
It feels quite negative and as though I’m bringing other people down. I’ve noticed people will swap their in office days if it’s just us two in (multiple people and times so I know it’s not me overthinking). Puts me in a spiral but I know I haven’t done or said anything to upset people. Then I go home to a completely different level of negativity",1
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7ph0f,Alright. That sounds like the dissociation still. It tends to happen from experiencing stress. Do you think this stress is from not knowing what to say and from the need to be focused?,1
mentalhealth,1jqimxd,ml7qhi1,"I think my main stress comes from home, and then people now don’t really bother me at work even though I do want a connection. I just can’t give it fully.

mentalhealth,1l5n6l3,mwi89lj,"The issue is that many people have had a bad experience/heard a scary story about people with these issues. It’s a primitive thought pattern that makes them lump those of a single diagnosis into an “all bad” category. I’m careful about who I bring up my BPD/antisocial tendencies up around, especially as a woman, because other women in particular tend to be very judgmental of my issues. Thankfully it doesn’t bother me, but I’d imagine feeling shame on top of your mental illness would make it much more complex to treat.

The stigma is getting better though, I think there will be progress. Stuff like TikTok can both help and hurt, for obvious reasons. Unfortunately though, I think many laypeople will always be put off by those kinds of diagnoses. It activates the “possible threat” button in the reptile brain that many people aren’t educated enough to overcome",2
mentalhealth,1l5n6l3,mx46pfq,"I agree and this post does speak to me as someone with POCD, but I think your examples may be difficult to accept. You're absolutely right that it's not meant to be catered to or acceptable to society, however there's no society that can easily integrate a person with a history of cruelty towards animals and people, mental illness or not. That's a crime, and actions do indeed have consequences. Support and hope for recovery, absolutely, but that is different from love, and it is too much to ask people accept someone when they don't know if that person will ""snap"" tomorrow and harm them or those they care about.

That's not saying these conditions are stigmatized for a reason; they're wrongly stigmatized, shouldn't be stigmatized, and living life with these conditions can be unfair and difficult. But the best way you can love someone like that is by recognizing that, disordered or not, the consequences of their own past actions ensure that they can't just be embraced as they are and people have a right to be wary of who they were and now are.

mentalhealth,144n13d,jnhuq6v,"I imagine that you have a case here! I can actually speak from the ""employer side"" a little bit as well, as I recently had to terminate somebody due to Bipolar outbursts. As a person with severe Bipolar myself, it didn't feel good, but it did, unfortunately, feel right. I am currently being raked over the coals about it, and we may even have to give her a pay out, but I don't care. Good for her if she does.   


She was unfortunately unable to control her outbursts, during training she had to be excused multiple times, and during scenario based training she was unable to pass due to being unable to maintain a calm demeanor. She is fighting it, and she is also demanding accommodations. In general I do believe accommodations should almost always be met, but out in the field, when she is responsible for someone's life, there is absolutely no accommodation that I can grant her. Every failure that she displayed in training would have been an innocent person's life in the real world. I am not prepared to put that on her, nor do I feel that this is an acceptable risk in the emergency services world. I am also completely unwilling to accommodate her by having her on scene in an inactive role.   


I am having to put together very detailed writeups about every outburst, as well as provide the video footage that we have of them (which I HATE, because of just how unbecoming the footage is), and explain why I am unable to accommodate her during operations.   


When I say ""terminate"" I don't even mean fired, I mean just that I found her unsuitable for the job we do (We are a small, highly specialized team exclusively deployed when the situation is too unsafe for general duty employees) and had her sent back to her old position.   


This is going to be hell, and I am going to ""lose"" for sure, but in a weird way it is making me happy to see that there is this ability to advocate for yourself, and fight for yourself. I am happy that there are avenues that she was able to take, and I am happy that she may get something out of it too. Getting a pay out (we will 100% settle if it goes that way) for getting a position that you are unable to do doesn't quite send the right message either, but it's better than the opposite direction.",2

I would say maybe ignore the yearning for the company for a while.  Avoid making connections with anyone who might invade your privacy unconsciously.  Well done for dropping useless friends though",1
mentalhealth,1lxkfuy,n2n6yab,Feel free to DM,1
mentalhealth,1lxkfuy,n2nxu0j,"Yes, I’ve been through incredibly similar. So much so that I can at least infer a lot about you, and it’s
honestly jarring.

You seem immensely pragmatic, reasonable, and aware of yourself, which is why I’m being especially direct. I can never guarantee I’m right on understanding other people, so please give me an impression if I seem off about any of this.

You’re a social creature who is driven by connection with others. It isn’t the only thing that matters to you, but it’s nearly impossible for you to ignore that drive without shutting out every other ounce of joy with it. While you remove the stress and get rid of anxiety, depression is itself an utter lack of joy.

This in particular happens, in my experience and almost certainly yours, because you understand people indescribably well. It doesn’t seem odd at all to you, it’s perfectly natural, and it’s of course never itself perfect. You get stuff wrong sometimes. But still, it becomes incredibly easy to notice this.. gap of sorts. Why is it nobody can understand and relate to you? Why do you do these things, you help people as if it’s a given, yet so many others don’t do it for you?

It’s isolating to think that way, and you’re rather straightforward at solving problems like this. If others stress you, and only you can help yourself, what else can you even do? If it means being happy, if we can fully reason out that idea, it’s hard *not* to do it.

Now first, try to be aware of what is good for you. The idea of fighting for yourself is on overdrive right now, and a part of you likely believes that a shallow connection is harmful to you. I get it too, you got tired of how one sided things became and some things did need to change. This went too far though. You wanted what was good for you, and it isn’t.

There’s a balance to be had, between where you were before and are now. You care about people, you want to help others, but that does not mean you are *responsible* for them. You want others to help you, you want some reciprocity, but that doesn’t mean you *need* it. You’re resourceful, and you’re reliable. When you need a break, you can tell, and you can do whatever it is you need to destress. If something goes too far, you can stop it.

The other side I’d mention is that it isn’t just that you’re socially inclined (despite the contradictory social anxiety that seems to accompany us). You’re deeply motivated by connection and understanding. There likely isn’t a single thing that can motivate you more, or bring you more joy. Being kind is in itself deeply fulfilling. So, *keep being kind.* To yourself too, but also to others. Neither has to cancel the other out, and being aware of both has made incredible changes in how I interact with people.

This one, I’m more uncertain on how it may apply to you. But, in being driven to connect with and understand others, that also means that it’s fulfilling to even more deeply understand others. Like, almost aggressively understanding them, and constantly trying to recognize if you’re understanding is correct. It’s about the only way I’ve found to feel even remotely connected to people, because in understanding them so much, I can also actually *get* them to understand me. Or, maybe not directly me, but an idea that they otherwise wouldn’t understand.

Now, like I mentioned a bit, I could be entirely wrong. I find myself perpetually uncertain about others no matter how confident I otherwise come off. Which, usually isn’t very confident at all. I don’t know, I just see a lot in what you mention. I know there’s plenty of chance that, even if I do understand you decently, some of this may still seem difficult to fully agree with or is incorrect in some way, especially with just how much I put. I would genuinely like to know in any case, especially as long as I don’t come off as… too authoritative or something. This stuff genuinely is not easy, and nothing I put here I would even say I’m good at yet. Just what I’m trying to learn after a similar breaking point I had recently.",1
mentalhealth,1lxkfuy,n2pxih1,"Paragraph(P)  1-3: absolutely right. I've  made my life simple. And with that went social connections and almost all my anxiety. I have little reason for it in my own life, I am comfortable with the control I have in my own life. Mostly caused by other people. So right on that.

P 4-5: Right again, I share that with you. I tend to get people dialed in quite quickly. And exactly, can't always rely on that understanding and intuition. I try to be aware of it to allow myself to be surprised by people. In friendships, new and old that has typically lead to disappointment for the reasons you describe. Nobody truly understands me or relates to me at all. Especially because I come from a pretty unique situation and the nuance within it makes it hard for anybody to fully understand even if they'd try. And it's pretty upsetting to see as with some people I'm close to I see them better than they see themselves (mental health issues). And when people do think they understand me, they don't. Not really.  That friend of 10 years still thinks I am this unstable facade I play as to keep everyone laughing and happy, even as I constantly challenge that and prove I'm not.

I know why I do it. Helping people as a given and understanding them despite not being understood. It's circular. I do it because I want to be understood and I want to be loved and spread love. To be the person I needed growing up to make me feel happy and safe. To make sure no one else is left behind.

P 6-8: Great points. Exactly. I've gotten tired, again of how one sided things are, like many times before. And yes, the responsibility I feel I have for other people I am doing better about, but still struggle with. I'v given anyone going through it or who comes forward to me as much time as support as they want. I'm getting better at that. But still find myself in my head quite a lot, even after cutting ties with people that expect much more than reasonable for new connections. It'll affect my entire day and even sleep that day, I'll be thinking about what I could have done better for them or generally responsible, like ""what if they have nobody else."" Can't fall into that trap again. Have to stop.

And right that I'm socially inclined. It keeps me happy, I love being there for my people. And yes, kindness is everything. I have no plans on losing that. Even in isolation I'd poke my head out if someone cane knocking or texted. Focusing more on kindness to myself lately. While agreed, doing what I do for other people makes me quite happy and motivated, I've allowed a bit too much. Small bits of self erasure. Allowed people to take to much of my time and hadn't focused on myself as much as I'd like. Missed out and slowed a lot of my personal endeavors.

P9: I understand what you're saying, but yeah, same thing. Not quite sure how to apply that to my own life. In any case that I'm doing - understanding people the best I can, I feel like I'm  left standing, holding a rope, hoping someone will grab and pull the other end, but they just end up walking by, talking as they go. Maybe they do grab the rope, but it eventually gets used to smother me. Not because it's me. Just because I listened and it's just a given that I'll stay. I'm still not ever understood for who I am and I get sick and start losing my breath.

I'm going to continue doing things the way you described, just trying to understand others the best I can. Can't think of any other way to go about it. As you said, I don't need reciprocity, though it's nice. At least I'm in the door this way. Until I find a different way.

P10: You're good. You've understood and described me quite well. In ways I'd never say aloud or describe to another person because as is the trend with everything: not much of anybody would understand. People either don't understand why or think we're trying to flatter ourselves, when really this can just be miserable. I'll definitely update you if I get any answers or developments.

This friend clearly knows they are off.  They seem to me to be trying to put a level to it.  Yes she can be on some kind of medications for her symptoms and yet be completely misdiagnosed and/or undiagnosed.  The last time I saw a psychiatrist they didn't spend much time diagnosing before they prescribed me meds.    
She learned how to manage her anxiety it didn't ""go away"" The person who claimed to have 3 mental breakdowns it might have seemed like that to them.  A mental breakdown has various degrees.

Even with OCD, there is a reason why they do it.  A person with OCD is typically a class A personality they got straight A's in school and would be upset with a b.

As an adult you will see them in some cases cut carrots with a ruler nearby to make sure each piece is the same length.  Some will even have only a certain number of anything on their plate.  I knew a person with ocd and she would only allow an even number of anything on her plate and would count her peas to make sure there was an even number.  It causes them anxiety if they are not perfect.    
I have anxiety.  I would check my keys for fear that I would loose them and have to call someone for help and I would seem stupid or irresponsible.  This is also a most likely ptsd stemming from years of abuse sometimes the attacks were over my forgetting to do something.

Disfunctional upbringings cause a lot of ""mental illness"" if you look up the 15 cognitive disfunctions, you will realize society norms are training us to think disfunctionally... downloading the episode on my podcast and channel of #1-#7 as we speak.

I have a podcast for the same purpose of this type discussion if youre interested. Let me know how i can help your efforts... i do have several stories however maybe by sharing yours i will know more about what direction you are going.

Helping someone online is never going to be a subtitute for a professional that can give you a proper diagnose and can point you to the right people to help you along to recover. 

I get the idea, its a good gesture and the stigma has to be adressed in order to further society. But without that professional diagnose and framework, you can do more harm than good. 

Hence why experience workers in my country are working alongside therapists instead of on their own.",3
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0r315i,"There are several myths that increase stigma, reduce recovery and cause harm.
Suffering is not an illness. An illness is something physically, and biologically wrong that causes harm.  For decades research has found that people with depression have the same serotonin levels as non-depressed people. Likewise applies for all mental labels and chemicals. Depression is a description of feelings and behaviors. It literally can’t be an illness because an illness is a biological problem not a description of feelings. 

Most people 85% of those with depression and even 80% of those labeled with schizophrenia who do not take the deadly addicting psychiatric drugs recover and have pretty normal lives.

The drugs themselves increase the very symptoms they treat. Antipsychotics increase psychosis by 300% and antidepressants increase depression by 80%. 
Of course the people selling these drugs trot out junk science claiming their drugs are awesome. But we know for a fact they committed fraud, and lied. We can read their studies and know they cherry picked the data, put the placebo group through withdrawal and unblinded the drug group.

Just get out. And get an education.",1
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0sjnv6,Wild. I work with persons who suffer from depression and the physical pain and impact on cognitive functioning is real. This is why this topic is important to discuss. It's hard to make progress in this area when the response to wanting to explore this topic is almost always met by people who can rattle off information from reviews- who- God knows what the initial hypothesis was for any of the material refered to - and  want to push their own agenda of denial. I support discussing mental health issues because it's a complex and actual condition that truly affects a person's quality of life and that can be treated.,2
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0shhoa,"So according to you over 200 scientific research studies from dozens of countries, organizations and people are all complete shit. 
You can’t say why, use any evidence, logic or intelligence but you sure can use some logical fallacies and insults. Do you know what projection is?",1
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0sjl3i,"I am a doctor. And I can tell you for sure that antipsychotics and antidepressants WORK. Sometimes they need to be changed for better response but if you say e.g. schizophrenia is treated without drugs I can only say you are misinformed and uneducated and your opinions hold no merit. Nothing more, nothing less.

That is all.",1
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0sq3fl,"Did they teach you to use appeal to authority and ad hominem logical fallacies in med school? 
Do you know what a false equivalence logical fallacy is? It’s where you pretend your unsupported claims are the same as the evidence research and facts. 

Let’s recap this discussion.
I posted the research facts and evidence. You posted insults, and logical fallacies. Meaning all your insults are actually you projecting.",1
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0sqbcd,"No, kind sir, you wrote that medications don't work and posted some links.

I explained meds work and there are countless treatment guides including them.

You are wrong. There may be people here trying to deal with grave mental illness and see your post and refuse treatment and die or out others in deadly danger due to its plain false claims.

You can bloody bet I will insult any post like yours.",1
mentalhealth,i5laj7,g0svf8c,"Saying “they work” is not explaining anything. It’s not evidence or science based. 

The VA found that Veterans without a mental label who took the drugs had 50% higher suicide rates compared to veterans with a label who did not take the drugs.

Antidpressants increase suicides by 250%.

Antidepressants are deadlier than an alcohol addiction.

When your response to the evidence is insults, projection and logical fallacies you lost the debate and are simply flailing.

mentalhealth,1ljlrk6,mzkqodl,"Please just do not take the benzodiazepines alongside any other medication’s or supplements without at least consulting your pharmacist or prescribing provider. I can only speak to some of the therapy methods you have tried. They are evidence based treatments for anxiety, however, sometimes for therapy to truly work it relies more on the connection you have with your therapist. A lot of clinicians now are trained on manuals, which are great when you’re learning as they give you a security blanket however, some of it comes down to truly connecting with another person in that moment in time.",3
mentalhealth,1ljlrk6,mzlucol,"I'm talking to a professional in about a months time. I just want to be diagnosed so I know I really am not sick in the head. Although overtime it's started bothering me less and less.

If I tell anyone about it, perhaps family or friend or yk, it just all feels generic. Same shit, different ways it has been said to me. 

I need more than advice, but at the same time, I can't speak for everyone. Someone might find it helpful idk, but it depends on the severity on whatever condition it is you are experiencing.",2
mentalhealth,1ljlrk6,mzluoiz,"The fact is, there are physical conditions at play that disrupt your brain’s ability to reverse course once it becomes overactive. Panic attacks are not caused by character flaws, “wrong thinking”, diet, etc… the fact that you have been incredibly proactive in trying to find an answer and have ended up in the ER on multiple occasions is evidence that your brain is in some way malfunctioning and a medical intervention is necessary. Benzodiazepines are actually the appropriate treatment, as you’ve discovered. 

The misinformation and the anti-benzodiazepines cult reached a level of hysteria that forced the World Health Organization, Medicare and Medicaid to place them on their protected drugs list to prevent doctors from de-prescribing  or not prescribing them to as first line treatments. 

Xanax is not the right benzodiazepine for panic disorder as it’s fast acting but has a short half life.  A longer acting benzodiazepine like Klonopin is very effective for panic disorder. With Xanax, you would have to take several doses throughout the day to get the effects of 1 dose of Klonopin. 

Hopefully you can find a doctor that still practices evidence based medicine and puts a premium on quality of life.",1

I’m sorry you had bad experiences and lost trust in professionals and medication. 

I still hope you can find the courage to try again and connect with professionals who truly listen and take your experiences seriously. Therapy and medication can help relieve the intense stress you’re dealing with and are much safer than relying on hot water or caffeine.

mentalhealth,l4xbnp,gkrnlaw,"It is so hard to escape an entire family that feeds off of narratives they rely on for their own emotional stability. The dirty secret is that everyone has mental problems but people like me, with a bipolar diagnosis, I carry the weight of their denial. 

I am lucky in that I have a deep, spiritual connection with my higher power. Even if I can't feel it sometimes, I've profoundly felt it enough to remember each day that my feelings are not wrong and enough positive steps in a row leads to rewards or even miracles.

Minimizing our most damaging actions and making strides while making special note of what has worked and what hasn't can take you far. Sometimes switching the set of characters and the setting makes this process smoother. 

I was in a homeless shelter for awhile last month and came out of it a little bit better. 

The disconnect between how I feel and how my family treats me is the most frustrating when I am feeling good about myself but all my family sees is the negatives. Like I'm just a list of bad life statistics.

These individuals see themselves as okay and not in need of self improvement so it's easier for them to put all of their problems on a scapegoat. Anyone can be manic when they face stigmatism for years on end. 
I hoped 2020 would make everyone realize that nobody is better than anyone else and we all have to work on ourselves. 

Fuck em",6
mentalhealth,l4xbnp,gkrv79u,"What social media do you use? Bc honestly, tho I haven’t deleted it yet- FB is toxic asf and I had to stop going on there. However I don’t even bother with Twitter or insta or anything like that; I sometimes comment on here and like, very, very occasionally YT and omg even YT is soooo hateful lol I’m like ok wow! If comments are anything to go by I have to believe that all platforms are basically the same attitude...and seriously I don’t understand how ANYONE can use insta everyone is so fake and ridiculous. 

So, solutions (from someone basically hanging on by a thread so- take with a grain of salt, lol!) Block anyone at the first sign of hostility, you don’t need it and you don’t have time for it. From what I’ve seen, forums are where it’s at for community but pick something online where you know full well it’s a safe space where you CAN vent and be supported, and lean on that as you would a friend! Lately I’ve been pretty terrified of this reality, knowing someone’s getting sick of you bc you’re a hot mess and end up being negative/self-indulgent but at the same time you’re trying to crawl out of the funk so- impasse city. What’s helped me and it might help you is to keep a journal, I know it sounds so dumb but hear me out- you get to vent allllll your frustrations and so-called “crazy” phobias and idiosyncrasies and what’s catching all that flack is an inanimate BOOK, and maybe you yourself; you don’t have to unload any baggage on anyone else. Just get it OUT. Not to mention, it rly can help clear up some scattered thoughts and feelings you may not know you had...then, with a somewhat clearer head, you can more intelligently articulate your feelings to a loved one without sounding like you’re just whinging. (Eg, ‘well I feel like X bc of Y and Z, but I was thinking if I did ABC to try and better myself I’d actually get some results- what do you think?’ u know, instead of just, ‘I’m feeling blank...’ which rly is hard to respond to sometimes, and is a straight-up emotional dump). People will be more inclined to listen if you actually turn it into a feasible conversation, and take up responsibility for your own emotional labor. And you could always just say, hey I’m feeling like blank today, can I have a [hug/kiss/shoulder to cry on/ear to vent to/cup of coffee lol wtv you need]? I mean clearly idk what kind of relationships you have, but if the rapport is there sometimes it’s easier to just directly and honestly state what you need, ESP if it’s something as simple as a hug; the other person will most likely be overjoyed at being able to help you in the moment, even in a small way.

TL;DR- Limit social media/strategically utilize social media; JOURNAL!!, be empathetic toward your loved ones as well as yourself...try and provide them an out in difficult conversations when speaking abt your own struggles (bc yes, sometimes ppl just DONT wanna hear it, they have their own issues and that’s totally okay!! It doesn’t mean they hate you or you’re not important- it takes mental energy and strength to be there for someone else) and don’t be afraid to ask for help, if you are afraid start by asking in small ways.

Anyway sry for rambling but, I hope this helps somewhat? But hey if not, you can always PM me and I will gladly listen. xD Just remember to go easy on yourself, you’re just 1 person and you’re doing the best you can!",5

It's something to do with not having things the way you want them, for some reason outside of you. That means something disappointed you, you got cheated out of something, and so forth. 

That causes a low level ""oppositional defiant"" pattern of behavior. That's why you have no ambition or interest in stuff and come off as a moocher. 

Alfred Adler used to describe that as ""discouragement"" where the definition of ""courage"" is to have the belief in doing positive things even though they are challenging/scary. Disappointment create a ""can't do"" and ""Won't happen"" attitude.

But after my years of therapy, medication, support from my true friends and family and a lot of individual growth I learnt to take control of it all, I still suffer from depression everyday but I know how to counter it. I promise if you keep looking after yourself even when the shit hits the fan you will be able to live a normal life, with a family and a job but most importantly and good sense of peace and tranquillity.  


As for the negative view people have on people with mental health issues/disorders yeah it sucks, Psychology and mental health really hasn't been seen as a real science for long and the stigma and false education is still strong. This is were we have to step up and educate.

mentalhealth,l4xbnp,gkv6gmg,"I’m terribly sorry that this has been your experience OP. I agree 100% with what you are saying about social media though. It seems to reinforce and perpetuate the idea that we are fundamentally different as human beings; thereby, exacerbating and accelerating the rate of animosity and hatred toward one another. In reality, despite perceived differences, we are more alike than we are different. I know it can seem like throwing darts in the wind, but I use my social to put love and acceptance back into the cesspool of hatred and division. 

It’s important to remember that therapists are humans too. Like you, I struggle with depression. Also, Anxiety, ADHD, and addiction. I remember when I gave up alcohol, I imagined life would instantly become more palatable. But, new problems present themselves. I, like you, tried therapy and support groups like AA. I found that although twelve step programs work for many people, they did not for me. What finally worked to get to a manageable place was keeping myself busy, working CBT, and practicing meditation daily. 

No matter what OP, I just want you to know that you are loved and absolutely worthy. Even on those darkest of days when the world around you seems to crack, I hope you can pull to mind that one random comment on Reddit of someone who just honestly gave a @&$&. All the best!",2

mentalhealth,l4xbnp,gks85ms,I completely agree it is absolutely terrible and great at the same time. It depends on what social media as to the level of toxicity though. Reddit is easily the most toxic of them all but at the same time I’ve met some amazing people here. But simply opinions can get you hated. When I was new to Reddit and stuck to supportive communities like this one I figured I’d go to a different community to express a political opinion. It was so hated it was unbelievable. And all I said was that I’m not automatically racist since I’m from the south. Boy that was stupid of me. So now I stay In the slightly more loving communities. But no doubt that the hate I witnessed there had an effect on me. I wouldn’t be surprised if I get hate here for that but still reddit is the only place where I can find support.,1

Sometimes it helps to have something to focus on and work towards that may not be easy in the present, but afterwards you can look back and take pride in. The truth is, the longer you put off working towards something you can take pride in, the harder it becomes to build self esteem.

But for the last 2-3 years, tktk has been flooding my page with autistic pages, and at first i didnt think much of it, bc there are a lot of commonalities btwn BPD and autism, and also childhood trauma, and other disorders.

mentalhealth,1lcc2y1,mxzl1pm,"I dont have kids, but I was a sensitive kid growing up with parents who didnt understand me. My best suggestions will be based on what I would have benefitted from growing up, besides therapy. 
1. Being present, with your children, asking them how they are feeling, being non-judgmental and encourage them to share their emotions. You probably cant fix them, but knowing that they can share their feelings in a safespace is important. (This takes time)
2. Find other adults(sisters, brothers, friends..) whom can be supporting and loving humans for your so . Sometimes we need to be close with and seen by other people than our parents.
3. Encourage (not push/force) your child to engage in social activities they feel okay in, dont matter if its one on one. Probably even online friends could be helpful. Combating lonliness is extremely important, and easier when you are in your teens than later. 
4. Make them feel important in the household, like they are a part of it and teach them to cook, clean ect. This builds selfesteem, being able to participate and do importants jobs. Yes cleaning and cooking are important. 
5. The dope sounds like a really bad idea, but its not gonna stop before he decides to, its about generating selfesteem to believe in a better life for themselves. Which you can help with. 
6. It already seems like you really care about him, and thats probably the most important.

I'm not sure what exactly he has, but he has a similar issue with pervasive body odor. As his sister who lived with him, it was BAD, and only recently has he started making changes. The Big Winners I've noticed helping him are:
- Putting all clothes in plastic bags when not in use. His living space is covered in his smell, so isolating the fabrics that soak up the smell keep the clothes fresh. He uses garbage bags but I imagine any bag that isn't ""soft"" or made of fabric will work
- Giving up on ""smelling good"" and instead opting for a ""controlled smell"". He uses very pungent bug spray for this. It stinks, but people are much more willing to be around him due to the association. Body odor makes people think he's unclean, but strong smelling bug spray covers that up and gives off an ""outdoorsy"" vibe instead. Very pungent sunscreen may give the same results!

mentalhealth,1ljp507,mzlxvru,"First life style changes:

The biggest thing you can do for yourself is to become physically active. Exercise is as effective as an antidepressant for mild to moderate depression. This means if your depression is severe you really do need to talk to a doctor, also if you find you are becoming paranoid same thing, you really really need to go to a doctor. 

Find something you enjoy, walking, weight lifting, badminton, rock climbing, etc. If you can’t find something you enjoy, find which one you hate the least. Find it and do it. Do it until your muscles are at least a little tired. Finding how much exercise your body can take can be a trial and error thing. This means you may first start out with a 30 minute walk at the end of the day and over the course of a year transition to non-stop running for the same duration. 


Change your diet.

Eat fish a couple of times a week, sardines are best but if you can’t get yourself to eat them, try canned mackerel. Mackerel has the omega-3 fatty acids of sardines but the meatiness and lack of bones of tuna, also it doesn’t really have a fishy taste/smell in my opinion. I suggest anything from King Oscar brand, it’s a solid brand and most of their food is middle of the line or great especially for the price. What you see in most grocery stores is the bottom of the barrel, there are cans of canned fish that can go for like 15$ a can. 

Fun thing about supplements is that it’s unregulated so you really want to buy from companies that have been around for like a decade. Also stay away from concoctions that are like “heart defenders 5000 all your heart needs” thats a marketing tactic. 

I personally shoot for around 600-700mg of omega-3 fatty acids a day. I do this by taking fish oil pills, but I know that is something you have a problem with. I will suggest staying away from the gummies, they just aren’t the best. You can buy fish oil in a bottle (liquid no pills nor tablets) and just take a spoon of it a day (or whatever the bottle says) start small. I suggest keeping your fish oil in a refrigerator. 

See about accessing your last physicals blood work information. If you have low vitamin D levels consider taking a supplement. You can find it sold in droppers or in gummies. 

Just don’t over do it, some people think the more you take the better you are when it comes to supplements but it’s all about balance. 

Water soluble vitamins you can take a lot of, generally speaking, but fat soluble vitamins like vitamin D you can really over do it and when you over do it bad things happen. 

Increase your fiber intake, best way to do this is to eat beans, and carb balance tortillas and keto bread. You want between 25-30mg of fiber a day. Start small, pay attention to how much fiber you eat in a normal day and increase it by 5 grams a week. Honestly you can go above the listed amount just do it slowly or you can have digestive upset, gas etc. 

Try and get good sleep. No phone in your bed. Sleep is when our brain is cleaned by cerebral spinal fluid, removing all the gunk. It’s also when memories are consolidated, retained. Practice muscle relaxation to help you fall asleep. 

Keep go to therapy if you can, and really practice CBT.

Sorry this is confusing i know but for simpler terms, Everyone who is diagnosed has feelings of anxiety, but not everyone with feelings of anxiety has the diagnosable condition.

3.  Just like the plethora of antidepressants and benzodiazepines that are out there, different strains of weed can have a different effect on your brain.  To just assume that all weed can be good for any depression, mood, or anxiety disorder...it just doesn't make sense.  I wish things were that simple, but it just isn't.

mentalhealth,95ob1s,e3uukrw,Weed actually helps me. If I feel really bad and I smoke weed it helps me stop thinking about it but if it's a really negative thing it makes me think about it and just just sit and cry for hours but it mostly helps so I still smoke it. ,2

mentalhealth,95ob1s,e3uprnu,"Well the thing is that not everyone reacts the same way to cannabis, or even different strains. At the end of the day THC which is the main component of recreational cannabis, is psychoactive, and by no means helpful to most people's mental health. Especially people who already have mental health issues. In contrast the other main cannabinoid CBD is antipsychoactive, and it helps soothe symptoms of anxiety and depression. I would not recommend smoking unprocessed THC rich cannabis for anyone suffering from mental health issues. THC can aggravate paranoia, irritability, fatigue, cause hallucination, and elevate anxiety. For pain and anxiety CBD extracts would be the safest for people with concerns about their mental health and do not cause a ""high"". ",1

Now that I've been diagnosed bipolar, I've been reading mixed research: some shows a distinctive psychotic reaction, others show a good mellow effect. Unfortunately, none of the studies I've found has taken strain into account. For now, I've given it up, until studies come out saying that a particular strain can stabilize moods in bipolar, or at least can treat depressive episodes without contributing to psychosis.

Ketamine, on the other hand, is supported by many studies, and I can tell! I just can't get it easily, and there are no infusion clinics near by.",1

You'd think it would be the other way round - weed and munchies and all. And maybe there hasn't been that much change - it's just it doesn't feel like binge-eating compulsion, just a tasty munch-a-thon.

I'm hoping it's just a case of willpower limits. While I'm still getting used to not indulging I don't have enough willpower left to to not binge eating and therefore will get better once I get used to this.

I suspect, however, that the issue is my weed use covered up mental health issues I'm needing to address and that's why the binge eating is coming out.

mentalhealth,95ob1s,e3v3rg4,"I used to love weed. I smoked every night for over a year. Then one day, took a few hits, left to pick up a friend to go get some ice cream at McDonalds, and on the way there I started experiencing chest pains in the left side, dizziness, lightheadedness, very fast and hard heartbeats, some disorientation, and an intense feeling of fear [to clarify a little, the chest pain was likely from scoliosis I didn't know I had at the time, the dizziness, lightheadedness, crazy heartbeat, and intense fear was likely from the panic that set in almost immediately, and the disorientation was probably a combination of panic and being high]. I honest to God thought I was having a heart attack at 22 years old. I went to the hospital in an ambulance, just to be told shortly after I got there my bloodwork was good and my heart is fine, if a little fast (panic attack, but they didn't actually tell me that. That was realized in hindsight). They referred me to a cardiologist, did some tests, he said I was fine. Kept having crazy symptoms, multiple intense panic attacks and ambulance rides, from start to finish all this lasted about 4-5 months, I was on edge almost the entire time. Finally found out I have scoliosis, which accounted for the recurring chest pains, and EVERY other symptom I had was anxiety related. Ever since that first panic attack, I have never been able to fully enjoy marijuana, no matter how much I might want to. I have a panic attack almost every time I try, and if not then I'm so anxious about the possibility of having one that I can't enjoy it. ",0

The second time I smoked it I felt super paranoid like somebody was out to get me and I knew it wasn't true but I still felt it. I felt paranoid the next 5 or so times I did it after my first time. The only reason i kept doing it was because I knew I could get a good experience out of it and wanted to experience that again.

mentalhealth,1kfuzgh,mqtwh7t,"First question, do you want what you are studying? Do you want to be in college in the first place?

Who is paying for your tuition?

One reason i got through college was because we are poor and having a nursing degree will give me a job. It wasn't easy to study while debt collectors are after your family. My mom has to skip town every now and then to hide from debt collectors. My only way out of this was to finish college and get a job. This pushed me to study harder (not an A student though). To cut the long story short, i graduated, got a job and somewhat debt free (we paid the old debts. Now, i have a mortgage and a car loan)

I guess my point is, what is motivating you?",2
mentalhealth,1kfuzgh,mqtxqlk,"yea, understanding what motivates you is important to make sure you get to do what you love. It's really difficult to figure that out when you are young as your interest keeps changing. I too was going through this phase for a while.",1
mentalhealth,1kfuzgh,mqu5h4d,"First, my parents are paying for my college. They are fairly well-off and I currently go to an in-state university which they are able to pay for, which I'm really grateful for.

Second, I struggled with deciding what I wanted to study for a while. Because my parents are paying for my schooling, they've always had an expectation that I tended to follow -  find a career by doing what I'm good at, to make more money, instead of what I enjoy. I was always good at math so my parents wanted me to go into business/analytics but the more classes I took, the more I realized I hated it. Recently I decided to switch to a psychology and math double major because I already had math credits and psychology is was I truly enjoyed. They were not happy about this when I told them. I explained to them that I would be happy to pay for grad school, which would likely be required, but they were only worried about me not making ""enough"" money.

Third, I guess my motivations have shifted. I have a super successful sibling and all I wanted was to live up to her and make my parents happy with me because I was always the ""problem child"" of the family. Now, I just want to do something that helps other people. I've always been super empathetic and caring towards people, and learning how to help them sounds super interesting, which I guess is why I've been drawn to studying psych.",1
mentalhealth,1kfuzgh,mqvi7sj,"Did your parents come from a poor background? The reason parents push their children to go where money is is because of security. This is very common in Asian communities. (I am Asian). Our economy is not the best, the competition is tough, and there are not a lot of opportunities to go around.

Anyway, I digress. Going back to your situation. Just be honest with them. If it will end up them not paying for your college and allowance, so be it. I will not play the ""it's my life, my choice"" card. Rather, tell them that you will live through whatever decision you make or they make. When they (parents) die, you will be left with your own life and you don't want to live a life you are not happy about. You will be left on our own to manage your life.

mentalhealth,1jivswk,naechzs,"I think it does.
I have had no drug or alcohol habit.
The only habit I had was masturbation from a young age. 
I started prone masturbation to magazines since age of 7. I carried this out until i was able to ejaculate at age 10 or so. 
I carried doing this until age of 12 when I was addicted to porn. 
I carried out masturbation until my mid 20s. Soo I must have ejaculated alot.
My life has had soo many problems because of my mind feeling detached and unreal. I feel like I have lost my mind and soul as everything looks far away and 2D.

I feel as if my brain has melted or something.i struggle with this everyday, as if a part of my brain has disappeared or disintegrated.

I have this feeling inside me that's telling me the way I'm perceiving life isn't how I should be perceiving life and something in my brain or body is missing giving me this unreal feeling.


I'm sure it's worse than doing drugs 
I feel I'm the only one with this problem.

I have had severe panic and anxiety attacks and I truly believe I have melted a part in my brain in one of the lobes or something to do with the transmitters in my brain. People talk about the reward system in my brain with dopamine, but I believe my problem is more severe and has to do with physical part of my brain.",1
mentalhealth,1jivswk,mjifgj7,"I agree that different people have different libidos, and masturbation itself isn’t inherently harmful. However, when it becomes excessive or compulsive, it can have significant mental health effects. Studies have shown that overindulgence in masturbation, especially when tied to adult content, can lead to dopamine desensitization, making everyday pleasures feel dull. Some people experience brain fog, social withdrawal, and even symptoms of anxiety or depression when they rely on it as a coping mechanism rather than addressing deeper emotional struggles.

Also, excessive stimulation can create unrealistic expectations about intimacy, making real relationships feel less rewarding. It’s not about saying masturbation is bad, but rather recognizing when it starts affecting one’s mental and emotional well-being. Have you ever noticed any of these effects in yourself or others?",1
mentalhealth,1jivswk,mjij15y,"I don’t think masturbation is the problem. I think the problem is more so that we are not talking about, education, and normalizing sex and so couples are inadequately prepared to have conversations about their expectations and relationship agreements about sex and intimacy within their relationships.

mentalhealth,1jivswk,mjinr84,"I think that it is up for the couple to decide for themselves about what works for their unique relationship and those decisions should be rooted in accurate sex education. Masturbation isn't harmful and doesn't cause those problems its the messaging and shame that lead to depression or any other negative symptoms. Masturbation is healthy for relationships because it helps people take care of their sexual needs without relying on their partner to fulfill every single one of their sexual needs and urges. That can put a lot of pressure on a relationship. But with that being said it's for the couple to decide what works for them. Yes there are other forms of intimacy apart from sexual that help build emotional connection and bonding that are important as well, but most couples want a strong sexual connection and sex looks different in every relationship and that is not right, wrong, good, or bad as long as both parties are consenting",1

mentalhealth,1jrc6ze,mldg20r,"What you’re experiencing is more common than you might think, and you’re absolutely not alone in this. It may feel like a sudden collapse, but what you’re actually seeing is your nervous system giving you a very loud message: something in your environment, your thoughts, or your physiology has overwhelmed the capacity you built when things were stable.

This isn’t failure. This is feedback.

Mental health is not something we “solve” once and for all. It’s more like a relationship—we tend to it, we learn from it, and when we neglect it or life overwhelms it, it calls us back to care for it again. The good news is that you recognized the signs early this time. That’s massive progress. That means the work you did five years ago didn’t disappear—it gave you the tools and awareness to not fall as hard this time.

Relapsing into anxiety or depressive states doesn’t mean you’ve lost everything you gained. It means something within you is calling out again for your attention, for care, for balance. And that’s not weakness. That’s your body and mind trying to protect you, even if the signals are uncomfortable.

What you do now matters more than the fact that it happened. So yes, reach out. Talk to a therapist again, consider the tools that helped you last time—maybe even medication if necessary. But more than anything, be radically compassionate with yourself right now. The self-harm thoughts aren’t a sign of who you are. They’re signals that you’re in pain and need support.

So let’s not ask “Why is this back?” Let’s ask “What is life trying to show me through this?”

Because this isn’t the end of your strength. It’s the beginning of your next level of awareness and healing.",11
mentalhealth,1jrc6ze,mllzcz0,"I do this way more than I can count. I am told I need to stay on my medication, but something happens, and I go off cold turkey. I have been told that I have a bad chemical imbalance and my brain doesn't produce what is needed of serotonin, and have been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, so being medicated helps keep me at times straight. 

If you ever feel like you are doing good and don't need to be medicated, it means the medication is working, so keep up with it. 

I want to applaud you for asking for help when you need it. I hope things get better and you start feeling better. 🥰",1

mentalhealth,1ksnxdm,mtrmf4f,"Sometimes life throws us unexpected curveballs, and we may not know how to deal with what’s going on. I’ll just give some counterpoints to some of what you wrote:

“I’m trying to give her space and won’t be messaging her any more as I don’t want to stress her out.”
It’s good to see that you’re trying to respect her boundaries and privacy. If she gets to a place where she wants to tell you, she will. Until then you have to accept that she either doesn’t want to or isn’t in a healthy place to do so.

“But I’m now really struggling with my mental health knowing that the biggest day of my life will be without my best friend.”
How would your perspective change if you knew that your friend may have just received the worst news of her life, and that her condition will affect her every single day?

“Every picture will have her missing.”
What if she attends because of feeling guilty? Every picture will be a reminder of how she had to hide what she was struggling with to make someone else happy.

“Every laugh will be consumed with guilt that she isn’t there.”
And if she were there, what if every laugh was a reminder of the joy she isn’t experiencing, and the happiness that may be less frequent in her life because of her diagnosis?

“She is one of the most important people in the world to me.”
There’s a quote from Maya Angelou that says “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” If your best friend is going through something so difficult for her that she doesn’t want to speak with you about it, how would you like her to remember how you made her feel?",1
mentalhealth,1kprdzj,mt00fbe,"Honestly, it depends on the person.  But what I did was just say something along the lines of ""I'm going through some stuff right now. or ""Some stuff happened in the past, that makes it difficult for me."" a lot of people were understanding and stopped there, but if someone questions you further just be honest and say you don't want to talk about it. Most people will stop at that point since the reason they asked you in the first place was to offer help and they don't want to make things worse for you.",2

mentalhealth,1ken7lh,mqkq1wk,"I didn't get to travel FOR my mental health but I did travel WITH mental health issues. Slight nuance here.

I think it depends on your personality, your interests and your goals when traveling. 

I have found that a change of pace and environment always feels good, but at the same time, I don't like being rushed, I have little interests in most historical sites. While I do exercise and walk, I am not a fan of hiking and tiring exercise. I exercise to maintain health but I am underweight so I have no reason not desires to push myself. Enduring a long track to a pyramid in the jungle is absolutely not a pleasant experience for me and I would never willingly participate. Stressing out for days from tourist spot to tourist spot in Rome sounds like a headache more than an enjoyable vacation. 

But sleeping in a bead and breakfast for a week in a remote village in France or Portugal, enjoying the scenery, maybe taking the bus once or twice to go see some monuments worth seeing. That's more my cup of tea. 

I have also found I get the same refreshing feeling from going to place much closer to home than I imagined. My partner and I temporarily lives separately because of his work. Same country, only cities appart, but we have no car so visits have to be planned. I've lived in my city since I was born. My city is not small, and we're he lives, I always assumed wasn't really all that urban. So I was pleasantly surprised when I went to visit him. Very urban city but with a much much different vibe than the city we met in. Just that was enough of a breath of fresh air for me. I actually would love moving in that city someday. 

Sometimes, just going to new places in your own country can give you the same sense of adventure.",1

mentalhealth,1jo0ejb,mko2okh,"Talking about is great, but it's talking about it with the right people. As you have stated, there is a shortage in psychiatrists and counsellors because we're being burnt out and have to put ourselves first. Some are unable to return because of the taxing effects it has on our own mental health. Right now I'm quite resilient and I could see myself doing this for years to come, however that could change at any moment. I want to help more people but I need to recognize my limitations, no use to anyone if I'm burnt out. 

There are many reasons to why mental health is on the rise and one of the biggest reasons I believe is social media. We need to regulate that shit better and get kids off it or get them using it less.",2
mentalhealth,1jo0ejb,mkqnmjq,Editing this to add sources would be helpful.,1
mentalhealth,1jo0ejb,mko2w8j,"I agree, but not necessary that we need a psychiatrist to talk to. It can be your friends, parents, siblings, etc with whom you can talk about this.",1
mentalhealth,1jo0ejb,mko44mm,"It's completely necessary, your friends and family can be a great support system, but they can't provide you the tools necessary to deal with mental health problems long term. 

Would you say the same if it was a physical health condition?  Can your friends and family treat a heart condition? 

Don't get me wrong, I can see what you're getting at, but talking about it with friends and family is a good first step, but they cannot replicate what a therapist can provide nor should you expect them to. 

Therapy comes with a cost which some cannot afford, I get that and therefore an alternative is required. If you look around, there are often support groups happening in community centres, churches ECT... Again this doesn't replicate a therapist's work, but can be a great support system.",2

As you mentioned there's a lot going on very stressful in your life. 

I would think working with a therapist and following good sleep, eat, self-care could be a good start. Easier said than done but fingers crossed for you.",1
mentalhealth,1js1dg9,mljlzw7,"You are not alone. And even if your world feels like it’s fallen apart beyond repair, there’s a part of you—right now—that still wants to find a way forward. That’s the part that wrote this. That’s the part that *wants to live*, even when everything else feels dead inside.

You’re not broken. You’re *grieving*. And grief isn’t linear or clean. It’s chaotic. It rips through every part of your identity—your role in your family, your relationships, your sense of safety, your sense of self. When you lost your father, you didn’t just lose a person. You lost a structure, a future, a sense of how the world works. And now everything feels scattered.

Your actions—the lying, the cheating, the spiraling—aren’t signs that you’re a bad person. They’re signs that you’re drowning. And when people drown, they don’t swim gracefully. They flail. They gasp. They grab onto anything that might help them breathe. What matters now isn’t judgment—it’s *understanding*.

Your guilt, your eating disorder, your insomnia, the constant anxiety—these are all signals that your system is overwhelmed. You don’t need to fix *everything*. You need to begin *somewhere*.

Right now, you’re standing in the rubble. You’re tired, you’re hurting, and you feel like no one understands. But listen—*you are still here*. Despite all of this, you’re *still here*. And that is the most powerful, stubborn, miraculous act of life.

So what do you do now?

You start where you are. And where you are is in pain. But pain isn’t the enemy. Pain is a guide. It’s pointing you toward what needs love, attention, and healing.

First: You need support. Not isolation. Your therapist moved away. That’s a loss too. But it’s *not* the end of therapy. You *can* find someone else. And you don’t have to do it alone. Let someone help you—your ex, a friend, even your doctor. Tell them: *I need help finding a new therapist. I can’t do it by myself.* You don’t need to start from scratch. You just need someone in your corner helping you *continue*.

Second: You are not nothing. You are not a sum total of your worst moments. You are not defined by loss, mistakes, or what’s been taken from you. You are a woman who’s been through hell and is still reaching out for light. That is not weakness. That is *unbelievable strength*.

Third: Let yourself feel. Stop trying to push away the sadness, the anger, the regret. Let them move through you. Cry. Scream. Write. Let the grief burn, but don’t let it define the rest of your life. Because there *is* a life after this. It won’t look like the old one. It may never be the same. But it can still be beautiful. It can still be meaningful.

You are not alone in this darkness. Others have been where you are. And they found a way forward—not because the pain disappeared, but because they learned how to walk with it.

Start with one thing today. One small act of love for yourself. Water. A walk. A journal entry. A message to someone saying *I need you*. That’s how it begins—not with perfection, but with presence.

Your story isn’t over. You are not done. You're still breathing, still fighting, still *trying*—even when it hurts. That matters more than you know.

And I’m with you. Keep going. One breath. One moment. One small act of courage at a time.",1

But we just keep going- we keep going without addressing the real issues and simply continue to line the pockets of pharmaceutical and insurance providers. Moderna beginning to charge money for the Covid-19 vaccines that was initially made free is a great example of how greed gets in the way of caring about public health.

It's a multi-factor problem, but the best way to start fixing it is starting at the top. But it's like, how do we make change happen when dealing with this much greed and ignorance?? Maybe by utilizing the law?? Maybe we elect officials that also prioritize mental healthcare funding? Nothing will happen overnight, but things like this take time.

mentalhealth,108uehy,j4llpcq,"And this is why I don't see a psychiatrist anymore and took it upon myself to get to the root cause of my mental health issues. 
Unless you're schizophrenic, a lot of times people are unnecessarily placed on pharmaceutical drugs, which by the way kill 100,000 people annually IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS ALONE. (Source: FDA/CDC) 
Depression can stem from lack of social support, disconnection from family and friends, low self esteem together with poor diet you've got a recipe for disaster.
Now I'm not telling you to go off your meds or anything silly like that.
I'm suggesting you look at the whole picture of your life.
Do you eat healthy and have a healthy gut? An unhealthy gut can lead to pretty severe depression. Do you eat a lot of refined sugar and carbs? Soda? HFCS? What about exercise? Are you getting enough exercise, sunlight and sleep? Do you have a healthy work/life balance? Do you have worthwhile goals you're pursuing? Is your family supportive? 

Modern medicine simply puts a bandaid on us. It doesn't attempt to address the root cause and actually fix the problem because once a patient is ""cured"" they no longer need the Medical Cartel! 

I found that my diet/exercise, lack of a stimulating and rewarding career and a highly toxic relationship were the cause of my woes. 

I'm off all the drugs I was on (Zoloft, Gabapentin, Elavil, and Ativan) and now I take a multivitamin by Thorne research, L-tryptophan, Fulvic Acid, Activated Charcoal, Biotin, NAC, L-Theanine, and adaotogens such as Lion's Mane and Reishi. I've never felt better in my entire life!",0

mentalhealth,1jtccze,mlt9yqc,"You don’t need to apologize! Not for being long-winded, not for feeling numb, and *definitely* not for being tired. What you wrote here isn’t just a rant; it’s a powerful and honest reflection of where you are right now, and that takes real strength. Whici s why I have to tell you this: Congratulations, you are very brave! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)

What you’re feeling is grief, yes, but it’s also burnout, emotional overload, and the weight of being the strong one in a sea of people who are also hurting. You’re not broken, even if it feels like it. You’re reacting like any human would when they’ve been carrying more than they were ever meant to hold.   
  
You mentioned something that really hit hard: that when you finally break down, you feel *alive*. That tells me you're not numb because you don’t care; you’re numb because you care *too much*, and your brain is trying to protect you from the flood. Remember that emotional shutdown you talked about? Well, it’s a kind of survival. And while it’s not sustainable forever, it makes sense for *now*.

Trying therapy again is a good step, even if it’s hard to afford or slow to start. But in the meantime, I won’t give you those cliché “self-care” tips because I know you’re past that surface-level stuff. What I *will* say is this: you’re not meant to carry all this alone. Not forever. Not even if you’re the one who usually fixes everything. If the people around you are also hurting, maybe it’s not about helping them or them helping you... Maybe it’s just about being broken together for a moment, and letting that be enough. Grief doesn’t always look like sobbing or rituals or mourning; sometimes, it’s quiet, confusing, and messy. It’s numbness. It’s wanting to cry but not knowing how to start. That doesn’t mean you aren’t grieving, no. It means you're grieving in *your* way.

So no fake positivity here. Just this: *You’re tired, and it makes sense. You’re hurting, and it’s allowed. And you’re still here, even after all that!* Still showing up, still reaching out, still holding the pieces together however you can. That matters. *You* matter.",2

mentalhealth,1jc8lgh,mi0axeh,"Finding a good therapist can take some time. You might find a lot of bad therapist before you find a good one. The most important thing is to find someone you feel comfortable with. Use your intuition to see if this is someone you can open up to. Also, you want someone that has some expertise in the area you most need help with.

I don't use therapist for medication, they can't do that. You should see a psychiatrist for medication though. I have depression and OCD. The medication is the biggest help for me. I did therapy to address the past trauma I experienced, but after I talked about that for a year, I don't really see a therapist anymore. I always stay on my meds though, so I see my psychiatrist every 6 months for meds.

Be patient, you might not find a good fit right away. I encourage you to get the proper meds too. Therapy without the meds will not be nearly as impactful. Good luck",1

From my experience it is hard to tell if antidepressants work, so it is possible she’s feeling the same way. Though it seems she isn’t willing to give them much of a chance. Some people just treat mental illness, even if it is their own struggles, as less than physical. It seems she is sadly one of those people. From my experience, once you continue to take medication for mental health and then you forget to take them one day, you realize how much they actually work, maybe she needs a moment like that, but I’m not sure… I hope for both of your sakes she gets better physically and mentally.

Unless I have some abnormal chemical imbalance, I naturally stop eating and have a normal sized appetite. I never had this problem where I couldn't stop eating, even if the food tasted good. Other than Adderall, some other medications like Metformin and Ozembic can also reduce appetite. 

A psychiatrist can prescribe both Adderall and Metformin. I don't know, dude, I would talk to a doctor. Maybe also try to find a group for food addicts, maybe Food Addicts Anonymous or something like that.

mentalhealth,1k70i9q,moumfcm,"I’d say a mix of both anger and understanding is alright. You can’t help being frustrated and angry, and it’s definitely okay to acknowledge those feelings when something like this happens. It’s absolutely not like I want to say she just has a blanket excuse to drop out of plans in the last minute either, I don’t know her, but I would hope to try what I imagine she may be experiencing.

We all perceive, think, and experience the world differently. For a lot of us, actions of knowing what we “should” do follow naturally, without much fuss, because we’re aligned in how we feel and think. But, there’s a really dangerous thing people can experience when those things don’t align. When someone knows they should do something, but something in their mind that they cannot perceive or recognize makes it impossible, no matter how objectively they try to think about it and force that “should” on themselves.

From the way you describe her experience, it sounds like she’s quite aware of what she should do. She *wants* to spend time with you all, she knows it’s probably good for her, and I fear that for her to flip like this, there is an extremely intense anxiety that she can’t place eating away at her. I’m obviously missing a lot of context, I can’t know for sure, but this sort of avoidance is far too often extremely self-deprecating, where the person themself is the one most aware that what their doing is wrong. They feel like they shouldn’t feel this way, but for whatever reason, they *do*. It’s immensely painful, and when they successfully avoid, they often use that to reinforce themselves as a “bad person” who doesn’t deserve things. They can start to believe it’s just simply who they are, when they aren’t.

So, while I can’t be sure, the financial reasoning sounds like an excuse. I don’t think it’s that she simply doesn’t want to, but that she either truly doesn’t know herself why she feels this way or that she doesn’t feel comfortable admitting what that reason is. She could be broadly experiencing a lot of chronic stress that’s eating away at her, maybe her work and financial conditions are at least contributing to that. That experience can mess with us, and how people experience depression and anxiety can differ wildly.

It is really hard to say for sure though. There’s a lot of unknowns. The anger is still allowed, let it be felt since it isn’t the kind if thing we can force away, but I caution directing it at her if she may be overly avoidant or self-deprecating. It’s up to you just how active you want to be and how you want to handle it though.",1

It's possible for meds to have decreased effectiveness after expiration, depending on the medication. - but this is very very unlikely for most medications unless they are stored badly, are liquid, or are one of the specific medications I listed below in quote 2. Basically, if it's a pill and the bottle has been stored in a cool, dry place (not in your bathroom, that's the worst possible place for em!), you have nothing to worry about.


""Solid dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, appear to be most stable past their expiration date. Drugs that exist in solution or as a reconstituted suspension, and that require refrigeration (such as amoxicillin suspension), may not have the required potency if used when outdated.""

""Loel Dawis, expiration date chief said that with a handful of exceptions, notably nitroglycerin, Insulin and Liquid antibiotic most drugs are probably as durable as the agency tested.""

""Most of drug expiration dates information is from the study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration at the request of the military. With a large and expensive stockpile of drugs, the military faced tossing out and replacing its drugs every few years.

mentalhealth,1j277zy,mfpthqm,"I too am going through similar things that you have experienced and you are not alone in feeling this way. I do hope you are also seeking professional medical support, and I highly encourage it even if its hard to do so, to help you work on these thoughts and struggles you are having. It's a horrible feeling to be stuck in this cycle without end in sight, but I believe you can break this cycle and work towards things you want and want to feel. Your feelings are valid and I hope in time you'll be in a much better position. Keep going and take it slowly at your own pace and with guidance to help you move forward with some idea rather than going through this blindly. Stay safe and know I'm here too if you need a person <3.",1
mentalhealth,1j277zy,mfpu7uj,"ok so, ive been depressed and anxious since i was around 10 years old. ive recently been diagnosed with autism, generalized anxiety disorder, depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. im an ex substance abuser (3 year sober from c*ke, 1 year weed free) and i have a court case against my rapist.

my anxiety and depression started young from the way my mother treats me. shes verbally abusive and is very self centred when it comes to pretty much everything. she made me heavily dependant on her and even now i can barely function as a person without her. i was bullied heavily as a child to the point of suicidal ideals. from there it spiraled into substance abuse, a few times being SAed and alot of other bad things. when i was 16 was when i hit rock bottom. i was in college, but barely showed up to classes, was always high and only just passed my course. i dropped out after the first year and spent every moment of my life bed rotting. not able to keep a job, no income, stuck in the house with the woman who turned me into this mess. at 17 i tried college again, i was on anti depressants but because i was still smoking weed and drinking alcohol they didnt do much for me. my mam found out abt the assaults and she made them all about herself. i dropped out of college again and this was probably the worst point if my life. i went completely cold turkey from everything because i no longer had the energy to get out of bed to go get them. i barely ate, my sleep was fucked, i was a mess. it took 2 years to get out of that slump. ive seen 4 different therapists in the course of a year and nothing they said helped. i had an open investigation against my rapist and i could barely get out of bed to talk to the officers to give my statements, to hear their updates etc. i had no friends, nothing. ykw got me out of the slump? spite. i spent alot of that time bedrotting thinking about the people who wronged me. i spent alot of time stalking their social medias and thinking why are they living great lives and im here unable to get out of bed? why are they living great lives and im stuck in bed? becuase im not getting out of bed. so i got out of bed. i walked to the front door, took a breath of fresh air and got right back into bed. but that was more thani did the day before. so i gave myself a challenge, do one more thing each day. i got out of bed, went outside, went back in, put different clothes on, got back into bed. then i brushed my teeth, then i walked the dog, then i watched the tv in the front room rather than my phone in bed. and i eventually got out of the slump. i was still severely depressed, so anxious i didnt walk further than the street. but i did something. from there i got a therapist, one who specialised in my traumas rather than a general one. i enrolled onto a college course in something i had no idea how to do rather than something i already knew. i go to town on the weekends, i go on the train to new places, i do everything i thought id never do again. yes im still depressed, anxious and all the rest. but i do have moments of enjoyment. i can cope with the depression i face. i know this is a long one, and i appreciate it so much if you read it all. the point im trying to put across is that it does get better. it gets manageable. yeah ull have ups and downs and maybe even loop de loop here and there. but it will get easier. you will be able to live a full happy life and cope with your issues. i hope you find some sort of comfort in this thet youre not alone and there is hope for the future",1
mentalhealth,1j277zy,mfpww6r,You’re not alone. I feel the exact same way. I wake up everyday wondering if the day will be better or worse. I hope everyday that things will get better. I hope the same for you.,1
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0gllv5,"I’ve tried some and the only one that has stuck for now is bupropion. Mostly because it energises me and suppresses my appetite, not much else. But without it I do not have energy to live, and lately still I barely can get out of bed.",2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0h6v3l,I have found that Cymbalta works for me. Or I guess I should say did work for me. I did regular SSRI’s for 15 to 20 years and they stopped working because my body just got immune to them. Cymbalta works on norepinephrine too not just serotonin. So originally it made a big difference. I’ve been on it for about eight years now and my body is getting immune to it. Also Zoloft and Wellbutrin and can be a really good combination.,2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0hu6da,"I only take bupropion right now though hopefully I’ll be adding spravato to that soon. I don’t feel like it helps my mood greatly until I miss it; one missed dose and I feel devastated the next day. It mostly helps me regulate energy and sleep (I tend to get 12-14 hours of sleep a night without it), but it’s certainly been helpful enough to stay on it in that regard.",2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0ipo8k,Best drug was imipramine horrific side effects for about 3 weeks night terrors increase panick and anxiety and did alot of sweating. Those side effects went away slept great was able to awake and feel rested felt like what would guess is normal for the first time in my life. Longterm side effects were terrible heart burn some weight gain huge moon face and while doing any exercise could sweat a gallon. The drug stopped working so got a dose increase which helped for 3 months then heart arrhythmia so stopped taking. The drug was cheap had no insurance this was 29 years ago. I have tried many drugs and none have worked much. I had a friend who had a life change with Prozac it sucks that drugs for psch are trial and error. I did not ever have side effects as bad from other drugs. I was willing to tolerate side effects as the drug worked.,2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0gpoq7,"I am diagnosed with mdd, ptsd, ocd, symptoms of bpd but it went away, anxiety, couldn't leave the house, too much Dr's. appt., so I cancelled all of em, incl., p/t, mri, surgery, appt. for cpap, asthma n allergy appt., while I told my psych to write Wellbutrin cause zoloft 150 mg. works better with 75 mg WB ir. After 3 months of pure quiet, ( oh, cbd also) I'm normal again. Every disorder I had is Gone! Because, SSRI + NDRI + CBD = I kicked it's Azz!💪 I'm only on 80 z. and 20 wb- maintenance dose",1
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0h6rzg,"I’ve tried over 60 meds with no luck. My last one given is an MAOI called Nardil it’s not commonly prescribed nowadays as it’s extremely rough on the body and very dangerous but it has helped me maybe 30% which I’ll take. I take olanzapine as my PRN when I’m having an episode to sedate me as benzos weren’t slowing me down at all. I have CPTSD, BPD, depression, anxiety, chronic insomnia, OCD and ADHD. Hopefully you find something that helps you soon!! Fingers crossed",1
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0habv7,"Cipralex. It makes me a bit numb, but considering how bad my anxiety and depression got without it, it's a fair trade. I never want to feel that way again.",1
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0grxgx,I didn’t think the bupropion was doing anything until I ran out. Now I’m waiting for my next appointment so I can get a scheduled refill. I got two weeks off because my boss has been on vacation which never happens but I wasted all that free time sleeping in my room😭 I got no energy at all. I got winded yesterday doing some simple yard work. I feel like shit rn. I’m just thankful I haven’t had an anxiety attack this whole time.,2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0iptcr,I forgot to say drug worked great for 8 months then so so for 3 months before stopping.,2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0ihwsw,"Sucks :( Hope you get em soon! I’ve experienced that too with this and other meds, when it doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything until you get off it and everything falls apart.",2
mentalhealth,1h6vg1h,m0l7yr8,Yea I think it’s even worse because it feels like I’m going through withdrawals. I keep sleeping through my doctor’s office hours so hopefully I can get in touch with them. I’m sleeping through alarms rn.,2
mentalhealth,1jc0z3k,mhymp8x,No. Unless there were brain damage at some point,1
mentalhealth,1jc0z3k,mhymrwo,"I belive that a traumatic birth can affect your psyche. You were probably put away from your mother and was really weak and vulnerable as a premature baby. If being at the NICU is stressful even for adults, imagine how stressful can it be for a baby? It must be worse then animals or dogs going to the vet, since you probably felt unsafe without your mother's protection.",1
mentalhealth,1jfpwdy,miv0xu8,"It's hard to see a parent's marriage crumble, especially when your own mainstay is family. But their problems are not your responsibility. Try to support your mother, but don't forget about yourself. It might be worth trying to find outside support - friends, therapy, or at least a hobby to help you switch gears.



If you want to talk, write in a private message, we'll figure it out together.",2
